## 3- Final Summary for These Laurence - Aristotle’s Intrinsic Teleology (epub)

The article critiques Aristotelian teleology by examining his understanding of explanatory and incidental causes. The author argues that instrumentalization processes contribute to a specific self-actualization process without appealing to unnatural or extrinsic schemes of explanation. The scope of Aristotelian teleology is not limited to the internal functioning of organisms but extends to beings at higher levels of organization, such as communities and ecosystems. The author proposes an organic global teleological perspective, which unifies the specifically distinct ends of natural substances through their common directedness towards achieving and maintaining the form of life. The article notes that Aristotle distinguishes between what is more knowable for us and per se in Posterior analytics books I and II, Metaphysics book A, and De Anima III, emphasizing both the differentiation and continuity of the different objects and ways of knowing them. The distinction between final and efficient causes is a central theme of the article. The author contends that the paradigm of efficient causality i.e., a failure to consider ends as causes in their own right, reveals a commitment to this distinction. This view entails an impoverished conception of teleological causation.

Aristotle considers cities to be entities with a definite nature or form and compares the growth of cities to organic development. He emphasizes that justice is the bond of men in state, suggesting that the administration of justice is the principle of order in political society. He compares the diversity of the parts of a city to that of the internal parts of an organism and suggests that all should partake of excellences of character in such a manner as required by each for the fulfillment of his function.

The article also notes that Aristotle treats political science to some extent like a natural science, and emphasizes that everything exists at the same level of composition according to Johnson's perspective, which is referred to as a 'horizontal' ontology. In contrast, the author proposes an organic global teleological perspective, which unifies the specifically distinct ends of natural substances through their common directedness towards achieving and maintaining the form of life.

The article argues that Aristotle's comments about the instrumental role played by plants in animal development can be reconciled with his narrowly intrinsic view by creating a gap between practical and theoretical knowledge, and suggests that Johnson's reading of the passage from Pol . I 8 is true from the perspective of prudence, but false from the perspective of science.

The article also notes that Aristotle uses the principle of causal adequacy to reject Empedocles' explanation of living things, which implies that order and harmony at higher levels of organization can be nothing more than a happy coincidence. By contrast, Johnson attributes to Aristotle a perspective which entails that order and harmony at higher levels of organization can be nothing more than a happy coincidence. The article suggests that this interpretation is incorrect, as Aristotle's principle of causal adequacy should prevent him from considering something as orderly as the food chain for instance, to be the result of chance.

In conclusion, the article critiques Aristotelian teleology by examining his understanding of explanatory and incidental causes. The author argues that instrumentalization processes contribute to a specific self-actualization process without appealing to unnatural or extrinsic schemes of explanation. The scope of Aristotelian teleology is not limited to the internal functioning of organisms but extends to beings at higher levels of organization, such as communities and ecosystems. The author proposes an organic global teleological perspective, which unifies the specifically distinct ends of natural substances through their common directedness towards achieving and maintaining the form of life.

## 3- Final Summary and Questions for These Laurence - Aristotle’s Intrinsic Teleology (epub)


Summary: This article explores Aristotle's philosophy of hylomorphic teleology, specifically focusing on his view of elements as present in the compound and the role of final causation in teleology. The article argues that recognition of the persistence of elements in composition is necessary for a clear understanding of his teleology because it allows for the distinction between efficient and formal principles. The article highlights several passages from Aristotle's works, including the Politics, Metaphysics, Physics, and History of Animals, to support their interpretation of his philosophy.

Example Questions:
1. What is the main focus of the article regarding Aristotle's philosophy of hylomorphic teleology?
Answer: The article discusses Aristotle's view of elements as present in the compound and the role of final causation in teleology, and argues that recognition of the persistence of elements in composition is necessary for a clear understanding of his teleology. It also highlights the difference between efficient and formal principles.
2. How does the article explain the difference between efficient and formal principles in Aristotle's philosophy?
Answer: The article mentions that the difference lies in the principles, but it does not provide a specific explanation in the given context.
3. What is the view of natural substances implied by Johnson's reading of the passage from Pol . I 8 (2005, p. 231)?
Answer: The article implies that natural substances are not in part-whole relations and everything above and below them is a useful but arbitrary abstraction at best.
4. How does Johnson reconcile Aristotle's comments about the instrumental role played by plants in animal development with his narrowly intrinsic view?
Answer: The article suggests that Johnson creates a gap between practical and theoretical knowledge and says that Aristotle's discussion of instrumental relations in the Politics is true from the perspective of prudence, but false from the perspective of science.

Note: Given the context of the transcript about ecology and commensalism, it may not be relevant to the article on Aristotle's philosophy of hylomorphic teleology.

## 3- Final Summary and Questions for These Laurence - Aristotleâ€™s Intrinsic Teleology (epub)


Summary: This article explores Aristotle's philosophy of hylomorphic teleology, specifically focusing on his view of elements as present in the compound and the role of final causation in teleology. The article argues that recognition of the persistence of elements in composition is necessary for a clear understanding of his teleology because it allows for the distinction between efficient and formal principles. The article highlights several passages from Aristotle's works, including the Politics, Metaphysics, Physics, and History of Animals, to support their interpretation of his philosophy.

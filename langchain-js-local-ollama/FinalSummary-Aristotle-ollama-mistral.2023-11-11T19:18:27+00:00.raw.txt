It challenges a\nnarrowly intrinsic interpretation which rests on a dichotomous conception that\nonly admits of two kinds of goal-directed movements, namely the actualization of\none’s own nature, or the artificial and arbitrary use of another substance. The\nthesis aims at overcoming this dichotomy by highlighting the fact that there are\nintermediary cases according to Aristotle, i.e.  that the relation between agent\nand patient is not always strictly intrinsic or extrinsic. The first chapter\nexamines instrumental relations in crafts  and the second chapter examines\ninstrumental relations in nature, both of which are shown to have their place\nwithin Aristotle’s intrinsic view of teleology. Simply, the thesis argues that\nthe self-actualization of natural substances should be viewed as the focal point\nrather than the exclusive subject of teleological accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOver the last century, a growing number of scholars [1]  have been calling for a\nrenewed interpretation of Aristotle’s teleology because, it is argued, it has\nbeen misunderstood both by its advocates and deterrents who have attributed to\nhim a view of teleology which is extrinsic  in one or both of two senses: [2]  \nfirst , in that the goal-directedness of natural substances has its source in an\nagent which is external to the natural world ( e.g.  an intelligent designer\nwhose intentions  for each natural substance is the cause of their respective\ntendency to realize some goal); and second  in the sense that the purpose of\nnatural substances is the benefit of an external entity for whose good the\nintelligent designer has ordered the world (e.g. God, humans, or the whole\ncosmos). It is said, for instance, that medieval thinkers, in an effort to\nreconcile Aristotelian teleology with the biblical notion of God as creator and\nprovidential supervisor of the world, have attributed to Aristotle a view of\nteleology which entails an intelligent designer, [3]  whereas modern mechanical\nphilosophers [4]  and scientists [5]  have turned away from Aristotelian\nphilosophy of nature on the account that the appeal to divine design to explain\nthe natural order is unjustified and unscientific.

[8]  In an effort to move away from such\ninterpretations, it is often noted that Aristotle in fact deliberately distanced\nhimself from those of his predecessors, like Anaxagoras, [9]  Socrates, and\nPlato, [10]  who attempted to explain the order and beauty of nature by\nappealing to the intentions and deliberative efforts of a divine artist. In\nshort, scholars highlight the contrast between Aristotle’s intrinsic and natural\nteleology and the extrinsic and artificial accounts of his predecessors in order\nto emphasize a view of teleology which grounds goal-directedness in organic\n forces rather than artificial organization , and which constitute a third\noption besides   “blind material determination and intelligent design” .

      "pageContent": "The rediscovery of Aristotle’s intrinsic teleology usually emphasizes one of\nfour corrections to the extrinsic interpretation. (1) First, it is argued that\nends are species specific on Aristotle’s account, [12]  and that the\ndirectionality of natural substances is not towards a uniform purpose such as\n‘serving humanity’. Rather, nature is specifically differentiated and each kind\nof being [13]  has an end which is “better thus (not without qualification, but\nwith reference to the substance in each case)”   ( Ph.  II 7 198b7-8) . [14]  \nThis principle is expressed in both ethics [15]  in the form of what is commonly\ncalled the ergon  argument, [16]  which states that the good of each kind of\nthing corresponds to its specific function. For instance, while the excellence\nproper to the heart is the ability to pump blood, that of a kidney resides in\nits ability to filter it. Since a substance’s function is intimately related to\nits nature, it follows that the good is as diversified as being . Thus, it is\nargued, Aristotle is not concerned with explaining the purpose of animals\ngenerally in the sense of providing a reason for the existence of various animal\nspecies; but rather with explaining how the internal constitution and\nfunctioning of parts contributes to the actualization of a specific mature\n organism. [17]  (1.1) Consequently, some scholars emphasize the fact that\nAristotle is not a global teleologist, at least not in a strong sense [18]\n which entails that all natural substances aim at some general or common good\n[19]  or that there is an ultimate Good which is desired over and above the\nrespective ends of natural substances. [20]  In short, Aristotle’s teleology is\ncontrasted with extrinsic accounts on the basis that it rests on an immanent\nrather than a transcendent view of the good as a cause. (2) Consequently, the\nachievement of the end of a given natural substance is said to be inherently\nvaluable on Aristotle’s account. The goodness of natural substances does not\nhave instrumental value i.e.  it is not an expression of their usefulness to\nGod, Man, or the cosmos. This, it is argued, is a point of contrast with\nartificial teleology, [21]   for  in the craft paradigm, value is measured in\nrelation to something external ( e.g. it is ‘better’ for the knife to be sharp,\nnot  because cutting is good for the knife itself, but rather in relation to the\nartisant who makes or uses the knife); consequently those who make natural\nsubstances into a product of divine craftsmanship tend to conceive of natural\nsubstances as instrumental  in the realization of a divine plan, thus depriving\nthem of inherent value.",

      "pageContent": "(3) Aristotle’s teleology is also contrasted with extrinsic models with respect\nto the identification of the beneficiary of teleological change. [22]  Since (1)\npurposes are species specific, i.e. since natural goal-directedness is a\ntendency proper to each kind of thing to actualize its nature, and since (2) the\nrealization of this end is inherently valuable on Aristotle’s account; it\nfollows that (3) it would be a mistake to say that a natural substance strives\nto achieve its end for the sake of another entity. For instance, if a frog goes\nthrough specific developmental steps for the sake of  actualizing its nature (\ni.e.  realizing the state of affairs which is best - not absolutely, but for the\nkind of being that frogs are), and if this is inherently valuable, then the\nbeneficiary of this developmental process is the frog itself. If however – as\nartificial teleologist assert –  (1) natural substances are ordered for the sake\nof the realization of a universal purpose, and if (2) their value is only\ninstrumental,  then we should maintain that the beneficiary of the development\nof frogs is an external entity for whose good the cosmos has been designed.  \n\n(4) Lastly, Aristotle’s teleology is contrasted with extrinsic and artificial\naccounts with regards to the location of the cause of teleological motion. An\nintelligent designer is the external cause of the good order of the natural\nworld, similar to how an artisant is the external cause of its production. By\ncontrast, it is said that Aristotelian teleology locates the cause of the\nteleological motion or change within [23]  natural substances. In short, since\nAristotle distinguishes nature from crafts with respect to the location of the\nprinciple of motion, [24]   and since he does not conceive of nature as a\nproduct of craft, it is argued that the principle of teleological change must be\nlocated within natural substances on his account. [25]\n\nThis brief summary makes it apparent that references to Aristotle’s intrinsic\n teleology can mean different things. Aristotle’s teleology is considered\nintrinsic first , in the sense that it rests on an immanent   rather than\ntranscendent view of the good; second,  in the sense that it takes the\nrealization of the respective telos of natural substances to be inherently\n valuable; third  because the beneficiary of teleological motion is the natural\nsubstance itself, not another (external) entity; and fourth,  because it locates\nthe cause of teleological change within natural substances rather than in an\nexternal organizer.\n\n\n\n\nTHE NARROW VIEW",

In most cases, their\ncontribution is limited by the fact that teleology is not the primary object of\ntheir inquiry. Nussbaum, for instance, in her first interpretative essay, [26]\n is concerned mainly with answering the Democritean mechanistic view of nature,\nand only clarifies things related to the intrinsic nature of teleological\nexplanations in passing. [27]  Byrne, Broadie, Grene, Ross, Gomperz and Zeller\ntreat the matter similarly; they emphasize the importance of moving away from\nartificial and extrinsic interpretation of Aristotelian teleology, but their\nmain focus is not to provide a detailed interpretation. While Lennox and\nGonzalez’s work is centered on Aristotelian teleology,  it is limited in scope\nboth by the size of their articles and by the fact that they do not confine\nthemselves to the investigation of the intrinsic nature of goal-directedness.\nApart from Johnson, Leroi and Kahn are the ones who grant this question the most\nattention, but their investigations are also limited by the nature of their work\nand their respective interest with the biological [28]  and metaphysical [29]\n dimension of the topic.",

      "pageContent": "As a result, discussions of Aristotle’s intrinsic teleology are often\nincomplete, and we find in the majority of cases a tendency to adopt a narrow\nview of its scope, perhaps in order to emphasize the contrast with extrinsic and\nartificial interpretations. [30]   Ross [31]  and Lennox, [32]   for  instance,\nmake the assumption that Aristotle’s rejection of Plato’s creationist model\nimplies a radical denial of cosmic teleology, as if only an intelligent designer\ncould ground the unity of purposiveness found in the natural world. [33]  In\nother cases, the  scope of teleological accounts is restricted to the internal\nfunctioning of middle sized substances such as plants and animals, on account of\nthe fact that Aristotle considers the purpose of a natural substance to be the\nfulfillment of their respective nature rather than to serve an external entity.\n[34]   In other words, because Aristotle does not consider that the primary\n function of animals and plants is to serve another substance (e.g. humans), it\nis inferred that animals can never   be said to act for the sake of  anything\nbesides their own self-actualization. In these and similar cases, the tendency\nis to reject the strong sense of transcendent [35] , global [36] , instrumental\n[37]  or external [38]  conceptions of final causes and to infer that\nAristotle’s view rests on a strictly  immanent, local, inherently valuable, or\ninternal conception, thus excluding without adequately considering [39]  more\nnuanced senses of the terms.\n\n\n\n\nTHE TASK AHEAD",

      "pageContent": "THE TASK AHEAD\n\nWe consider that these scholars have successfully shown why the extrinsic and\nartificial interpretations of Aristotle’s teleology are problematic. For this\nreason, their contribution is a positive advance on the road to the discovery of\nAristotle’s teleology. The next natural step should be to investigate the\npresuppositions and implications of Aristotle’s intrinsic teleology in a more\nsystematic way. To our knowledge, M.R. Johnson is the only scholar who has\nundertaken this task in his book Aristotle on Teleology. [40]  Johnson argues\nfor an intrinsic interpretation of Aristotelian teleology which he develops in\nclose dialogue with the Aristotelian corpus. A virtue of his  approach is that\nhe treats Aristotle’s works as a unity with which one must engage as a whole.\n[41]  Despite his exhaustive treatment of the question and the vital\nclarifications and textual references he provides, we contend that Johnson’s\ninterpretation cannot be the final word on the subject because it is too\nnarrowly intrinsic and contradicts important Aristotelian doctrines. Johnson’s\ninterpretation relies on an unbalanced view of hylomorphic compounds. In an\neffort to avoid extrinsic accounts of the internal functioning of natural\nsubstances, he undermines the role of the material cause, and consequently, the\nAristotelian view of the dual nature of hylomorphic compounds. His\ninterpretation also relies on a restricted view of the beneficiary of\nteleological change which results in a limited understanding of the way natural\nentities can relate to one another, and in the exclusion of natural systems (\ne.g.  food chains) from the field of study of natural philosophy. His\ninterpretation also presupposes a view of the accidental which is too broad and\nextends to the regular and beneficial relationships of natural substances ( e.g.\n the order of the food chain is just an accidental  result of the respective\nactivities of natural substances on his account) thus violating the principle of\ncausal adequacy. [42]  Finally, Johnson presents a strictly immanent and local\ninterpretation of Aristotle’s teleology [43]  which is not easily reconciled\nwith Aristotle’s teachings on the unity of the good. [44]  We will develop some\n[45]  of these points in due time, for now let this be a sufficient overview of\nthe ways in which we consider Johnson’s interpretation to be narrowly intrinsic.\n\n\nOUR PROJECT",

      "pageContent": "OUR PROJECT\n\nOur project is to contribute to the systematic investigation of Aristotle’s\nintrinsic teleology which has been initiated by Johnson. [46]  While we\ngenerally agree with the intrinsic interpretation outlined above, we seek to\nhighlight its limitations in order to come up with a view that preserves its\ntruth while overcoming its shortcomings. Given spatio-temporal constraints, our\nwork will necessarily be incomplete. In order to be exhaustive, we would need to\naddress the premises and implications of Aristotle’s intrinsic teleology in all\nthe senses laid out above. We should (1) first establish what it means for\nAristotelian teleology to be grounded in inner (natural) principles. In light of\nthis, we should then (2) establish what can constitute the beneficiary of\nteleological change, [47]  and (3) investigate Aristotle’s view on the unity of\nthe good as a cause; both within nature, and the whole cosmos. Lastly, we should\nexplore (4) the fundamental place of activity ( energeia ) in Aristotelian\nteleology, and inquire into the explanatory role of the prime mover. In this\npaper, we will undertake only the first of these steps. Our research will\nconsist in an investigation of the foundations and ramifications of a view of\nteleology which is said to be intrinsic because it has its foundation in natural\n(inner) causes. More precisely, our purpose is to clarify the place of\ninstrumental relations within Aristotle’s naturalistic perspective on teleology.\nThis is a point of contention because instrumental relations presuppose alterity\n, meaning that they involve two separate entities, one of which imposes a\npurpose which does not belong to the other intrinsically. Because this is not\neasily reconciled with the intrinsic conception of final causes, many scholars\nsimply exclude all instrumentalization processes from the scope of Aristotelian\nteleology. This simplistic solution rests on a dichotomous conception which only\nadmits of two kinds of goal-directed movements, namely the actualization of\none’s own nature, or the artificial and arbitrary use of another substance.\n\n\n\n\nTHE INTERNALITY OF NATURAL CAUSES",

      "pageContent": "THE INTERNALITY OF NATURAL CAUSES\n\nThroughout our work, we will challenge the dichotomous conception of natural and\nartificial causes which, we will argue, gives rise to a mistaken view of the\ncontrast between Aristotle’s natural teleology with the artificial accounts of\nhis predecessors. It is common [48]  to establish the distinction between\nnatural and artificial schemes of explanation first,  with regards to the\nlocation of the principle of organization, an d second  with respect  to the\nrole played by psychological attitudes such as intentions and desires. In short,\nthe common view is that (1) Aristotelian teleology grounds explanations in the\nnature of substances i.e.  in an internal  principle of organization, whereas\nartificial teleologists explain the order and beauty of the natural world with\nreference to an external  organizer; and that (2) while Aristotle conceives\ngoal-directedness as a self-actualization process i.e. as the expression of the\nbeing of the substance which changes for the sake of something, artificial\nteleologists rather consider it to be an expression of divine intentions i.e. ‘\npurpose’ is understood psychologically, while for Aristotle it has an\nontological meaning.\n\nAlthough there is some truth to this way of presenting the contrast, it is\nimportant to establish in what sense it is true and to draw the right\nconclusions, for we notice that a failure to establish certain nuances sometimes\nlead to simplistic and problematic views of the opposition of craft and nature\nand to an impoverished understanding of both. Johnson for instance concludes\nthat (a) nature is to be understood exclusively  in terms of internally caused\nself-actualization processes; and that (b) instrumentalization processes – which\nhe confines to the domain of craft [49]  – remain outside the scope of genuine\nteleological explanations. This leads him to (a) undermine the hylomorphic\nconception of natural substances, and to (b) distort the Aristotelian view of\ncrafts by divorcing them from their ontological basis (and consequently,\nemphasizing their psychological dimension). We will challenge both these\nsuppositions (and the resulting restrictions of the scope of teleology)\nthroughout our work. Our first chapter will challenge the (b) exclusion of\nartificial goal-directed processes from the scope of Aristotelian teleology and\nour second chapter will contest the (a) strictly internalist view of natural\nchange.",

      "pageContent": "Because of the exhaustive nature of Johnson’s work, he will be our primary\ninterlocutor. Let us therefore provide a more comprehensive account of his view\nin order to delineate the contrast with our own. Fundamentally, Johnson’s view\nrests on three premises; the priority of nature over the arts, the internality\nof natural causes, and the identification of internal and explanatory causes.\n[50]  From these he concludes that Aristotle’s natural teleology is rooted\nexclusively in internal causes and consequently excludes instrumental relations\nfrom its scope. In the course of our work, we will contest the third premise and\nchallenge the resulting limitations of the scope of Aristotelian teleology.\nJohnson rightly insists that the distinction between natural and artificial\ncauses lies in the location of the principle of motion. [51]  He also does well\nto highlight the distinction between intrinsic and incidental causes; the former\nbeing explanatory and therefore relevant to scientific investigations, and the\nlatter not suitable for grounding a teleological (or any kind of scientific)\nexplanation. [52]  However, we will argue that his account becomes problematic\nwhen [53]   he treats  these two distinctions as coextensive, [54]  and infers\nthat only internal causes are explanatory and can ground scientific\nexplanations. We find in Johnson’s work no satisfactory justification for\ntreating these distinctions as coextensive, yet the consequences he draws from\nthis are significant, namely that any good a natural substance may contribute to\nis incidental to it, and thus irrelevant to theoretical science. The result is a\npolarizing view of nature and the arts where nature is the domain of strictly\nintrinsic principles, whereas crafts is associated with extrinsic and incidental\ncauses.  This antithetical view of nature and the arts is best illustrated by\nthe table he includes on top of p.203  where he compares the intrinsic and\ninternal final causes of a horse ( e.g.  life and reproduction) with its\nincidental and external ends ( e.g.  gambling and racing). While Johnson is\nright to insist that the latter have no place in the scientific explanation of\nhorses, we contend it is a mistake to suppose that all  external goods to which\na horse may contribute are equally arbitrary and scientifically irrelevant. In\nsimple terms, it rests on the premise that there exists no middle ground between\nthe self-actualization and arbitrary use of a natural substance. [55]",

      "pageContent": "We will challenge this premise and Johnson’s defense of it in due time but\nfirst, let us consider Aristotle’s own discussion of the internality of natural\ncauses and attempt to shed light on his view of their opposition to artificial\nones, for once we have a firmer grasp of Aristotle’s perspective, we will be in\na better position to determine the limits of Johnson’s interpretation.   In the\nopening section of book II of the Physics , Aristotle defines nature as an inner\nprinciple of motion and rest. [56]  This is often interpreted as meaning that\nthe distinction between natural and artificial change is grounded in the spatial\nlocation [57]  of the principle of motion. For instance, while a puppy has\nwithin itself the cause of its development into a dog (its soul), the cause of a\nbed is outside the bed, in the builder. The soul, being in  the dog, is an\ninternal, thus natural  cause, whereas the builder is an external, thus\nartificial  cause. Although there is some truth to this view, we will argue that\nit does not constitute the whole truth, for the internality of natural causes\nshould not be understood only in a physical sense. This is made manifest by the\nfact that, according to Aristotle, (1) some causes are physically internal yet\nnot natural, and (2) some natural changes have a cause which is located ‘in\nother things’.\n\nLet us first consider the rest of the opening passage of Physics II 1 which\nsuggests that physical internality does not, in and of itself, make a cause the\nnatural  principle of the motion it initiates:\n\nnature is a cause of being moved and of being at rest in that to which it\nbelongs primarily, in virtue of itself and not accidentally. I say ‘not\naccidentally’ because (for instance) a man who is a doctor might cure himself.\nNevertheless it is not insofar as he is a patient that he possesses the art of\nmedicine: it merely has happened that the same man is doctor and patient – and\nthat is why these attributes are not always found together. So it is with all\nother artificial products. None of them has in itself the principle of its own\nproduction. But while in some cases (for instance houses and other products of\nmanual labour ) that principle is in something else external to the thing, in\nothers – those which may cause a change in themselves accidentally – it lies in\nthe things themselves (but not in virtue of what they are).

The distinction\nbetween intrinsic and incidental   causes is most clearly laid out in the fifth\nchapter of the second book of the Physics  where it is established that i\nntrinsic causes are essentially ( in virtue of what they are ) related to the\nresult they produce (and are therefore causally relevant) whereas incidental\ncauses are accidentally connected to the effect “For example, the intrinsic\ncause of a house is the builder, but coincidentally it is the pale or the\nmusical.” ( Ph . II 5, 196b25). [59]  The builder is the intrinsic cause of the\nhouse because he is essentially related to the house qua  builder and the art of\nbuilding (which makes him a builder) explains the production of the house. By\ncontrast, there is no necessary connection between being pale and the production\nof a house, thus the pale is an incidental (non-explanatory) cause of the house.\nAs attested by his choice of example, in this passage Aristotle is not opposing\nart to nature as a cause; rather, insofar as they are intrinsically related to\ntheir effect both are opposed to chance.",

By contrast, it is not by chance that a natural cause is\ninternal. The soul for instance, cannot possibly exist outside the body and\nshape it from the outside; it is an internal cause by its very nature\n(intrinsically). But what does it mean for natural causes to be internal in\nvirtue of what they are ?   Why is the soul (and natural causes generally)\nnecessarily in  the patient? Is the soul glued to the body with a very strong\ntype of glue i.e.  is it just physically inseparable from the body? The soul,\nAristotle says on multiple occasions, [60]  constitutes the formal, final, and\nefficient principle of the living body, which means the efficient and final\nprinciples are identified to the formal cause of the body. Thus the final and\nefficient principles of the living body are necessarily in it because of their\nidentity with its essence. In the second book of the treatise On the Soul ,\nAristotle defines the soul as “an actuality of the first kind of a natural\norganized body” ( De An.  II 1, 412b5) . [61]   Thus i t is clear that the\ninseparability of body and soul is not only physical, for the soul is “substance\nin the sense which corresponds to the account of a thing. That means that it is\nwhat it is to be for a body of the character just assigned.” ( De An.  II 1,\n412b10 ). [62]  In other words, the soul and the living body are not just\nnecessarily connected, they are one . [63]  In this resides the contrast with\ncrafts, for an artist and its product, although they are essentially related,\nare nonetheless distinct entities. Generally then, a natural cause is\nintrinsically  internal because agent and patient are in a sense [64]  \nidentical .",

VIII 4, 254b20). [65]  Consider for instance the case of\nelemental motion; the elements, although they are set in motion ‘by something\nelse’, are moved naturally , says Aristotle, when the motion is in accordance\nwith their inner inclination. “When fire and earth, then, are by force moved by\nsomething, they move contrary to nature, but they do so by nature when they are\nengaged in the activities that, in potentiality, are their own.”  ( Ph . VIII,\n4, 255 a25-27) [66]  Elemental motion can be natural even if it is initiated by\nan external cause according to Aristotle, for although the proximate efficient\ncause of the motion is physically external to the elements, they nonetheless\nhave within themselves [67]  a (passive) principle, which is the explanatory\n(intrinsic) cause of their motion. In this, Aristotle says, elemental motion is\nanalogous to the fall of a heavy object; in a sense it is caused by the agent\nwho removes what was preventing it from falling but in truth, this agent “is the\naccidental cause of motion; and in the same way the rebounding ball is moved not\nby the wall but by the thrower.” ( Ph . VIII, 4, 255 b25) [68] ; in such a case,\nthe explanatory cause of the motion is “a source of motion – not of moving\nsomething or of causing motion, but of suffering it.” ( Ph . VIII 4, 255 b30)\n[69] ; a principle which, in the case of elements, is internal  (and not\nincidentally, for this natural tendency constitutes their essence). Therefore,\nalthough they are in a sense moved by something else, the explanatory cause of\ntheir motion is an intrinsically  internal principle.",

      "pageContent": "To clarify what this means, it will be useful to consider the passage [70]\n which precedes the one just cited, where Aristotle distinguishes between two\nkinds or degrees of potency. Something may be called potential (1)in the sense\nthat it is receptive of a given determination or capacity e.g.  the bronze is\npotentially a statue or (2) in the sense that it has a capacity, but is being\nprevented from actualizing it e.g.  a heavy object held up in the air is\npotentially on the ground.   The second sense is more ‘actual’, and in fact\ncorresponds to what Aristotle elsewhere calls ‘first actuality’. [71]  To\nillustrate this contrast, he suggests that we compare the way in which an\nignorant man and a scientist who is not actively contemplating (say, because he\nis sleeping) are said to be ‘capable’ of scientific contemplation. [72]  Things\nwhich are naturally  moved by something else have a potency which, Aristotle\nsays, is akin to that of the sleeping scientist rather than that of the ignorant\nman. The passive principle present in the elements thus corresponds to a first\ndegree of actuality. To elaborate on the analogy, if someone were to wake up the\nscientist, we should call him the incidental cause of the scientific\ncontemplation which then occurs, for he is not by virtue of what he is  a cause\nof scientific contemplation. The explanatory cause in this case is rather the\nknowledge in  the former sleeper. Thus the actualization of scientific\ncontemplation, although initiated by an external agent, is natural because the\nexplanatory cause is intrinsically  internal to the scientist. Similarly,\nalthough the motion of elements towards their natural place is initiated by\nsomething external, the explanatory cause is their inner inclination, which is\nintrinsically  internal, for it constitutes their essence. In short, elemental\nmotion is natural because the external mover is only an incidental cause of the\nmotion.\n\nLet us also note that even in the case of living things, Aristotle thinks many\nnatural functions have their source in a physically external principle. [73]\n Respiration, increase and decrease (development and deterioration), and other\nsuch natural   activities are said to have their source in external\nenvironmental factors, [74]  and the generation of animals and plants is in a\nsense externally caused because the parent is (numerically) distinct from the\noffspring. In the treatise on the Generation of Animals, Aristotle says the\nfollowing concerning the externality of the cause of natural generation:",

And it is possible for this to have\nmoved that, and that this other, and for it to be like those wondrous automata.\nFor their parts somehow contain a capacity when at rest, and when something\nexternal has moved the first of them immediately the contiguous one becomes so\nactively . As, then, in the case of these automata the external thing is in a\ncertain way moving them, not by making contact with any part now, but by having\nmade contact with one, it is likewise in the case of what the seed came from, or\nthat which produced the seed, it moves by having once made contact, not by\nmaking contact still.

In that passage, the art of building was said\nto be the explanatory cause of the house by contrast with the pale and the\nmusical. Thus it is plausible to think that when he says “it is the internal\nmovement that does this, as building does the hous e” , he is identifying the\ninternal movement with the builder (the intrinsic cause of the house), thus\nimplicitly comparing the parent (external mover) to the pale or musical (the\nincidental cause of the house). The outcome of the argument is therefore that\nthe parent (external mover) is only an incidental cause of the generation of\nparts; whereas the principle of motion which is in  the semen is the explanatory\ncause of the process. This aligns with what we have said about elemental motion.\nThe generation of parts is natural even if the parent is external because the\nexplanatory cause is by virtue of what it is  in the semen. The semen, like the\nelements (and also like the parts of the automaton) “somehow contain a capacity\nwhen at rest” , a capacity which we have said corresponds to a first degree of\nactuality. The difference between the case of the movement of automata and that\nof natural generation or elemental motion lies in the relation which holds\nbetween the passive and active principles. [76]  A potentiality is somehow\ncontained in the parts of the automaton, but this is the result of the\norganizing activity of an external agent. Later in the passage from the\nGeneration of Animals , Aristotle says that “whatever comes to be by nature or\nby craft comes to be due to something actively being, from something potentially\nbeing, of the relevant sort.” ( GA  II 1, 734 b25) [77]  By ‘principles of the\nrelevant sort’ he means explanatory principles, by contrast with irrelevant\n(incidental) “causes”. While it is possible to identify explanatory (‘relevant’)\ncauses in both art and nature, the difference lies in the fact that in nature,\nthe active and passive principles are one and the same whereas in craft they are\ndifferent. A form is already present in the semen, which is potentially  an\norganism, whereas the form of the machine is different from and external to the\nmetal which is potentially  the automa ton (for it resides in the soul of the\nengineer). In other words, in nature the passive principle already contains\nwithin itself a certain capacity - which corresponds to a first degree of\nactuality , thus the active and passive principles are one .  The potentiality\nof the semen is therefore akin to that of the sleeping scientist, whereas that\nof metal is akin to the capacity of the ignorant man.",

      "pageContent": "We can now go back to the passage from Physics  II 1 where nature is defined as\nan inner principle of motion and state with clarity what it means. The\ninternality of natural causes has to be understood both physically and\nessentially, for as we have said, natural causes are intrinsically internal. Let\nus reemphasize the fact that natural causes can be described as intrinsic in two\nways. First, generally, in the sense that they are by virtue of what they are\n related to the result they produce. In this respect, they are like artificial\ncauses and unlike chance (and other incidental causes). Second, natural causes\nare said to be by virtue of what they are , internal to the patient in which\nthey produce a change. This second qualification indicates a deeper unity of\nmover and moved . It is in this respect that natural principles can be\ncontrasted with artificial causes, for the latter can be internal only\nincidentally. In short, agent-patient relations in craft are intrinsic only in\nthe first sense, whereas in nature, the relation is intrinsic in both senses.\nThus when qualifying natural causes as ‘intrinsic’, it is important to specify\nwhich of these senses we have in mind, for their confusion may lead to unclarity\nregarding the differentiation of natural, artificial, and incidental causes. In\norder to avoid confusion, we have adopted the term explanatory  to refer to the\ngeneral sense in which both natural and artificial causes are contrasted with\nincidental causes because they are intrinsically (in virtue of what they are )\nrelated to their effects. We reserve the term intrinsic  specifically for the\nrelation which holds between a natural principle and its effect.\n\nOn our interpretation therefore, we may distinguish natural, artificial, and\nincidental causes with regards to three types of relations, namely (1) an\nexplanatory or incidental relation (2) a physical relation of internality or\nexternality, and (3) an intrinsic or extrinsic essential relation (see the table\nbelow).\n\n\n\nExplanatory / Incidental\n\nIntrinsic / Extrinsic\n\nInternal/ External\n\nChance\n\nIncidental\n\nExtrinsic\n\nEither\n\nArt\n\nExplanatory\n\nExtrinsic\n\nEither\n\nNature\n\nExplanatory\n\nIntrinsic\n\nInternal*\n\n\n\nNote that the physical location of causes is not, in and of itself, a\ndetermining factor in differentiating causes. Indeed as established above, some\nnatural processes may involve external causes (*so long as they correspond to a\nprinciple intrinsic to the patient [78] ), and some artificial causes may happen\nto be within the patient.\n\n\n\n\nJOHNSON’S INTERPRETATION",

      "pageContent": "JOHNSON’S INTERPRETATION\n\nLet us now return to Johnson’s perspective and attempt a more detailed account\nof its shortcomings. First, it may be useful to include a comparative table in\norder to illustrate the contrast between his view and our own. Notice that the\nfirst two columns are merged into one, for as we have said, Johnson treats the\ntwo distinctions as coextensive. Note also that the physical location of causes\ndoes play a role in the differentiation of causes on his account.\n\nIntrinsic / Incidental\n\nInternal/ External\n\nChance\n\nIncidental\n\nExternal\n\nArt\n\nIncidental\n\nExternal\n\nNature\n\nIntrinsic\n\nInternal\n\n\n\n\nWe have said above that Johnson correctly establishes the internal and\nexplanatory [79]  character of natural causes, but then proceeds to use the\nterms interchangeably, and we are now in a position to examine and challenge\nthis last step. In section 2.7 of his book, Johnson contrasts explanatory causes\nwith incidental ones. In addressing the difficulty of delineating between the\ntwo, he claims that “the solution is to come up with a means of distinguishing\nbetween uses of an eye that are natural from those that are incidental” [80]  \nthus  contrasting natural and incidental causes, seemingly forgetting that\nAristotle’s own illustration of explanatory causes (cited by Johnson himself on\nthe previous page) is taken from the domain of craft. A charitable reading of\nJohnson’s comment could suppose that he uses ‘natural’ loosely, in the sense of\n‘essential’ and not specifically in opposition to craft i.e. that he means  to\nsay that the solution is to come up with a means of distinguishing between uses\nof an eye which are essentially related to eyeness from those which are merely\nincidental. However, what he says elsewhere indicates that he does mean to\noppose natural and incidental   causes and consequently, explanatory and\nartificial ones. [81]  Johnson’s reason for identifying internal and explanatory\ncauses is most clearly laid out on p.202-203, where he cites a passage from De\nAnima  which establishes that self-movers cannot be moved by something else\nintrinsically, and that similarly, a process which is for the sake of an\nintrinsic final cause cannot occur for the sake of  an external good.\n\nAn animal may be pushed along by force but something that has been moved by\nitself included in its substance cannot be moved by something else except\ncoincidentally - just as what is intrinsically good because of itself cannot be\ngood because of something else or for the sake of something else. ( De An.  I 3,\n406 b8) [82]\n\n\n\nFrom this, Johnson infers that, since natural substances have intrinsic\npurposes, any other good they contribute to is incidental to them. On this view,\ninternal, natural, and explanatory causes are equivalent i.e. to have a nature\nis to have an internal cause, and this is the same as to say an explanatory\ncause; whereas all external causes are incidental, and thus scientifically\nirrelevant.",

      "pageContent": "The problem with Johnson’s interpretation of the De Anima  passage cited above\nbecomes clear if we pay attention to the context of Aristotle’s remark and\nconsequently, to the restricted sense in which we are to understand them.  The\nfirst part of the analogy establishes that the external efficient cause of an\nanimal’s locomotion is necessarily incidental because animals are by nature\nself-movers in this respect . Recall however, that Aristotle says elsewhere that\nsome animal motions (in fact all but locomotion) require the intervention of an\nexternal force. [83]  Thus when he says that self-movers cannot be moved\nintrinsically by external agents, it is clear that he has in mind only the\nrestricted sense in which animals move themselves (locally), and that it would\nbe a mistake to interpret him as asserting that any change which is externally\ncaused ( e.g.  respiration) is incidental to animals.\n\nBearing this in mind,  if we now consider the second part of the analogy which\nconcerns final causes, it becomes apparent that Aristotle’s claim that “what is\nintrinsically good because of itself cannot be good because of something else or\nfor the sake of something else ”   does  not entail, as Johnson argues, that a\nnatural substance can never   be said to act for the sake of  another substance\nexcept incidentally. Rather, we should understand this affirmation in the\nlimited sense that the self-actualization of natural substances, because it is\nfor the sake of  an intrinsic final cause, does not have instrumental value. For\ninstance, we should say that the growth of a horse, because it is for the sake\nof an intrinsic purpose (the actualization of its form), cannot be explained\nwith reference to an external good. However, the fact that its growth is not for\nthe sake of an external good does not exclude the possibility that other aspects\nof its natural life ( e.g.  some features of its feeding habits)  may be\nexplained with reference to an end which does not, strictly speaking, belong to\nthe horse intrinsically ( e.g.  the good order of the ecosystem it inhabits).\nConsequently, we contend   that the De Anima  passage which Johnson cites in\nsupport for his identification of internal and explanatory causes does not in\nfact exclude the possibility that some  external causes may be scientifically\nrelevant, and therefore does not give ground to his implicit premise that there\nexists no middle ground between the  self-actualization and arbitrary use of\nnatural substances.

[86]  Indeed,  if Aristotle considered all external\ncauses to be incidental, it is surprising that he considered craft-based\nexamples to be so enlightening. We have indicated above that a common way to\ncontrast natural and artificial teleology rests on a sharp demarcation between\nnatural processes of self-actualization (which are for the sake of an end in an\nontological sense) and artificial instrumentalization processes (which are for\nthe sake of a goal in a psychological sense). [87]  In this view, craft\nanalogies can be useful insofar as artificial processes manifest a likeness to\ngenuine (natural) goal-directedness, but accounts of their pedagogical value are\noften [88]  accompanied by a warning that the comparison must not be taken too\nseriously, with a special emphasis on the fact that the analogy is not meant to\nestablish that natural processes are the result of intentions or desires. This,\nit is argued, would constitute a dangerous overstretch of the analogy. [89]   In\nthis view, while it may at first [90]   be useful for natural philosophers to\nconsider cases of artificial goal-directedness in order to familiarize\nthemselves with means-end relations, they should then leave these considerations\nbehind as they move on to investigate natural goal-directedness. In short, this\nview presupposes that genuine teleological accounts do not, in truth, apply to\nthe domain of craft. Because the scholars who adopt this view usually do not\nconsider artificial causes to be genuine explanatory causes, the heuristic value\nof craft analogies rests on fairly superficial [91]  similarities and it makes\nit questionable why Aristotle would so consistently rely on them all throughout\nthe corpus (and not just at the very beginning of the Physics  for instance).\n[92]  In short, Aristotle's consistent use of craft analogies suggests that it\nrests on a more fundamental symmetry [93]  of natural and artificial causes than\ntheir view allows.\n\nIn what follows we will challenge the dichotomous view of nature and the arts\nand try to provide a more accurate account of the analogy which Aristotle\nestablishes between them. We will also clarify Aristotle’s objection to\nartificial teleology which, we will argue, rests not  on an exclusion of\nartificial processes from the scope of teleological explanations, but rather on\nhis view of their relation to natural ones. We will suggest that Aristotle\nconsidered the similarities between craft  and nature to be  very profound and\nthat reestablishing the priority of nature over the arts allows for a deeper\ngrasp of their unity.\n\n\n\n\nCRAFT ANALOGIES",

Her\ncontribution is significant because she addresses the question in a\ncomprehensive manner and develops her analysis well beyond the common and\nsimplistic view that the analogy is meant to establish that nature, like art, is\npurposeful. She notes that the goal-directedness of nature is in fact often\ntaken as an established starting point, and that the analogy rather serves to\nspecify what it means to say that natural substances are goal-directed. She\nnotes five points of analogy, [94]   i.e.  five things which the craft analogy\nis meant to teach us about natural teleology,   t hree of which   are worth\nexamining for our present purposes.\n\nThe first [95]  is the species-specific character  of artificial goal-directed\n processes . Broadie notes that c rafts, unlike many  activities, mirror the\nspecific differentiation of the natural world. Accordingly, she thinks  the\ncraft analogy serves to establish that natural substances , like craftsmen, are\nagents which direct a developmental process towards a specific  form or\nstructure. Thus an important  contribution of the craft analogy is that it\nallows us to grasp goal-directedness as a  specifically differentiated rather\nthan uniform phenomena . As she puts it; “without the craft analogy, we should\nstill have teleological  explanation, but not the Aristotelian concept of\nnatural substances.” [96]   In short, the craft analog y   teaches us that\ngoal-directedness is rooted in the specific nature   of the being which is\nactualized through a  teleological  process. In li ne with this, c onsider the\nfollowing craft analogy taken from the treatise on Respiration :\n\nT he arts t hemselves achieve these different results, for that by using fire as\nan instrument they soften, liquefy, and desiccate substances, and some they\ntemper. Individual natures work in the same way, and so they differ one from\nanother; so that it is ridiculous to judge by externals; for whether we regard\nthe heat as separating or refining, or whatever the effect of warming or burning\nis, the results will be different according to the different natures of the\nagencies which employ it. But while the crafts use the fire merely as an\ninstrument, nature uses it as a material as well. ( Resp. 485 a30-b5) [97]",

This suggests, as we argued in our\nintroduction, that natural change is characterized – and differentiated from\ncraft –with regards to the intrinsic   relation of agent and patient.  Let us\nrecall however that although artificial causes are not intrinsic, they are, like\nnatural causes, essentially related to their effect in the general sense that\nthey are explanatory rather than incidental causes. In this resides the second\n[98]  point of analogy highlighted by Broadie. She notes that many goal-directed\n activities are incidental to the agent ; she mentions for instance   going to\nthe neighbor's house to inquire about recent news ,  an activity which does not\nbelong to man  in virtue of what he is . She highlights the fact that t he\ncognitive faculties which make  this activity  possible ( e.g.  language and\nsocial skills) are not meant directly or primarily  for this  activity.  In\nshort, gossiping is only a  possible use of th ese  facult ies, and thus\nconstitutes an incidental end of man.  By contrast ,  the cognitive faculties\nwhich allow a craftsman to practice his art are essentially related to the\nproduction of a specific artifact. Broadie argues that Aristotle deliberately\nestablishes the comparison with craft instead of other goal-directed activities\nbecause he wants to emphasize the explanatory character of natural causes.

As noted\nabove, it is common to consider the place of deliberation to be a point of\ndis-analogy   between craft and nature, and to insist that the two must be\ndistinguished in this respect in order to avoid importing psychological views of\ngoal-directedness which lead to extrinsic and artificial views of nature. As\nBroadie rightly notes, [101]  Aristotle in fact considers psychological\nattitudes such as intending or desiring   to   be  secondary even in crafts .\nThis, she says, is part of what makes them  helpful in understanding natural\ngoal-directedness. [102]   She notes, for instance, that according to Aristotle,\na builder qua builder is not said to build because of his intentions or desires,\nrather  “a man builds because he is a builder, but the builder builds in virtue\nof the building craft.”   ( Ph.  II 3, 195b22) [103]  Thus she challenges a\nmisconception [104]  of artificial goal-directedness which identifies the\npersonal motivations of the craftsman [105]  with the final cause of his\nactivity. This is an important point which merits a more exhaustive discussion.\n\n\n\n\nA NON PSYCHOLOGICAL CONCEPTION OF PURPOSES\n\nIn Physics II 8, Aristotle seems to bridge a gap between nature and the arts by\nclaiming that in crafts, as in nature, goal directedness is not  rooted in\ndeliberation. “It is ridiculous for people not to believe that something is\ncoming about for the sake of something if they do not see that the moving cause\nhas deliberated . Yet craft too does not deliberate.” (Ph. II 8, 199b 26) [106]\n  O f course, Aristotle is not denying that there is a place for deliberation in\nthe arts. Rather, he challenges the view  that the presence of deliberation is\nwhat grounds the claim that artificial processes are   goal-directed . [107]  To\nclarify the proper role of deliberation in the arts, let us remember that for\nAristotle, deliberation always concerns means, never ends . [108]   It follows\nthat even in craft  the end is prior to, and therefore not grounded in\ndeliberation. This clarification might not satisfy those who wish to deny\ngoal-directedness to non-human nature ; t hey may still object that although\ndeliberation is posterior to purposes, these purposes are grounded in\npsychological attitudes such as intending or desiring – and since these cannot\nbring about good results in and of themselves (without the deliberation and\nintervention of an agent) the question remains as to how nature can be said to\nact for the sake of something  if it does not deliberate. In other words,\nclarifying the secondary role of deliberation does not address the fundamental\nmistake of those to whom the comments from Physics  II 8 are directed; what\nneeds to be addressed is their psychological understanding of purposes   i.e.\n the view that a purpose is ‘something desired’.

In short, Aristotle considers purposes to be primarily\nrooted in the notion of the good, not in psychological attitudes such as\nintending or desiring. [110]  Purposes are desired by conscious agents because\nthey are good , not the other way around,   and t eleological accounts in both\ncraft and nature are explanations of something happening because it is good, not\nbecause someone intended or desired it.   In book VII of the Metaphysics, [111]\n Aristotle explains that h ealth, not the doctor’s intention, constitutes the\nend of the medical art. The doctor takes a series of steps for the sake of\nrestoring health , and this  can be understood independently of the intentions\nof the doctor. According to Aristotle, e verything about the medical  art,\nincluding the artists’ intentions and deliberative efforts , is grounded in a\ndefinite form (in this case, health). [112]  Thus  even in artificial\nteleological accounts, purposes are grounded in being  and should not be\npsychologized . In other words, it would be a mistake to think that the doctor\nchooses the end to be pursued in the sense that his choice explains or\ndetermines the end of the medical art. This is why, as we’ll see below, one\ncannot invent [113]  a new craft simply by deciding to pursue an arbitrary\n“goal”. According to the Aristotelian view of crafts, the artist neither creates\nthe material nor the formal principle of artifacts, [114]   his  role is simply\nto deliberate on the best way to instantiate pre-existing forms in pre-existing\nmaterials. Thus the intentions of craftsmen are subordinated to, and cannot be\nunderstood apart from the specific forms of artifacts. In her discussion of the\ncraft analogy, Broadie [115]  notes that Aristotle focuses on craft at the\nexpense of a myriad of human activities whose intentional character should make\nthem just as relevant if purposes were grounded in intentions.  We have already\nexplored some of the reasons why Aristotle considers some intentional actions to\nbe better illustrations  of teleological processes . We shall now go one step\nfurther and ask whether all intentional actions can even be said to be\npurposeful. Take for instance the extreme case of the behavior of mad people.\nTheir actions, although intentional, are ‘senseless’. Their intentional and\ndeliberate nature might make them appear  goal-oriented, but most people would\nagre e that they are no more ‘purposeful’ than the severed member is ‘a hand’.\nWe suggest it is the nature of their  ‘goals’ which makes these  actions\nsenseless.   Because he is out of touch with reality the madman’s goals are not\nrooted in being, they are ‘not real goals’.

Those who have a psychological conception of purposes should say\nthat the shape which the madman intends to instantiate constitutes a goal, and\nthat there can be a teleological account of his deliberate actions, which are\nmeans to achieve this desired  end. By contrast, Aristotle would say that\nregardless of his intentions and deliberative efforts, the madman is not acting\npurposefully because his goal is not grounded in being, and his actions do not\ncontribute to the actualization of a specific form. In short, given the\nsecondary place of desires and intentions in Aristotle’s account, there can be\nno genuine intention in the absence of a real end. The upshot is that intentions\nand goal-directedness are indeed intimately related, but not because the former\nis a cause of the latter. On the contrary, the dependence runs in the opposite\ndirection. [118]   It follows that, according to Aristotle, those who grant that\nhuman actions are teleologically explicable only because they see an agent\ndeliberating have misunderstood what makes even these actions purposeful.\nAccording to Aristotle, t his misunderstanding is characteristic of both\nteleological deniers (those who think nature can only be purposeful if it\ndeliberates) and artificial teleologist s (those who explain the purposiveness\nof natural substances with reference to the intentions of a divine artist), both\nof whom fail  to identify the proper cause of goal-directedness.

This is why, although he recognized that some of his\npredecessors [122]  had foreseen the need to resort to the good to explain the\norder and beauty of nature, Aristotle did not consider them to have developed an\nadequate understanding of the way in which the good is a cause. We have said\nthat, according to  Aristotle, the doctor’s intentions are not the primary cause\nof the good realized through the practice of medicine, [123]  health is.

( Pol . I 8, 1256 b25 ) [126]  \n\n\n\nThe way in which an animal provides for itself is grounded in its nature – e.g.\n its hunting habits are derived from  its nutritional needs, which are\ndetermined by its nature. Then, he extends this logic to the case of humans.\nDifferent arts are meant for satisfying our natural needs in ways appropriate to\nour nature – both in quantity and quality. Afterwards, he  establishes that the\npurposes  of acquisitive art s are natural  when they   are grounded  in the\nessence of human communities ( e.g. the family or the  city ) just as the\nnatural needs of a given animal determines the nature of its feeding habits.\n[127]  Then, in the 9th chapter, he contrasts these natural arts of acquisition\nwith the unnatural arts of acquiring riches for the sake of  accumulating\nwealth. The reason why this second kind of acquisitive art is unnatural is that\nits purpose is not borrowed from nature. Aristotle later implies that such arts,\nwhose ends are arbitrary, are not genuine  instances of the acquisitive arts\nwhen he says about their natural counterpart that “These are the divisions of\nthe true or proper art  of wealth-getting and come first.”   ( Pol. I 9 1158\nb20) [128]   The second class of acquisitive arts are not ‘true or proper’\nbecause they are not grounded in nature. The following passage clearly indicates\nthat Aristotle considers them to be arts only by name because their purposes,\nnot being grounded in natural ones, are in a sense not ‘true purposes’ :\n\nOthers [129]  maintain that coined money is a mere sham, a thing not natural,\nbut conventional only, because, if the users substitute another commodity for\nit, it is worthless, and because it is not useful as a means to any of the\nnecessities of life, and, indeed, he who is rich in coin may often be in want of\nnecessary food.

The coin’s value, on the other hand, is not\nrooted in any real natural need, its value is merely conventional. Coins qua\ncoin do not contribute to the actualization of our nature. By telling us that\ncoins are not true riches because they do not provide us with the necessities\nfor living a human life, Aristotle is implying that we cannot arbitrarily decide\nthat something has value and purposefully pursue it. In other words, he is here\nrestating the necessity for the purposes of arts to be rooted in the nature of\nspecific substances.

As a result, he\ngrounds the distinction between natural and violent use in a value judgment with\nno genuine ontological basis. In short, an art is natural, or as he says\n‘justifiable’ if practiced for the sake of  fulfilling a genuine need. Thus\naccording to him, we can distinguish between natural and violent\ninstrumentalization processes simply by examining the disposition  of the agent\ni.e.  without considering the nature of the goal. [134]  Because all\ninstrumentalization processes are equally arbitrary on his account, there is no\ngenuine difference between the products of natural and violent crafts; a house\nhas no more being or unity than does a vistemboir . This is why he thinks we\nmust look to the intentions of the artist in order to establish the status of\nproductive arts. We, by contrast, have been arguing that the distinction is\nprimarily grounded in the nature of the end, and only secondarily in the\ndisposition of the artist.

The art of housebuilding\nfor instance, is natural because houses are in virtue of what they are  related\nto human nature. The end of the building craft (the completed house) is\nessentially related to man for it allows him to actualize his nature fully by\nproviding shelter.  Yet of course, the relation is not strictly intrinsic,\nbecause the house and the builder are distinct entities; thus we suggest that\ntheir relation is best described as quasi-extrinsic. By contrast, there can be\nno such relation between agent and patient in violent arts because unnatural\nends lack substantiality; they are like aggregates in that, although they may\nappear to be unified, they in fact are not ‘something’ but rather ‘some things’.\nIn the case of the vistemboir , there can be no essential relation between the\n‘artist’ and its ‘product’ for the simple reason that the latter has no essence,\nthus their relation is necessarily strictly  extrinsic. This raises a question,\nfor if (natural) artifacts can be essentially related to natural substances,\nthen they must have an essence, at least in some limited sense.   W e know\nAristotle is cautious about attributing the status of substance to artifacts,\nand according to some, this is because he does not think that the products of\ncrafts have a nature. Johnson, for instance, says that artifacts can only be\nsaid to have a nature in the limited sense that they inherit properties which\nbelong to their material constituents. [136]  In other words, on his account\nartifacts have no nature qua whole, which in turn means that they are no more\nthan the sum of their parts, and, as Johnson puts it :\n\nA ll functions of artifacts are ultimately incidental. That is why it is\npossible to construct for any artifact incidental functions that have an\nequivalent explanatory status to any purported ‘essential’ function they might\nhave. For example, a chair can be used to prop open the door, or a pencil to\nscratch my ear. [137]\n\n\n\nJohnson thinks the functions we attribute to artifacts are equally incidental\nbecause, as we have said, he does not consider that they have a nature. He is\nright, of course, that artifacts do not have a nature in the fullest sense i.e.\n they do not have an intrinsic principle of motion and rest - except in a\nderivative way, insofar as their constitutive elements possess such a nature\n[138]  - but we contend that they do, qua artifact, have more than a shape,\nwhich means that they are not mere aggregates.

( Metaph.  VII 17, 1041\nb11-17) [139]\n\n\n\nIn this passage, Aristotle presents what is sometimes called a ‘top down’ view\nof composition, where the compound (the whole) is something more than the sum of\nits parts. He then  goes on to establish that this something  is not an element\n(1041 b25-20) but rather “a cause in fact of this being flesh and this being a\nsyllable” [140]   – i.e. a formal principle. [141]  The contrast between such a\nprinciple and a mere shape is suggested by the very first line of the passage,\n[142]  where he distinguishes composite wholes  and heaps. A whole, Aristotle\nsays, is composed in such a way that the totality is one , whereas a heap, it is\nimplied, is a plurality. A heap is nothing other than its constitutive elements\nbecause it lacks a formal principle which would make it this or that . Because\nit has a shape, a heap may appear  unified but in truth, Aristotle thinks it\ndoes not, qua heap, have being or unity. A heap is not a genuine whole because\ncomposition (and unity) is the result of an organizing (formal) principle. The\nshape of a heap is not a cause of the arrangement of the elements, on the\ncontrary, it is a result  of the respective motions of its “parts”. Thus the\narrangement of heaps is a case of so-called bottom up composition, which\nAristotle does not consider to be genuine composition i.e.  to result in being\nand unity. This being said, while we agree with Johnson that Aristotle does not\nconsider artifacts to have a nature in the fullest sense of the term, we want to\nargue that the status of artifacts constitutes a middle ground between genuine\nsubstances and mere heaps. We contend that we must adopt this view, first ,\nbecause treating artifacts as mere heaps undermines  the distinction between\nnatural and violent arts, but also because it is strongly suggested by textual\nevidence. In the passage from Metaphysics  VII 17 which we were just examining,\nfor instance,  Aristotle relies on examples taken from both craft and nature:",

And\nwhy is this individual thing, or this body in this state, a man? Therefore what\nwe seek is the cause, i.e. the form, by reason of which the matter is some\ndefinite thing; and this is the substance of the thing.  ( Metaph . VII 17, 1041\nb5-7) [143]\n\n\n\nThis suggests that a house is indeed something , and not just some things i.e.\n it has a formal principle which grounds its being and unity as a whole. It may\nbe added that the way in which Aristotle speaks of artifacts in different\ncontexts also suggests that he does not consider them to be a mere superposition\nof their material constituents. Consider the case of the automata which\nAristotle invokes in the Generation of Animals. [144]  It is clear that\nAristotle considers it to have unity and being as a whole , for there is a\nspecific set of motions that belongs to the machine because of the way in which\nits parts are organized. Even in the case of simpler tools such as a saw, it is\nclear that it has capacities over and above those it inherits from its\nconstitutive elements. The hardness of the saw, and consequently its capacity to\ncut for instance, relies on, but is not completely explained by the nature of\niron, for if it was informed differently (say, if it was a ball, or a very thin\nsheet) iron may not exhibit these characters; thus we should say that it is the\ntool as a whole which possesses the hardness and the resulting capacity to cut\nin the specific way which serves the artisant’s  needs. [145]  It is clear,\ntherefore, that artifacts, like natural substances, exhibit some features which\nare due to their material constituents, and others which are due to their form.\nThis means that unlike heaps, artifacts do have a formal principle and\nconsequently have being and  unity qua artifact. Byrne [146]  rightly emphasizes\nthe similarity between Aristotle’s portrayal of the relation of material and\nformal principles in natural and artificial contexts; [147]  and argues that, if\nAristotle considered artifacts to be mere heaps (with a shape rather than a\nform) he would not rely on examples taken from craft to teach us about\ncomposition. Indeed the constitution of heaps is, as we have said, a case of\n‘bottom-up’ composition which results in the mere appearance of being and unity.\n In short, Aristotle’s use of craft analogies in this context is yet another\nindication that Aristotle indeed considers artifacts to be more than aggregates.",

In other words,\nif we are to maintain that artifacts have more than a shape, we must clarify why\nAristotle is cautious about calling them substances. In short, we will argue\nthat the reason why Aristotle denies them the status of substance is not that\nartifacts have no essence, but rather that their essence is somehow incomplete,\nand constitute some sort of middle ground between natural forms and mere shapes.\nThis, we contend, is what is suggested by the passages which Johnson cites [148]\n in discussing the status of artifacts. The context of these passages [149]  is\na concern with the question of which entities – if any – may be said to exist\nseparately ( auto kath auto ). Aristotle’s answer is that although it is hard to\ndeny with certainty the possibility that some natural forms may exist\nseparately, we can definitely rule out this possibility in the case of\nartificial forms because they lack substantiality; [150]   thus  if they can be\nsaid to have a nature, it is a derived or secondary kind of nature, which is not\nself-sufficient and remains defined in relation to natural substances. The other\nside of this coin is that natural forms ‘ are ’ in a fuller sense. This suggests\na gradation in the being and unity of different entities, with, on one end of\nthe spectrum, heaps (whose shape grants them the mere appearance  of being and\nunity) and on the other end, natural substances (whose form is a principle of\nthe kind of being and unity which makes them substances – and as a result,\npossible candidates for separate existence). We suggest that artifacts fall\nsomewhere between those extremes because their formal principle causes being and\nunity in an incomplete way. The form of bodily organs should also occupy a\nmiddle position on this spectrum, for it would be a mistake to treat organs as\nmere heaps, surely they have some degree of integrity and to some extent they\ncan be said to have an essence on the basis of which we can differentiate them\nand their respective functions, yet their form is not complete and does not make\nthem into an autonomous self-subsisting whole. The  way in which the form of\ninternal organs and external tools relate to the formal principle of natural\nsubstances is surely different, and we shall discuss this in more detail in our\nnext chapter when we turn to natural instrumental relations. For now let us\nfocus on distinguishing natural and artificial formal principles",

Beyond this\nlogical subordination, Aristotle suggests that artificial forms are\n‘existentially’ dependent upon natural substances because they lack something of\nthe actuality of natural forms. Consider for instance the following passage from\nDe Motu which compares natural and artificial principles:\n\nThe movements of animals can be compared with those of automatic puppets, which\nare set going on the occasion of a tiny movement (the strings are released, and\nthe pegs strike again one another); or with the toy wagon (for the child mounts\non it and moves it straight forward, and yet it is moved in a circle owing to\nits wheels being of unequal diameter – the smaller acts like a center on the\nsame principle as cylinders.) Animals have parts of a similar kind, their\norgans, the sinewy tendons to wit and the bones; the bones are like the pegs and\nthe iron; the tendons are like the strings; for when these are slackened or\nreleased movement begins. However, in the puppets and the toy wagon there is no\nchange of quality since if the inner wheels became smaller and greater by turns\nthere would be the same circular movement set up.

      "pageContent": "Before we move on to the next chapter, let us provide a summary of the main\npoints discussed thus far. The purpose of this chapter was to clarify how\nAristotle’s emphasis on nature as a cause should inform our understanding of\nartificial processes and their place within the scope of teleology. We have said\nthat Aristotle considers nature to be an inner   principle of motion, and that\nthings which are naturally constituted are moved towards their end by an\nintrinsic cause. We said that this should not be understood merely in a physical\nsense , as the intrinsic character of final causes is due to their identity with\nthe formal cause of the substance undergoing the change. Thus natural\nteleological accounts constitute explanations of how substances are moved\ntowards their end, which is their state of completion “For those things are\nnatural which, by a continuous movement originated from an internal principle,\narrive at some completion” ( Ph.  II 8, 199 b15). [156]  This state of\ncompletion constitutes both their formal and final cause because the form, given\nits essential identity with the   final cause, acts   as   the end of the\ncontinuous movement. Consequently, we have argued that teleological explanations\nare rooted in the nature of specific beings, and that  purposes should be\nunderstood ontologically, not psychologically. We have shown that this is so\neven in the case of the arts on Aristotle’s account. We have said, for instance,\nthat health (which is not an arbitrary goal, but a pre-existing end which is\ndetermined by the nature of the human organism) is the telos  of the medical art\nwhether a particular doctor desires to produce it or not. Thus purposiveness as\nit is found in the arts is either an imitation, or a completion of a specific\nnatural self-actualization process. [157]   We have said that i n completing and\nimitating nature, the goal of the artist is determined by, and cannot be\nunderstood apart from natural ends.   Through these considerations, we have\noffered an alternative to the dichotomous view of nature and the arts defended\nby Johnson and others. We have highlighted the subordination of artificial\ngoal-directedness to natural teleology, and consequently have shown them to be\nintimately related. [158]   We have also provided an alternative to a common\nview of Aristotle’s objection to his predecessor’s teleological principles\nwhich, we have said, does not lie in the fact that they established an analogy\nbetween natural and artificial goal-directedness. Rather, we argued his\nobjection has to do with their inversion of the order of priority between the\ntwo, which in turn results in a failure to identify the explanatory cause of\ngoal-directedness and to provide scientific accounts of teleological change.\nFinally , we have said that recognizing the secondary place of artificial\ngoal-directedness does not undermine the value of craft analogies, but in fact\nmakes these analogies all the more enlightening, both when it comes to",

We have challenged the first (a) claim above and shall now turn our\nattention to the realm of natural change, and attempt to provide an alternative\nto (b) the narrowly internalist perspective. [159]  In short, we will show that\nAristotle’s view of natural change extends to some  instrumental relations, thus\nfurther developing our thesis that there does exist a middle-ground between\nself-actualiz ation and arbitrary use. We have said that Johnson’s strictly\nintrinsic  view of natural change rests on the premise that the internal,\nintrinsic and explanatory characters of natural causes are equivalent. Simply,\nhis view presupposes that if a cause is not internal, it is unnatural and\nscientifically irrelevant. As a result, he must deny the possibility of natural\ninstrumental relations [160]  because of the agent-patient differentiation they\nentail. Thus he establishes a sharp contrast between natural self-actualization\n(which is for the sake of an intrinsic end ) and artificial instrumentalization\n(which is for the sake of  an extrinsic end) ; and claims that Aristotelian\nteleology is exclusively concerned with the former.   In this view, a substance\neither naturally strives for its intrinsic telos , or it is artificially (which\nis the same as to say arbitrarily) assigned an extrinsic and incidental end.\n[161]",

[163]   This is because the telos  of the body does  not belong\nto the elements intrinsically, and therefore if they retain their nature,\nJohnson thinks their contribution to the self-actualization of the body requires\nan extrinsic (thus artificial and incidental) teleological account. Once again,\nwe will argue that Johnson’s position is limited rather than wrong. He is right\nthat, fundamentally, Aristotle’s view of natural change must be understood in\nterms of the self-actualization of a specific nature; and to insist that the\nexplanatory cause of natural change cannot be extrinsic on Aristotle’s account.\nThe mistake, we will argue, is to conclude that all instrumental relations are\ntherefore unnatural and scientifically irrelevant. In short, we will argue that\nJohnson's view is too narrow because it ignores the possibility that some\nnatural relations are neither straightforwardly intrinsic or extrinsic. Let us\ninsist that we will not be defending a view of Aristotelian teleology which\nextends to strictly extrinsic instrumental relations. Rather, our aim is to\nexpand our understanding of intrinsic teleology in order to encompass some\nprocesses which are typically excluded because they are thought to require\nextrinsic and artificial teleological explanations. In what follows, we will be\nconcerned with three main questions; (1) does the Aristotelian view of nature\ninclude some instrumentalization processes, if so (2) what is their  relation to\nself-actualization processes, and (3) are they teleologically explicable?",

In these and similar cases, a natural\nsubstance instrumentalizes  another, not for the sake of  realizing an arbitrary\nfantasy, but in order to actualize its nature. This undermines the strictly\ninternalist view of nature because it means that at least some natural\nsubstances cannot actualize their nature ‘on their own’. [166]   The fact that\nwe find accounts of instrumental relations in Aristotle’s biological works\nsuggests that he considered that the externality entailed by such relations can\nbe reconciled with the internality which characterizes natural change. However,\nit remains for us to clarify the nature of this reconciliation. We have briefly\naddressed this topic in the introduction, [167]  but will now provide a more\ncomprehensive analysis and address some questions raised by our preliminary\nanswer.\n\nFirst, it will be useful to delineate the scope of our present inquiry. Some of\nthe instrumentalization processes identified  by the scholars  mentioned above\n raise questions regarding relations at higher levels of organization ( e.g. wi\nthin households, cities, animal communities, etc.) While these questions are\nworthy of consideration, given the purpose of the present chapter, it will be\nsufficient to restrict our attention to cases of instrumentalization involved in\nthe functioning of middle-sized organisms  such as plants and animals. [168]\n The following investigation will be centered on the relation between natural\nsubstances and their constitutive elements. We will argue that part-whole\nrelations within natural substances are not always strictly intrinsic on\nAristotle’s account, and that consequently, his view of natural change does in\nfact involve instrumentalization.\n\n\n\n\nTHE APORIA",

Functional parts are quasi-substances such as tissues and organs, whose\nformal and final principles are completely defined in relation to the whole they\nconstitute, whereas compositional parts are substances in their own right (e.g.\nthe material elements which constitute the tissues and organs), which can be\ndefined (and exist) apart from the whole they constitute. The homonymy\n principle [170]  thus applies to the former, but not the latter. The nature\n(formal and final cause) of functional parts is completely determined in\nrelation to that of the body, thus once the body loses its formal and final\ncause (through death), they can no longer perform their biological function and\nconsequently no longer ‘have a nature’; while they may still look the same\noutwardly, in truth they no longer are what it was for them to be a specific\nbody part. Compositional parts, on the other hand, are not defined in relation\nto the body they constitute, thus the homonymy principle does not apply to them,\nand they can survive the death of the organism. The water which constitutes eye\ntissues, for instance, does not cease to be water at the death of an animal.\n[171]",

Some scholars adopt a strictly intrinsic view of\nthis relation and claim that constitutive elements, like tissues and organs, are\ncompletely defined by the formal cause of the organism they constitute. As a\nresult, they undermine the distinction between functional and compositional\nparts. Others emphasize the distinction and defend a strictly extrinsic view\nwhich takes compositional matter to be a distinct substance which is ‘used’ by\nthe body in a similar fashion to how external objects are used. The surprising\ndiversity of approaches to this issue is born from a tension, inherent to the\nAristotelian view of substance, between the composite and individual nature of\nhylomorphic substances. [172]  It is generally agreed that the resolution of\nthis difficulty lies in appealing to the notions of actuality and potentiality\n which are developed in books VIII and IX of the Metaphysics . In short, the\nsolution is said to be that the elements which act as the material cause of\nnatural substances exist potentially . The controversy lies in how to understand\nthe potentiality ascribed to compositional matter. Are the elements which\ncompose tissues potential  in the sense that they no longer possess the\nsubstantial form which made them a ‘this’; or should we rather say that, insofar\nas they are part of a higher level structure, they are being prevented from\nfully actualizing their nature? For instance, is the water in the eye tissue\npotentially   water in the same way that earth is potentially water, namely in\nthe sense that, while it does not possess the substantial form of water, it\nremains the kind of thing which could  acquire it; or does it retain its\nsubstantial form ( i.e. remain water) and is called potential simply because it\nis being prevented from fully actualizing its nature? While it is beyond the\nscope of this paper to resolve the difficulty, we shall attempt a preliminary\ndelineation of the main solutions developed by scholars in order to situate our\nown perspective within the ongoing discussion of the issue. Three main ways to\napproach the difficulty are; (1) eliminativism; denying the status of substance\nto elements altogether, (2) neutralism; claiming that while the elements are\nsubstances when they exist in isolation, they lose that status upon becoming\npart of tissues because they are completely transformed (destroyed) as they gain\ntheir ‘new identity’ within the context of composition, and (3) dualism;\n maintaining that the elements are altered, but not destroyed in the process of",

[174]  While her approach is interesting in many respects,  it is\nlimited first in that it rests on a confusion of matter (a kind of being) and\nmaterial causes (a role played by determinate beings) [175]  and second , in\nthat it creates a tension with the way in which Aristotle speaks of the elements\nin other contexts. Indeed, the opening passage of VII 16 reads “earth and fire\nand air; for none of them is a unity, but as it were  a mere heap, till they are\nworked up and some unity is made of them” , [176]   thus  if Peterson is right\nthat, in this passage, Aristotle is teaching us about the ‘kind of being’ that\nthe elements are, then it contradicts the accounts we find in the treatises on\nMeteorology and Physics for instance, where the elements are by no means\npresented as mere heaps. In what follows, we will suggest that potentiality\nshould be understood as a relational property rather than an intrinsic character\nof material causes. If we adopt this view, Aristotle’s characterization of the\nelements in these different contexts entails no contradiction for the same\nreason that there is no contradiction involved in calling an object big and\nsmall, when considered from different perspectives. Simply, qua material\nprinciple (which is how they are treated in Metaph. VII 16), Aristotle considers\nthe elements to be akin to a heap in need to be unified, but qua  substance,\nthey are unified and goal-directed beings. Thus it appears that the two\nlimitations of Peterson’s perspective are intimately related, for the confusion\nof the relative indeterminacy of the elements qua  material cause with their\ninherent nature rests on the failure to distinguish properly between matter and\nmaterial causes.\n\n\n\n\nNEUTRALISM",

She insists on Aristotle’s approval of a greek way to\nspeak of objects and their material constituents, namely the practice “not to\ncall the product a ‘this’ (tode) with reference to the matter out of which it is\nmade, but a that-en’ ( ekeininon ) ” i.e.   not to call a box “wood” but\n“wooden”. From this she concludes that Aristotle thinks that wood does not\nsurvive the generation of a box; [182]  and that, while the production starts\nwith wood, which exists as a definite subject, once the box is crafted “the\noriginal wood, although it survives as a constituent, has become indefinite”.\n[183]  The mystery of her view lies in what it means for the wood to be such an\nindefinite subject; especially given the fact that its essential properties\ncontinue to be exhibited by the box. In short, Gill’s view is that the\nproperties survive, [184]   while the subject does not, although eventually, it\n(the material cause e.g. the wood) will be “recreated as a separately existing\nentity”. [185]  According to Gill, maintaining that the elements persist through\nthe generation of a higher-level compound leads to materialism. She presumes\nthat if the wood is present in the wooden box; then the box is nothing more than\nwood. [186]  However, we contend it is not necessary to deny the composite\nnature of substances in order to escape materialism; one only needs to assert\nthat the material constituents are not a sufficient explanation of the nature of\nthe higher substance. [187]  In fact, it is reasonable to suppose that the\npractice of calling a box ‘wooden’ rather than ‘wood’ simply indicates that the\nbox is considered to be something more than just wood. To say this, however, is\nnot the same as saying that the wood is not present in the box, and it is\nunclear why we should take Aristotle to make the latter – much more radical–\n claim. Gill herself [188]  recognizes the fact that the persistence of material\ncauses is evident to perception; and grants that, perhaps in the case of an\nartifact such as the wooden box, Aristotle would agree that the wood is still\npresent and identifiable even when it has become a box.",

[190]  He notes,\namongst other things, that her account of Aristotle’s solution to the problem of\nunity raised  in Metaphysics  VIII 6 [191]  – namely to deny definitional\nindependence to the constituents of hylomorphic substances – is unpersuasive for\nthe examples which Aristotle invokes in that context mostly do not involve\nfunctional matter (the central example under discussion in the passage being\nthat of the bronze sphere). Most significant for our present purpose, Loux notes\nthat Gill’s own account of the solution to what she calls the problem of\n‘horizontal unity’ [192]  is to posit an underlying substratum which persists\nthrough change. Thus, if she wants to maintain that the elements are potential\nin the sense that they will once again exist in actuality after the death of the\norganism, she must posit a substratum which persists through the destruction and\nre-generation of these elements. [193]  This substratum, Loux rightly notes, is\na distinct entity which composes the organic body and actually  persists\nthroughout its life. Thus she defers rather than overcomes the aporia of\nhylomorphic unity. [194]  \n\n\n\n\nTHE GREATEST DIFFICULTY\n\nThe most serious objection which faces the strictly  intrinsic view which\nunderlie the solution s explored above [195]  is that it undermines a key\npremise of hylomorphism. Aristotle insists on many occasions [196]  that the\nnature of a hylomorphic compound is not reducible to its form. Consider for\ninstance his discussion of this issue in Metaphysics VII 11; in this passage, he\nfirst identifies the definition with the formal principle, which he insists is\nnot the same as the concrete thing. [197]  He then explains that it is easier to\ndefine artifacts, for the distinction between the material and formal principles\nis made apparent by the fact that artificial forms can be instantiated in\ndifferent materials. By contrast, the form of man is always found in flesh and\nbones and so “we are unable to effect the severance ” ( Metaph . VII, 11\n1036b5). [198]  Aristotle  then establishes that, even if it is difficult for us\nto distinguish those principles, nonetheless they are distinct,  i.e.  the\nmaterial principle does contribute something to the compound, whose nature is\nnot exhausted by stating the formulable essence. [199]  Although the\ncontribution of the material cause to the nature of an artifact is more evident\nfor us, Aristotle is clear that in truth ( per se ) it is in natural substances\nthat the contribution of the material cause is most crucial:",

But the case is not similar; for an animal is something perceptible, and\nit is not possible to define it without reference to movement. ( Metaph . VII\n11, 1036 b25 -26) [200]\n\n\n\nIn other words, while it is easy to see what the bronze contributes to the\nbronze circle because it is less ‘tangled up with the form’, in truth, its\ncontribution to the compound is less ‘essential’ than that of the material\nprinciple of natural substances. This is why circles can be instantiated in\nsomething other than bronze (although not any  material will do, there are many\noptions) whereas “the form of man is always found in flesh and bones and parts\nof this kind” .  This suggests that Aristotle’s hylomorphic conception of\nsubstances entails that the nature of that which acts as the material cause is\npresupposed, [201]  not replaced or destroyed; and although this fact is easier\nto recognize in the case of artificial compounds, it holds a fortiori  in the\ncase  of natural  compounds. [202]  While the passage just examined focuses on\nfunctional parts (flesh and bone), Aristotle treats the contribution of\ncompositional matter in a similar manner. Chapters 4 to 7 of the fourth book of\nthe treatise on Meteorology , for instance, are devoted to the role played by\nthe elements in the composition of natural substances. Consider for instance the\nfollowing:\n\nThe moist  is what makes the dry determinable, and each serves as a sort of glue\nto the other – as Empedocles says in his poem on Nature, ‘ glueing   meal\n together by means of water’. Thus the determined body involves them both. (\nMete . IV 4, 381 b31) [203]  \n\n\n\nIn commenting on this  passage, Byrne notes that the respective characters of\nwater and earth are not only preserved, but contribute something necessary to\nthe bodies they constitute, for the very existence (and persistence) of\nwell-defined bodies depends on the right combination of these elements. [204]\n Such a view of the role played by the elements in the composition of natural\nbodies is significantly clearer if we suppose that their nature is preserved as\nthey become parts of substances at higher levels of organization.

      "pageContent": "THE INDEPENDENCE OF MATERIAL CAUSES\n\nAccordingly, Byrne argues that Aristotle’s account of the role played by\nmaterial causes entails that they preserve their integrity and independence,\nthus he challenges the traditional view which reduces material causes to ‘pure\npotentiality’. [206]  In order to explain and overcome this (mis)understanding\nof Aristotle’s perspective, Byrne first distinguishes between matter  (physical\nstuff) and material causes (that out of which something is made), and clarifies\nin what sense the latter can be called ‘potential’. [207]  He explains that\nmaterial causes are not ‘a kind of thing’ with definite properties, i.e.  being\na material cause does not   mean ‘being material’ in the sense of being\nsomething physical. Rather, being a material cause means standing in a certain\nrelation to something else; it “describes a job, rather than the thing that\nperforms that job.” [208]   Broadly speaking, something is a material cause if\nsomething else can be made from it. Byrne notes that Aristotle does not always\nresort to physical examples for illustrating the role of material causes. He\ngives, for instance, the example of the letters of the alphabet out of which\nsyllables are made. By contrast, to be something material (to be matter, or made\nof matter) means to have definite properties “to be matter  in the sense of\nphysical stuff is to possess certain intrinsic, non-relational properties, such\nas being extended, divisible, movable, and so forth.” [209]    \n\nHaving established this distinction, Byrne clarifies in what qualified  sense\nmaterial causes may be called potential . He argues that although matter has a\nnature, and is in no sense ‘pure potentiality’, [210]  material causes are\npotential   in one respect, namely in relation to  a compound. He insists,\nhowever, that in order to be able to play the role it is assigned, the material\ncause of a hylomorphic compound must have definite properties in its own right.\nIn other words, although it is potential in one respect , considered  in itself\nthe material cause must be something actual. For instance, although the bronze\nconsidered qua  material cause is potentially a statue, qua bronze it is\nactually something determinate. In fact, Byrne argues, it is precisely because\nit is actually bronze, that it can act as the material cause of the statue; to\nbe potentially  a statue means being actually  hard, malleable, and a series of\nother things.",

There can be no potentiality tout court  for Aristotle, because\nactuality is primary in multiple ways, two of which interest us presently.\nFirst, actuality is prior to potentiality ‘in formula’, for the nature of a\ngiven potentiality is determined by a corresponding state of actuality. To be\n‘capable’ (to be potential )  is always to be capable of something specific.\n[211]  Secondly , actuality is first in time; “For from the potentially existing\nthe actually existing is always produced by an actually existing thing, e.g. man\nfrom man” ( Metaph . IX 8, 1049b25). [212]  This holds not only in the case of\nthe agent which produces the change, but also for the patient:\n\nIs earth potentially a man? No– but rather when it has already become seed, and\nperhaps not even then. It is just as it is with being healed; not everything can\nbe healed by the medical art or by luck, but there is a certain kind of thing\nwhich is capable of it, and only this is potentially healthy. ( Metaph . IX 7,\n1049 a1-5) [213]  \n\n\n\nEarth is not potentially a man because it lacks certain determinations in order\nto be ‘the kind of thing’ which is capable of receiving the form of man “...\njust as earth is not yet potentially a statue (for it must first change in order\nto become brass).” ( Metaph . IX 7, 1049 a15) [214]   Thus, in order to talk\nabout a man existing potentially, both the formal and material principles must\nbe actual . The formal cause must exist actually  in another substance of the\nsame kind, and the material cause must actually  have the properties required to\nbe potentially  a man. Potentiality then, is limited and determined by actuality\n‘on both ends’ on Aristotle’s account, for to be potentially x  means a) being\nactually  something capable of embodying the form of x and b) being informed by\na substance which is actually x .",

If, for instance, water may no longer\nbe called water once it constitutes the body; if from that point on, ‘what it\nis’ is grounded in the formal principle of the body, water cannot be said to be\n‘the nature of the body’.

In his view, it is precisely because the elements\npersist through the generation of the tissue that the latter exhibits the\nintermediary properties that it does. [216]  The properties of clay, for\ninstance, are derived from the basic properties of the earth and water which\nconstitutes it, and the potentiality ascribed to both constituents follows from\n the fact that they are not existing separately, but in combination. [217]\n Byrne insists that Aristotle conceives of combination as a middle ground\nbetween simple aggregation (a process in which elements are simply superposed,\nnot changed in a significant way) and transmutation (a process in which the\nelements lose their substantial form). [218]  The benefit of his view is that it\noffers clarity on how the elements can contribute in specific ways to the nature\nof the compound. The difficulty lies in grounding the unity of composite\nsubstances. On Byrne’s account, there is no fundamental difference between the\nrelation of formal and material principles in natural substances and artifacts.\n[219]  In his view, the material cause of a natural body is just as independent\nas that of an artifact; with the only difference that “the formal causes of\nnatural substances impose greater demands on their material causes.”   [220]\n The unity of natural substances only differs from that of artifacts in that the\nformal principle makes “greater demands”   on the material principle, because\nunlike artificial forms, natural forms have to be instantiated in very precise\nmaterials, and the specific requirements apply at many levels of composition.\n[221]   The issue is that it is unclear why the mere fact that natural forms\nmake ‘greater demands’ on their material cause can, in and of itself, ground the\nclaim that natural substances are more unified than artifacts. For one thing, it\nis conceivable that a special kind of artifact could only be instantiated in\nmaterials with very precise composition; nevertheless, we would want to say that\nsuch an object does not exhibit the same kind of unity as does a natural\nsubstance.

This second difficulty is\nmore delicate and an adequate answer would demand an exhaustive discussion of\nthe middle books of the Metaphysics . While it is beyond the scope of this paper\nto provide such an answer, we may say this much in order to overcome the\napparent tension; first , we may note that both passages concern a specific view\nof composition; and do not necessarily apply to all conceivable ways for\nsubstances to enter into a compositional relation. The argument in VII 16 is\ndirected at the Platonists, and concerns the possibility for substances to be\ncomposed of substances that are   actual  in the same respect  (e.g. for the\nhorse itself to be the substance of particular horses). Consequently, we suggest\nthat the conclusion of the passage should be understood in the restricted sense\nthat two substances existing at the same level of organization cannot be in a\ncompositional relation. In line with this, let us recall Peterson’s insight\nconcerning the polysemy of the notions of being and unity. Peterson suggested\nthat unity and multiplicity are only in tension if attributed to the same thing\nin the same respect .

We have said that Aristotle, when he describes nature as an\ninner principle of motion, does not only   mean a physical kind of internality,\nthus we should not understand him to mean ‘if the craft was physically in the\nwood’. In fact, let us notice that he does not say ‘if the craftsman was in the\nwood’. We can easily imagine what it would mean for the craftsman (the efficient\ncause) to be physically in the wood, but what does it mean for the craft to be\nin the wood? It is plausible to think that it means something like this: ‘if the\nnature of the craft and that of the wood were more intimately related’, i.e. if\nthe boat and its formal principle were  one , as a living body and its soul are\none.  This is the answer suggested by an analogous thought experiment found in\nbook II of De Anima:\n\nThe soul is a substance in accord with the account. And this is the essence of\nthis sort of body. It is just like this: if an instrument – for example, an axe\n – were a natural body, its substance would be the being for the axe , and this\nwould be its soul. ( De An . II 1, 412 b12-14) [228]  \n\n\n\nIt follows that, in natural instrumentalization processes, there is a sense in\nwhich agent and patient, although differentiated in some respect, are\nnonetheless one . Let us invoke once again the passage of the treatise on\nRespiration  where Aristotle contrasts the way in which craft and nature use\n fire: “ while the crafts use the fire merely as an instrument, nature uses it\nas a material as well”  ( Resp.  485 a30-b5). [229]  Although he does not\nelaborate on what this distinction entails, what he says afterwards suggests\nthat he means to say that the natural use of  fire involves a certain ‘fusion’\n(combination)  with the natural body ;",

( Resp . 485 b11-16 ) [230]\n\n\n\nThis suggests that the distinction between use ‘as instrument’ and use ‘as\nmaterial’ is that in the first case, agent and patient remain distinct whereas\nin the second, the agent ‘assimilates’ [231]  the patient, and as a result   “\nthere is some sense in referring to the same agent” .   Thus , when a natural\nsubstance uses fire as material , although agent and patient can be\ndifferentiated in some respects, there is also a sense in which they are the\nsame. This, we suggest, means that the formal, final and efficient causes of the\nnatural substance (its soul) should not be called the extrinsic, nor even the\nquasi-extrinsic cause of the changes it imparts in fire. We suggest that in such\na case, the relation of agent and patient is best described as quasi-intrinsic.\nTo clarify what this means, it may be useful to consider the way in which\nindividual humans are said to be parts of a family; there is a sense in which\nthe individual members are  the family – the family is not a distinct substance\nexisting besides its members – and for this reason, the relation of the\nindividual members to the family cannot be strictly extrinsic; yet they remain\nindividuals with an integrity, a nature, a purpose of their own, thus their\nrelation to the whole cannot be strictly intrinsic either.\n\nSimply, we suggest that, although compositional parts have a certain level of\nindependence, within the context of composition they do not exist as an entirely\ndistinct entity. This is because the fusion and integration of materials in\nnatural instrumentalization makes them an integral part of the natural\nsubstance. As a result, we can effectively distinguish between the way in which\nan artisant   uses  materials and how a natural body uses  compositional matter;\nin art, the relationship between the materials and the artisant is\nquasi-extrinsic, as they remain separate entities, while in nature, the relation\nis quasi-intrinsic, because the agent and patient are somewhat interwoven, in a\nsense becoming one and the same.\n\n\n\n\nEXTRINSIC ENDS",

The issue is that, for instance, if the water which constitutes the\neye tissues remains a distinct substance with its own formal and final\nprinciple, its contribution to sight is incidental to it, and a teleological\naccount of its contribution to such an extrinsic and incidental end would be as\nscientifically irrelevant as an account of the motion of a horse which is being\nmoved by a truck for the sake of  a human end. [233]\n\nThis difficulty – namely how the telos  of the whole can explain something about\nthe changes which occur in its compositional parts – echoes an ongoing\ndiscussion within the scholarship concerning the explanatory value of\nhypothetical necessity. While Johnson and like-minded scholars avoid the\ndifficulty by denying the independence of compositional parts i.e.  treating\n them as functional parts; others emphasize the contrast between functional and\ncompositional parts and treat the latter as completely distinct substances whose\nrelation to the whole is strictly extrinsic. As a result, they must diminish or\neven deny the explanatory value of hypothetical necessity. Byrne, for instance,\ninsists that it would be a mistake to explain the essential characters of the\nelements by appealing to the nature of the whole they constitute. [234]  He\nnotes that while it is hypothetically necessary for eyes to be made out of\nsomething transparent, it is problematic to explain the transparency of water\nwith respect to the nature of the eye; for one thing, water can constitute many\nother hylomorphic compounds or even exist on its own; and in all these cases, it\nis transparent. In order to avoid the mistake of explaining everything  about\ncompositional matter with reference to the nature of the composite, he\nemphasizes the former’s independence and deprives hypothetical  necessity of\nexplanatory power. On his account, hypothetical necessity does not express a\nreal causal dependance of the matter on the formal and final causes that are\nbeing embodied; it is rather a description of the kind of material and efficient\ncauses which are required to produce a good result non-accidentally. In this\nview, “final causes are effects, not causes” . [235]   Although we share the\nconcern regarding excessively broad teleological accounts which rob\ncompositional matter of its integrity, we consider this reduction of the scope\nof teleological accounts to be excessive and problematic.\n\n\n\n\n\nHYPOTHETICAL AND CONDITIONAL NECESSITY",

He distinguishes between\nnecessary conditions and hypothetical necessity i.e. between acting for the sake\nof , and merely contributing to  something. Simply while a number of conditions\ncontribute to the actualization of a given form, only those which actively\ncontribute to the process qua  ‘auxiliary cause’ (συναίτιον) [237]  are\nhypothetically necessary. This distinction allows him to maintain the\nexplanatory power of hypothetical necessity without making the nature of the\ncomposite whole responsible for explaining too much about the substances it\ninstrumentalizes . According to Stein, the tendency to undermine the explanatory\nvalue of hypothetical necessity arises from a failure to establish this\ndistinction. If one takes all the necessary conditions of realization of a given\ntelos  to be hypothetically necessary, then the scope of a single teleological\nexplanation becomes outrageously broad. Indeed, the necessary conditions for the\nrealization of any natural form   can ultimately be traced back all the way to\nthe very structure of the cosmos. [238]  Stein suggests that the relation of\nhypothetical necessity in fact expresses an explanatory relationship between the\nfinal and material principles of natural substances, and thus does not extend to\nall necessary conditions.

      "pageContent": "Part of his challenge to the common view ( the reduction of hypothetical\nnecessity to conditional necessity [240] ) is to deny that hypothetical\nnecessity expresses a temporal  relation of priority. In his view, the temporal\nseparation of the explanans and explanandum, although it is frequent, is not a\nrequirement for the relation of hypothetical necessity to hold. He rightly notes\nthat the teleological relation holds not only in the generation process, but\nalso as the organism maintains its form and actively exercises its natural\nfunctions. [241]  In other words, he argues the relationship between the telos\n and the material properties is a synchronic one. Accordingly, he suggests that\nthe contrast with the kind of necessity which belongs to mathematics should not\nbe understood temporally,  i.e.  it is not a contrast between a hypothetical\nrelation that starts with ‘what is’, and one that starts with ‘what will be’.\nThe real contrast, he argues, has to be understood in terms of the nature of\npart-whole relations, for in mathematics, the inference is from the definition\nof simpler components, such as the nature of a straight line, to a necessary\nconclusion regarding a more complex object constructed from them, such as a\ntriangle. By contrast, hypothetical necessity starts with the definition of the\ncomplete and mature being, and infers something about its constitutive elements.\n[242]  Stein insists that what is being hypothesized is not the temporal\nrealization of a given nature, but rather the essence. In the case of eye\nformation; it is not the generation of an eye at a given moment in time, but the\nnature of eyes which is hypothesized. Therefore, it is misleading to emphasize\nthe temporal dimension and describe the relation, as we often do, by saying that\nif an eye is to come into existence , then it must be made out of water.\nInstead, we should say that if this is the nature of the eye , then it must be\nmade out of water. The second formulation makes it clear that the material\ncomposition of the eye is explained by its nature, whereas the first formulation\nmakes it seem as if a future event in some way dictates the use of materials.\n[243]   It is clear, on Stein’s account, that  the nature of the good result\nwhich is hypothesized, although temporally last, can have explanatory power.\n[244]  By contrast, the usual way of viewing the ‘hypothesis’, makes it hard to\nsee in what sense it could be explanatory, for the temporal realization of a\ngiven nature is indeed an effect rather than a cause.",

His view provides us with a clear way to distinguish hypothetical\nnecessities (auxiliary causes) from mere conditions of possibility. In short,\nsomething is hypothetically necessary when it is constitutive of a given\ncapacity e.g . being hard is more than a ‘necessary condition’ of cutting, it is\nan integral part of the cutting capacity. [246]   This distinction in turn\nprovides us with the means to distinguish between a ‘result’ and an end.

Stepping in something watery is\na necessary condition of wet feet, yet the bird’s wet feet are simply the result\n of a given set of conditions, this state of affairs is not an ‘end’. Although\nit is true that if the bird is to have wet feet, then  he must step in water, it\nis incorrect to say that the bird’s wet feet have explanatory power, and that it\n‘hypothetically necessitates’ stepping in water.

We\nhave said that, while Byrne convincingly argues for the independence of\ncompositional matter, his view raises questions regarding the status of the\nexplanatory relation which holds between a natural substance and its\nconstitutive elements. Because Byrne views their relation as extrinsic, he must\ndescribe the latter’s contribution to the self-actualization of the former in\nterms of necessary conditions. In this view, the essence of a natural substance\npresupposes  but does not explain anything about the elements which constitute\nit. [249]     We have relied on Stein’s account of hypothetical necessity in\norder to outline a more nuanced approach that does justice both to the relative\nindependence of compositional parts and to the explanatory relation between them\nand the natural substances they constitute.  Although he does not use this\nlanguage, Stein’s account presupposes a quasi-intrinsic view of the relation\nwhich holds between a whole and its compositional parts. His account does\njustice to the distinction between use as tool  and use as material  (between\nnatural and artificial instrumentalization)   and consequently provides the\n means for distinguishing instrumentalization processes that are scientifically\nrelevant from those that are not. We can say for instance, that the water\npresent in the eye is more than a tool which can be ‘used’ by the eye for the\nsake of seeing in a comparable manner to the way eyeglasses are used ; for\n water (its ability to transmit light) is constitutive of the being   of eyes .\nThus we can differentiate between the contribution of eyeglasses, and that of\nthe water to the realization of sight; the latter being hypothetically\nnecessary, thus teleologically explicable, the former being a mere condition of\npossibility, and not relevant to a scientific account of the functioning of\neyes. This can help us to clarify the place of instrumentalization processes\nwithin a view of teleology which is primarily intrinsic. By excluding conditions\nof possibility from the scope of teleological explanations, we ensure that\naccounts of instrumentalization processes are rooted in the self-actualization\nof specific natural substances. The upshot is that teleological accounts of the\nnatural development or functioning of substances can indeed include some\ninstrumental relations in the restricted cases  where user and used, although\ndifferentiated in some respect, are nonetheless one,   i.e.  in cases where the\ncontribution to the self-actualization of a natural substance is hypothetically\n(not merely conditionally) necessary.

Our contribution\nrepresents an initial step in the development of an interpretation of\nAristotle’s teleology which, although it differs fundamentally from artificial\nand extrinsic views, also avoids confining its scope to strictly intrinsic and\nnatural self-actualization processes. In short, we have argued that Aristotle\nconsiders the self-actualization of natural substances to be the focal point\nrather than the exclusive subject of teleological accounts. Our first chapter\nhas argued that artificial goal-directedness should not be viewed in opposition\nto, but rather understood in light of natural teleology; and our second chapter\nhas established that natural instrumentalization processes have their place\nwithin the scope of Aristotelian teleology because they are constitutive of the\nbeing/becoming of specific substances. Through this, we have challenged the\nassumption that there exists no middle ground between self-actualization and\narbitrary instrumentalization. By developing a perspective which overcomes this\ndichotomy, we have been able to avoid the excessive narrowing of scope which we\nfind problematic in Johnson’s and like-minded scholars’ perspective. We have\nbeen careful to show that the twofold expansion of the teleological horizon that\nwe advocate does not entail an appeal to unnatural and extrinsic schemes of\nexplanation. In other words, our perspective does not entail an open-ended\nextension of the scope of teleology, for the inclusion of instrumentalization\nprocesses is grounded in their relation to a specific se lf-actualization\nprocess.

This is because ‘natural’ and ‘intrinsic’ are thought\nto have a single meaning. In this view, a motion or change is either natural in\nthe strict sense that it results from an intrinsic principle of motion, or it is\nunnatural and scientifically irrelevant – the result of an extrinsic and\nincidental cause. By contrast, the broader view which we defend entails that\ndifferent kinds of motions and changes can be classified according to the sense\nin which they are natural and intrinsic, for both these notions are polysemous.\nFor instance, while the growth of an organism is natural in the fullest sense,\n natural arts are ‘more natural’ than their violent counterparts because of\ntheir subordination to natural goal-directedness. The instrumentalization of\ncompositional matter by a living organism is even more natural than ‘natural’\nartificial processes, for in addition to being subordinated to natural\ngoal-directedness, there is a sense in which it is caused by an inner principle\nof motion ( e.g.  in the case of tissue formation, the motion of water qua  part\nof the body, is self-caused - for there is a sense in which the water is  the\nbody which moves it). Thus in our view, there is no such thing as the notion of\n‘intrinsic’ or ‘natural’ tout court , although we can speak of a change being\n‘intrinsic’ or ‘natural’ most of all . In short, these notions apply primarily\nto the self-actualization of substances, but can be said  in different (derived)\nways in other cases. [252]  \n\nSimply, viewing the self-actualization of natural substances as the focal point\nof Aristotelian teleology provides an ontological basis which allows us to\ndiscriminate and classify other types of motions and changes. We may gain\nclarity on what this means by invoking the semantic analogy which Plato develops\nin his discussion of composition in the Sophist. [253]  In short, the analogy\nestablishes a relation between structure and meaning on the one hand, and\nstructure and being on the other. The way in which structure (syntax) produces\nmeaning (semantics) is compared to the way in which formal principles cause\nbeing. This is contrasted with mere addition or superposition which results in\nmeaningless strings of words, and heaps with no genuine being. Expanding on the\nanalogy, we may compare the way in which different subordinate entities derive\nmeaning/being from their relation to sentences and substances respectively (\ni.e. their relation to that which has meaning/being in the primary sense):\n\nMeaning\n\nBeing\n\nSentence\n\nSubstance\n\nParts of speech (verbs, nouns, etc.)\n\nFunctional parts (e.g. organs)\n\nSentence complement\n\nCrafts (e.g. housebuilding)\n\nModifiers\n\nArtifacts (e.g. eyeglasses)",

      "pageContent": "THE TASK AHEAD\n\nIn our introduction, we outlined four stages essential to the development of a\ncomprehensive view of Aristotle’s intrinsic teleology, and set out to undertake\nthe first. We shall now conclude by reflecting on the incidence of our work in\nshaping our approach to the forthcoming phase. The next step, let us recall,\nshould  be to determine whether the scope of Aristotelian teleology is\nrestricted to the internal functioning of organisms. [254]  The issue is often\nformulated in a way which suggests an alternative between strictly local and\nstrong global teleological perspectives, i.e.  the question is whether natural\nsubstances are directed towards a species-specific intrinsic end, or exist and\nact primarily for the sake of some uniform and extrinsic purpose ( e.g .\npleasing God or serving humanity). An important limitation of Johnson’s approach\nto this difficulty is that he accepts the question as formulated by those who\nhold extrinsic and artificial views of the teleological organization of nature.\nMore precisely, he accepts the premise that the interdependence of natural\nsubstances can be explained teleologically only if we posit an extrinsic\norganizer whose intentions explain the functional arrangement of nature beyond\nthe level of middle-sized organisms. [255]  This is because he thinks\ninstrumentalization belongs to the domain of (arbitrary) intentions and is\ndivorced from natural goal-directedness. By contrast, the perspective we have\ndeveloped, because it emphasizes the ontological basis of goal-directed\ninstrumentalization processes, can help to frame the question in a more fruitful\nway. Having established that all teleological accounts, even instrumental ones,\nmust be understood in relation to the development of a specific nature or form,\nthe question becomes an ontological one, namely whether there are beings at\nhigher levels of organization i.e. whether nature is organized functionally into\nwholes  which have a nature (genuine being and unity [256] ) beyond the level of\nmiddle-sized  substances. If we take for instance the notorious question of the\ninstrumental role of rain in plant growth, instead of asking whether the rain\ncycle exists directly and exclusively for the sake of plants, the question\nbecomes whether rain and plants are parts of a functional whole whose nature\naccounts for their mutually beneficial relations. [257]  This way of formulating\nthe question in no way suggests that rain, if it plays an instrumental role in\nthe development of some other nature or form, is devoid of intrinsic value or\ninclination to realize its own nature, any more than the functional organization\nof elements into organic tissues entails that the former exist exclusively for\nthe latter’s sake.

Thus it constitutes a middle ground between the strong\nglobal perspective which affirms the uniformity of natural purposes, and the\nindividualistic view which emphasizes their diversity. If this is Aristotle’s\nperspective as we hope to demonstrate, it presents an exciting opportunity for a\nmeaningful engagement with the different branches of ecology, as it entails that\nindividual organisms can be studied not only in isolation, but also as parts of\na goal-directed wholes  which exists at higher levels of organization.\n\n\n\n\nNATURE BEYOND ORGANISMS",

[261]  Aristotle’s silence on this question has led\nmany to the conclusion that he was not interested in ecological studies, or even\nthat his views on nature are, by principle, incompatible with the\npresuppositions of ecology. [262]  A first thing worth noting – something which\neven advocates of the global interpretation often fail to acknowledge – is that\ngiven the subject matter of Aristotle’s biological treatises, [263]  we should\nnot expect him to discuss the functions of animals and plants in the\nhigher-level organization of the natural world, even if he did consider nature\nto be organized higher up, for the same reason that an anatomy textbook written\nby a biologist today would not include discussions of the ecological niche of\nthe organisms under analysis. In both cases, it is the nature of the inquiry\nwhich explains the omission rather than a principled opposition to ecology on\nthe part of the author. [264]  Thus we suggest it is a mistake to attempt to\nground an argument for the extension of teleology beyond living organisms in the\n– very few – “ecological remarks” found in the works on nature such as those\nwhich mention the location of the mouths of dolphins, [265]  or the relation of\nrain and crop growth. [266]  We contend that this is not the best avenue first\n because these passages are not meant to address this question [267]  and second\n because there are much more relevant texts in the Metaphysics , Nicomachean\nEthics, and most importantly in the Politics,  where Aristotle does provide\nteleological accounts of the functional organization of nature at higher levels\nof organization.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FAMILY EXISTS BY NATURE",

      "pageContent": "THE FAMILY EXISTS BY NATURE\n\nThe Politics  opens with the remark that “ Every state is a community of some\nkind, and every community is established with a view to some good” ( Pol. I 1,\n1252a1). [268]  The good, let us recall, is primarily ontological  for\nAristotle, and can be an object of intentions only secondarily; thus the notion\nthat a community exists for the sake of some good means something more than the\nfact that some people have come together because they desire to achieve a good\nresult. To call the community goal-directed entails that it has a nature. [269]\n In the first chapter of book I of the Politics , it is already apparent that\nAristotle considers the family and the state to have genuine being  and unity ,\ni.e.  to be something more than an aggregate of beings. [270]  The next few\nchapters, which examine the relation of individuals to these higher level\nentities, reinforce and clarify this. Aristotle’s discussion of the functional\nrole played by individual members of the family closely mirrors his views on\npart whole relations within the context of the composition of living organisms.\nHe explicitly establishes the priority of the state over both the family and the\nindividual , and makes the radical suggestion that the latter, if it exists\noutside the state, is a man only by name :\n\nThe state is by nature clearly prior to the family and to the individual, since\nthe whole is of necessity prior to the part; for example, if the whole body be\ndestroyed, there will be no foot or hand, except homonymously, as we might speak\nof a stone hand; for when destroyed the hand will be no better than that. (...)\nthe  proof that the state is a creation of nature and prior to the individual is\nthat the individual, when isolated, is not self sufficing ; and therefore he is\nlike a part in relation to the whole. But he who is unable to live in society,\nor who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast\nor a god; he is no part  of a state. ( Pol . I 2, 1253 a20-35) [271]",

[272]   The sense in which the function of individuals\nis determined by the end of the communities they constitute is specified\nthroughout the rest of the first book [273]  where the nature, function, and\nrelation of the individual members of the family are examined. The main elements\nto take away from this investigation are (1) that the parts of the family are\nspecifically differentiated in a way that reflects the differentiation of organs\nwithin a body.  There is no opposition between the respective ends of master and\nslave, or husband and wife on Aristotle’s account because of a shared\ndirectedness towards the end of the family which is primary, much like the end\nof an organism precedes and determines that of its organs, thus grounding the\nharmony of their respective forms and functions. [274]  (2) It is also worth\nnoting that the differentiation of family members is qualitative, not merely\nquantitative i.e.  the woman is not simply an imperfect man, thus  her function\nis distinct from that of her husband, again mirroring the specific\ndifferentiation of organs within a body. [275]   (3) Lastly, let us note that\nthe roles are not attributed arbitrarily according to Aristotle. T his is\nattested, for instance, by the distinction he establishes between legitimate\n(natural) and violent acts of enslavement in the 6th chapter. On Aristotle’s\naccount, there exists a proportionality between the intrinsic character of\nindividual members and their role within the household. Again, there is a clear\ncorrespondence with the constitution of organisms, more precisely it reflects\nthe intimate relation of the anatomy and physiology of living things, for the\nspecific function parts is determined by its intrinsic character e.g.  eye and\nliver tissues are not interchangeable; they are, in virtue of their intrinsic\ncharacters (transparency, permeability, etc.), specifically adapted to their\nrespective function.",

When confronted\nwith Aristotle’s teleological accounts of the relationship between organisms;\nrather than reevaluate his strictly individualistic view of Aristotelian\nteleology, Johnson accuses Aristotle of systematically mis-using his own\nteleological principles “Because these relationships do not genuinely have the\nkind of organic unity that real organisms do, the extrapolation of teleological\nexplanations from organisms to relations between organisms must be judged a\nfailure.”   [278]  Johnson’s argument is circular; the question at hand is\nwhether higher-level entities are an appropriate subject of teleological\nexplanations, and he answers by the negative on the basis that these\nhigher-level teleological accounts are a failure, because they have an\ninadequate subject. He does not say why higher level entities may not be said to\nhave organic unity, [279]   yet  the whole treatise on Politics  is grounded in\nthe premise that they do.

[281]  He claims that Aristotle shares his concern and that we can\nget a glimpse of this in his discussion of the Platonic view of the unity of the\ncity. [282]  He suggests that Aristotle’s comments in this passage indicate that\nhe, like Johnson, doubts that communities are truly one thing , i.e.  that he\n is aware that it is problematic to extend the logic of part-whole relations\nbeyond the realm of middle sized substances; [283]   but Aristotle’s objective\nin this passage is in fact to clarify in what sense the city is one .\nAristotle’s main point is that the kind of unity that belongs to the city allows\nfor (in fact presupposes) the heterogeneity of its parts. In other words, by\ncriticizing Plato’s emphasis on homogeneity, Aristotle clarifies his own organic\nview of the part-whole structure of higher level entities; and emphasizes the\nintegrity and diversity of their constitutive elements. While we contend he goes\ntoo far in dismissing the teleological accounts found in the Politics , we\nrecognize that some of Johnson’s concerns are legitimate [284]  and demand a\nmore exhaustive discussion than we can provide here. For now, let it be\nsufficient to note that individuals are considered by Aristotle to be parts of a\ncommunity which exists by nature and has  a specific end which is distinct –\nalthough intimately related – to that of its parts. The upshot is that, while\nman has a certain integrity qua  individual substance, he is not complete in an\nabsolute sense. In short, the part-whole analysis which we find in the Politics\n suggests the same kind of quasi-intrinsic relations which we described in\nconsidering part-whole relations within organisms in our second chapter. Thus\nfor reasons examined in that context, the organic view of the unity of natural\ncommunities defended by Aristotle need not be understood in a way that\nundermines the integrity of its parts. Simply, we should say that being part of\na community and contributing to the actualization of its telos  presupposes\nrather than undermines the integrity of individuals just as the teleological\norganization of the living body presupposes rather than undermines the nature of\nits constitutive elements. To take up the semantic analogy, the first book of\nthe Politics seems to suggest that a sentence (which we compared to a\nsubstance), while it is meaningful and may be understood to some degree when\nread on its own, is not completely self-contained and should ultimately be\nunderstood in the context of a paragraph (family), which in turn exists within a\nchapter (city state).

More\nprecisely, we must overcome our view of political communities as the arbitrary\ncreation of the mind if we are to grasp the significance of these passages for\nthinking about the teleological organization of non-human nature. If human\ncommunities are the result of arbitrary desires, then their teleological\norganization is of no interest to the natural philosopher, [286]  but we have\nshown in our first chapter that man’s goal-directed deliberative  efforts are\nnever arbitrary according to Aristotle (for if they are, they are not genuinely\ngoal-directed); thus the formation of the state, even if it involves a component\nof deliberation, must be understood primarily as the expression of the specific\nnature or form of the community. Thus, we suggest that the kind of part-whole\nanalysis which we find in the Politics   could be applied to non-human nature.\nThis is attested by Aristotle's reliance on the household analogy for\nillustrating the way in which “the nature of the universe contains the good ”\n in   Metaphysics XII 10:\n\nAnd all things are ordered together somehow, but not all alike, —both fishes and\nfowls and plants; and the world is not such that one thing has nothing to do\nwith another, but they are connected. For all are ordered together to one end.\n(But it is as in a house, where the freemen are least at liberty to act as they\nwill, but all things or most things are already ordained for them, while the\nslaves and the beasts do little for the common good, and for the most part live\nat random; for this is the sort of principle that constitutes the nature of\neach.) [287]  I mean, for instance, that all must at least come to be dissolved\ninto their elements, and there are other functions similarly in which all share\nfor the good of the whole. ( Metaph . XII 10, 1075 a10-25) [288]\n\n\n\nThe analogy re-emphasizes Aristotle’s organic view of human communities, [289]\n but most importantly, attests to his view of the organization of the cosmos as\na whole; namely, it makes it clear that it is indeed a whole, [290]  and not\njust a collection of beings. In fact, let us note that the household analogy,\ni.e.  the view that natural substances are more than “roommates” (completely\nself-sufficient entities which happen to share a living space), is the basic\npremise of the science of ecology which is in fact named after the household\nanalogy.

However, it may be appropriate to invoke them now, as they align\nnicely with the perspective developed in the passages examined up to this point.\n[292]  We have in mind especially: (1) the notorious passages from the Parts of\nAnimals [293]  and the History of Animals [294]  which mention the role played\nby the awkward location of the mouths of sharks and dolphins in regulating their\nrates of predation (2) as well as the passage from the Politics [295]  which\nsuggest a certain organization of feeding relations within the natural world\n[296] ; (3) and the (less discussed) passage from the History of Animals [297]\n which presents the rapid multiplication of mice and their disastrous effects on\ntheir surroundings as a deviation from the otherwise harmonious equilibrium\nbetween prey reproduction and predator pressure. These remarks suggest an\norganization of nature beyond the level of living organisms, for as Leroi\nrightly notes, Aristotle surely   “grasps that such a balance does not emerge\nautomatically from any self-interested assemblage of organisms, but must be\ndesigned by nature”. [298]  Beyond the general suggestion that nature is more\nthan an aggregate of self-interested beings, these comments also attest to an\navant-garde intuition of predator-prey dynamics. (4) Also visionary are his\nremarks concerning the symbiosis of biotic and abiotic cycles; [299]  (5) his\ndiscussion of antagonistic and mutualistic relations in the first chapter of\nbook IX of the History of Animals ; (6) as well as his remarks concerning the\nimportance of decomposition in natural cycles, in the Metaphysics and in the\ntreatise on Meteorology. [300]   We find in these passages the seeds of\nimportant ecological concepts [301]  which, although they are not developed and\nconsequently fall short of forming the basis of a comprehensive ecological\nperspective, still suggest a compatibility between the Aristotelian view of\nnature and the science of ecology. These insights, let us insist, align\nperfectly with the organic view of the unity of nature at higher levels of\norganization which Aristotle develops in other contexts.

      "pageContent": "[18]  In short, strong  global teleologists take all things to have the exact\nsame purpose; to serve/please God or Humans, and thus do not do justice to the\nspecific differentiation of the ends of natural substances. Weak global\nteleologists, on the other hand, do not see an opposition between the diversity\nand unity of natural purposes. Instead of being grounded in uniformity, they\ntake the unity of the specifically distinct  ends of natural substances to be\ngrounded in the inner directedness  towards an overarching good order, as is the\ncase with the unity of the specifically distinct ends of the organs constituting\na body. Gonzalez (2020), Leroi (2014) and Sedley (2008) do make this distinction\nand only reject the former definitively.\n\n\n\n[19]  Leroi, 2014, p. 87; Gonzalez, 2020 ; Scharle, 2008   p. 148 ;  Nussbaum,\n1978, p. 100 ;  Lennox, 1992, p. 328 ; Wardy, 1993, p. 12-14 ; Broadie, 1987,\np.41.\n\n[20]  This is because the good is always practicable according to Aristotle\n(Johnson, 2005, p. 247).\n\n[21]  Johnson, 2005, p. 124-125 ; Wardy, 1993, p. 13-14.\n\n[22]  Johnson, 2005, p.62, 234 ;  Gonzalez, 2020, p. 151.\n\n[23]  Johnson, 2005, p. 76-77, 85-90, 100-101 ; Gonzalez, 2020, p. 165 ;\nJohansen, 2004, p.77, 86 ;   Depew, 1997, p. 221-222 Broadie, 1990, p. 91 ;\nGotthelf, 1987 ;  Blair, 1992, p. 17-31.\n\n[24]  Ph .

His work is not intended to be an exhaustive account of\nAristotelian teleology. Of course, his project does require dealing with many\nimportant aspects of teleology, which is why he is one of the scholars whose\ncontribution is the most substantial, but inevitably he leaves many important\nquestions unanswered. (Leroi, 2014).\n\n\n\n[29]  Kahn’s project is to clarify the role of the prime mover in Aristotelian\nteleology. Consequently, there are important aspects of Aristotle’s teleology\nwhich he is not concerned with, such as the internality of natural causes, the\ncontrast with artificial causes, the nature of the beneficiary of teleological\nchange, etc. (Kahn, 1985)\n\n\n\n[30]  There are some who open the door to wider views of the scope of teleology,\nbut do not develop them in a systematic and exhaustive manner (Zeller, 1883 ;\n Gomprez, 1909 ;  Grene, 1972 ;  Leroi, 2014 ;  Baghdassarian, 2016 ;  Morel,\n2016)\n\n[31]  Ross, 1923, p. 126.\n\n[32]   Lennox, 1992,  p. 325-26 .",

See for instance his discussion of “suicidal deers” on p.26-7\nwhich suggests a lack of nuance in thinking about the way in which entities may\nserve external ends, as well as his concluding thoughts (p.29).\n\n[34]  Ross, 1923, p.126 ;  Nussbaum, 1978, p. 95-96 ;  Lennox, 1992, p. 326 ;\nJohnson, 2005, p. 62, p.234 ; Gonzalez, 2020, p. 151.\n\n[35]  The notion that the good exists separately, in another realm.\n\n[36]  A view which grounds the unity of purposes in uniformity and presupposes\nthat it is incompatible with their specific differentiation.\n\n[37]  The notion that the primary  function of natural substances is to serve\nanother entity (God, humans, or the cosmos) .\n\n[38]   A view which reduces natural substances to products of (divine) craft.\n\n[39]  Occasionally, other, more nuanced, senses of the terms are mentioned, but\ntheir signification  and implications are not thoroughly explored. For instance\nNussbaum (1978), although she advocates for narrowing the scope of teleological\naccounts to the explanation of the functional parts of biological organisms,\ndoes remark that Aristotle’s recognition of interspecies (or as we would say\ntoday, ecological) relations might complicate the matter and raise some\nquestions for the narrowly intrinsic account (p.97), but she does not clearly\nformulate or engage with these questions.\n\n[40]  Johnson, 2005.\n\n[41]  This is often considered a weakness by those who review Johnson’s work.\nThe worry is that he does not do justice to important and difficult passages\nwhen he deals with them in only a few pages. We find it appreciable that his\ninterpretation is grounded, not only in the small bits of texts that concern\nfinal causes explicitly, but in the many treatises in which we find traces,\napplications, and implications of Aristotle’s teleological perspective.\n\n\n\n[42]  A principle which Johnson (2005) does, in some contexts, recognize to be\nat the heart of Aristotle’s thought, and which he invokes in distinguishing\nAristotle’s teleology from Empedocles’ position (p.99) as well as that of\nAnaxagoras and Plato (p.125)\n\n[43]  A view which he develops in contrast with an incomplete and simplistic\nview of what global  teleology entails.\n\n[44]  Consider the way in which he systematically undermines the analogies used\nby Aristotle to teach us about the unity found at higher levels of organization\n(Johnson, 2005,  p.229-246, 271-286)\n\n[45]  Let us insist that we will not address all of these points within the\ncontext of this thesis; we will be concerned mainly with the first limitation\n(Johnson’s unbalanced view of hylomorphic compounds) and will consider the\nsecond (his restricted view of the beneficiary) only in a preliminary manner, in\nour conclusion.",

Generation of Animals  (Platt, Trans.).\n\n\n\n[78]  As established in Ph.  VIII, 4, 255a 25-30.\n\n\n\n[79]  Johnson (2005) uses the term intrinsic, but we will use the term\nexplanatory (even for referring to his interpretation) when he means  intrinsic\nin the general sense which applies to both artificial and natural causes.\n\n[80]  Johnson, 2005, p. 61 .\n\n[81]  For instance, on the next page Johnson (2005) says that:   “Knowing the\ncauses of something belongs to theoretical knowledge, the objects of which are\n intrinsic causes or natures . Knowing the uses of something, on the other hand,\nis practical knowledge.”  ( p. 62)   In the next chapter we can read;   “\npractical knowledge which, like art, knows how to use things and is concerned\nnot with  internal and intrinsic forms but with a form and a principle in\nanother.” (p. 77) Again, in discussing Aristotle’s critique of Empedocles,\nJohnson first notes that Aristotle considered Empedocles’ account of nature to\nbe problematic because it rests on incidental rather than explanatory causes,\n(p. 98)   but then goes on to cite a passage from Physics II 6 (p. 100) where\nAristotle contrasts the internality of natural causes with the externality of\nluck, without noting that they are different (although related) points.\n\n[82]   Aristotle. (1984). On The Soul  (Smith, Trans.).\n\n[83]  Ph . VIII, 259b10-15 –  This is something Johnson (2005) himself notes (p.\n141).\n\n[84]  On Johnson’s (2005) account, the horse’s contribution to the good order of\nits ecosystem is just as incidental as its contribution in the racing event.\nBoth ends, because they do not constitute the intrinsic end of the horse, are\nequally irrelevant scientifically. The consequence of this view is that a\nnatural scientist should not, for instance, be concerned with the horse’s place\nin the food chain and other such relational  aspects of its natural life. In\nother words, Johnson’s identification of internal, natural, and explanatory\n(intrinsic) causes leads him to deny the possibility for Aristotelian teleology\nto be reconciled with a science of ecology. Here we are getting ahead of\nourselves, for this question belongs to the second of the four-step project\noutlined in the introduction. For now, let us simply note that Johnson’s\nidentification of internal and explanatory causes leads him to make significant\nclaims and that his justification for doing so is unconvincing.\n\n\n\n[85]   A view which we said is common in the literature that aims at emphasizing\nthe contrast between Aristotle’s naturalistic perspective and the artificial\nview of his predecessors.\n\n[86]   In fact he relies on craft analogies to teach us about all four causes,\nsee Ph.  II 3 194 b18-35.\n\n[87]  Johnson, 2005, p. 203 ;   Johansen, 2004, p. 69 ; Charles, 1991, p. 107 ;\nCooper, 1982, p. 221-222.\n\n[88]  Furt, 1988, p. 181 ; Johnson, 2005, p. 126 ; Sedley, 2008, p. 174 ;\nLeunissen, 2010, p. 17.",

In all these cases, he emphasizes both the differentiation and\ncontinuity of the different objects and ways of knowing them.

Politics  (Jowett, Trans.).\n\n[131]  Let us note also that the violent arts which are practiced for the sake\nof  attaining non-substantial ends are unnatural in more than one way. First, as\nwe have said, in the sense that their end is not borrowed from nature, and\nsecond in the sense that it leads the so-called artist to make unnatural\n(violent) use of things through his practice. See  Pol. I,9 1157a7-12 ;\n1158a7-13.\n\n[132]  Sedley, 1991, p. 187.\n\n[133]  Johnson, 2005, p. 235-237.\n\n[134]  Johnson (2005) does not distinguish the arts with regards to the nature\nof their end results, or their relation to natural ends because according to\nhim, there exists an unbridgeable gap between what something is (the object of\ntheoretical knowledge) and what it is used for   (object of practical knowledge)\n(p.78, 213-14) and consequently, no proportionality between natural and\nartificial ends.\n\n\n\n[135]  Of course these things are not unrelated, which is why we must insist\nonce again that Johnson’s position is limited rather than wrong. Indeed, in the\nvast majority of cases, a sane person whose intention is to satisfy a natural\nneed will act purposefully i.e.   take an appropriate series of steps for the\nsake of realizing a goal that has genuine being and unity. For instance if\nsomeone has the intention of providing shelter for his family, chances are that\nhe will set out to build a house, not a vistemboir . However, because Johnson’s\nview emphasizes the psychological dimension of artificial goal-directedness, it\nleaves room for cases where the intention is the fulfillment of a natural need,\nbut the ‘goal’ is non-substantial. For instance, Johnson would have no ground to\ndeny that a madman who sets out to build a vistemboir for the sake of  providing\nshelter for his family is practicing a natural craft.\n\n[136]  Johnson, 2005, p. 101.\n\n[137]  Johnson, 2005, p.101 – footnote no.16.

Physics  (Hardie & Gaye, Trans.).\n\n[157]  Sedley, 1991, p. 188.\n\n[158]   The close connection of nature and craft has been a leitmotif  of this\nchapter. Let us note that there seems to be a tendency in the scholarship to\naccentuate the distinction, perhaps because of a desire to establish a firm\ndistinction between natural and artificial teleology. In any case, it is\nfrequent to compare unequal things in order to emphasize the contrast between\nnature and the arts. Consider for instance Gonzalez’ (2020) discussion of the\nrelation which holds between the formal and material principles in craft and\nnature. He compares the way in which the telos belongs to bricks and wood on one\nhand, and to natural bodies on the other (p. 164) Although his main point is one\nwe agree with (namely that in crafts, the material cause is not intrinsically\ndirected towards the state of completion of the artifacts and thus requires the\nintervention of an artist) the example on which rests his explanation does not\ncompare like with like. As a result, the distinction between natural and\nartificial goal-directedness appears with – excessive– clarity and simplicity;\nand bypasses a series of questions which would be raised by establishing the\ncomparison at the same level of organization e.g by comparing the use of wood to\nthe way in which the elements are made to serve the organism’s purpose. See also\nKosman, 2013, p. 88-9.\n\n[159]  A view which, we have said, is discussed exhaustively by Johnson (2005),\nbut shared by many ( Cooper , 1982 ; Gotthelf, 1987 ;  Broadie, 1990 ;  Charles,\n1991 ;  Blair, 1992 ;  Depew, 1997 ;  Johansen, 2004 ;   Gonzalez, 2020).\n\n[160]  Let us note that Johnson (2005) sometimes does recognize the existence of\nnatural instrumental relations, for instance in his discussion of hypothetical\nnecessity (p. 189-192); but this is at the expense of coherence with the view he\nadopts when discussing the scope of teleology. (p. 60-2, p.201-3)\n\n\n\n[161]  Recall Johnson’s (2005) table of comparison of the horses’ intrinsic and\nincidental ends (p.203).\n\n[162]  Again, Johnson (2005) is not alone to hold this view, for exhaustive\nreferences to scholarly works which defend the same view of the unity of natural\nsubstances see Byrne, 2012, p.389 – footnote no.8.\n\n[163]  Johnson, 2005, p. 144.\n\n[164]  Byrne, 2018 ;  Gelber, 2016 ;  Cooper, 2004, p. 108 ;  Nussbaum, 1978, p.\n115-118.\n\n[165]  Gelber, 2016, p. 258 ; Byrne, 2018, p. 117 –footnote no.37.\n\n[166]  Gelber, 2016, p. 286-287.\n\n[167]  Namely in discussing the natural motion of elements ( Ph . VIII, 4, 255 a\n25-27) and animal respiration ( Ph . VIII, 4 259b10-15).\n\n[168]   We shall come back to the topic of teleology beyond organisms  in our\nconclusion.\n\n[169]  For references to scholarly works which establish this distinction see\nByrne (2012, p. 390 –footnote no.11).",

She also developed this view more recently in her articles\nUnity of definition in Metaphysics H.6 and Z.12  (2010) and   Hylomorphism\nReconceived (2021). While Johnson (2005) also develops this perspective to some\nextent, our analysis will focus on Gill’s work because she treats this question\nmore exhaustively.\n\n\n\n[179]  She recognizes that being potentially something entails being actually\nsomething else (Gill, 2021,  p. 184) – Although, in her book she sometimes seems\nto equate the loss of a relational property of that which acts as a material\ncause with the ceasing-to-be of that subject, see for instance her discussion of\nPh. I 9 (Gill, 1989, p. 149).\n\n[180]  Gill, 2021, p. 194 . See also Gill, 2010, p.118-120   and Gill, 1989, p.\n152-3.\n\n[181]  Gill, 2021, p. 185, 196 ; Gill, 2010, p.119. We find the same tension in\nJohnsons’ (2005) account (p. 144-5)\n\n\n\n[182]  She also argues that while we may qualify an object with reference to its\nproximate material cause; it would be incorrect to characterize it with\nreference to the matter at lower levels of organization (Gill, 2010, p. 120),\nbut, it is unclear why this would be a mistake. While for practical reasons it\nis rare that we do so, we could very well refer to an artifact as a mix of\ncertain elements. For instance, a potter who explains the proportions of earth\nand water which make up his clay bowl would not be ‘mistaken’ when he describes\nthem as being made out of these remote materials. Gill provides no reason why it\nwould be correct to say that the potter’s artifact is made of clay; but false to\nclaim that it is made of water and earth – this is especially surprising since,\naccording to her view, the clay is no more actually present than are the\nelements.\n\n[183]  Gill, 1989, p. 152.",

The material properties of a sphere,\nwhich connect it with its simpler origins, are not properties of the constituent\nbronze as an independent actual subject, but properties of the sphere it\nconstitutes” ( Gill, 2010, p. 119) Thus her view demands that the same\nproperties have different explanations depending on whether the elements exist\nseparately or in a compound.\n\n[185]  Gill, 1989, p. 157.\n\n[186]  Gill, 2010, p. 120.\n\n[187]   In line with this, let us recall what Aristotle said about the\ncombination of elements into genuine wholes (by contrast with heaps) in\nMetaphysics VII 17   ; “The syllable, then, is something – not its phonetic\nelements alone, the sounded (=A) and the unsounded (=B), but also something\nelse, and the flesh is not only fire and earth or the hot and the cold but also\nsomething else .”   Aristotle.

The tactile properties of water, for instance, are grounded in the\nformal cause of water when it exists by itself; but when it exhibits those same\nproperties within the context of composition, they are to be explained with\nreference to the formal principle of the higher-level compound.

Recognizing the functional organization of nature\nat the level of plant communities or whole ecosystems for instance, does not\ncommit one to the view that they are organisms or substances; but only to the\nview that they are something more than a heap i.e.  more than a result  of the\nindividual activity of individual substances.\n\n[257]  Let us note that Aristotle is in fact concerned with neither of these\nquestions in the passage from Ph.  II8 (more on this below).\n\n[258]  In line with this, see Byrne’s argument for the extension of the scope of\nteleology (2018, p. 115-119). He insists (p.118) on the importance of\nidentifying the subject of a given teleological account – namely to specify the\nright level of composition. He notes, for instance, that a teleological account\nof the role played by water in eye formation has the eye, not  the water as its\nsubject. Thus, he points out, describing water’s contribution to sight is part\nof the explanation of eyes, not water. Similarly, we suggest an account of the\nfunctional organization of individual substances into higher-level functional\nwholes has the latter as its subject, not  the individual substances.\n\n[259]  The view, often attributed to Plato and Socrates, which affirms  a more\ndirect and apparent unity of the purposiveness found in nature, one which\npresupposes uniformity , for it take all substances to have the exact same\npurpose  ( e.g.  to serve/please God or Humans), and thus undermines the\nspecific differentiation of natural ends.\n\n[260]  Comparable, not identical.\n\n[261]   Let us note that those who wish to restrict teleological accounts to the\nrealm of middle-sized substances ( i.e.  defend the view that Aristotelian\nteleology cannot, by principle, explain the relation between organisms) too must\n‘break Aristotle’s silence’.",

For the more radical view that\nAristotle’s teleology is in fact by principle opposed to the presuppositions of\necology, see Johnson, 2005, p. 209.\n\n\n\n[263]  The History of Animals  is a work of zoology, Parts of Animals a work of\ncomparative anatomy, Generation of Animals a study of reproductive physiology,\nand Motion of Animals  is concerned with biomechanics.\n\n\n\n[264]  Some ( e.g.  Gonzalez, 2020, p. 149) suggest that the rarity of\necological speculation in these treatises should puzzle us if we suppose that\nAristotle did consider nature to be organized beyond individuals. We contend\nthat given the topic of these works, it is nothing surprising. What is puzzling\nis Aristotle’s choice not to write an ecological treatise. As Leroi notes  “\nAristotle has the ingredients of community ecology in his hands but does not use\nthem”.   (2014, p. 319) Let us note, however, that it is much more surprising\nthat a so-called local teleologist would write the Politics , than it is that a\nglobal teleologist would fail to produce an ecological treatise.\n\n\n\n[265]   HA VIII 2, 591 b23-30 ; PA  IV 13, 696 b24 -34.\n\n[266]   Ph.

Aristotle argues against those who claim that the\npossibility to explain rain in terms of material necessity entails that it is\nnot for the sake of  an end. He suggests that the opposition of material and\nteleological accounts is a mistake and that in truth, to determine whether\nsomething is a result  of chance or the end  of a goal-directed process, we must\nconsider the regularity of the event. Whether the event is a result ( e.g. rain\nin winter) or an end (rain in summer), Aristotle argues, the mechanical account\nstill holds. Given the purpose of his argument in that context, he does not\nprovide a detailed account of the instrumental role of rain in crop growth, but\nsimply mentions it in passing. The passages from PA and  HA  appear within the\ncontext of an investigation of the way of life of a specific animal. While it is\ntrue that Aristotle’s comments in these (and other similar) passages may serve\nas circumstantial evidence of his general sympathy towards the idea that nature\nis well ordered beyond the level of individuals, this is not the question at\nhand in those contexts, thus they constitute a weak and inadequate foundation\nfor establishing Aristotle’s view on the application of teleology beyond the\nlevel of organisms.\n\n[268]   Aristotle.

Politics  (Jowett, Trans.).\n\n[269]   In line with this, he insists on the specific differentiation of kinds\n of communities based on their respective formal and final cause ( Pol. I 1,\n1252a10). See also book VII chapter 4; where the city is clearly considered to\nbe an entity with a definite nature or form. See also book V chapter 3 (1302b35)\nwhich compares the growth of cities to organic development.\n\n[270]   “And therefore, if earlier forms of society are natural, so is the\nstate, for it is the end of them and the nature of a thing is its end. For what\neach thing is when fully developed, we call its nature, whether we are speaking\nof a man, a horse, or a family. ” ( Pol.  I 1,  1252 b30 -35).   Aristotle.\n(1984). Politics  (Jowett, Trans.).\n\n\n\n\n\n[271]   Aristotle. (1984). Politics  (Jowett, Trans.).\n\n[272]   Pol . I 2, 1253a35 also suggests that the isolated individual is somehow\ndehumanized: “ If he has not excellence, he is the most unholy and the worst\nsavage of animals, and the most full of lust and gluttony. But justice is the\nbond of men in state; for the administration of justice, which is the\ndetermination of what is just, is the principle of order in political society.”.\n\n[273]  See especially chapters 2-7.\n\n[274]  In Pol . III 4, 1277 a5-7 he explicitly compares the diversity of the\nparts of a city to that of the internal parts of an organism; and again at 1277\nb20-25.\n\n[275]   “So it must necessarily be supposed to be with the excellences of\ncharacter also; all should partake of them, but only in such a manner  and\ndegree as is required by each for the fulfillment of his function.” ( Pol.  I\n13,  1260 a15-20)   Aristotle. (1984). Politics  (Jowett, Trans.). Along the\nsame line see Pol. III 4, 1277a5-12. See also Pol   IV 4, 1290b21-35 for an\nexplicit comparison between the functions of organs and the role of individual\nmembers of a community.\n\n\n\n[276]  Leroi calls the Politics  a work of sociobiology (2014, p. 311), and\nJohnson likewise recognizes that “Aristotle treats political science to some\nextent like a natural science”   (2005, p. 238).\n\n\n\n[277]   In fact, Johnson (2005) covers a lot more ground than we are able to\nhere, the whole section ( 8.5 ) contains precious references (primary and\nsecondary) and constitutes a very helpful starting point for investigating\nAristotle’s views on the teleological organization beyond individual substances.\n\n[278]  Johnson, 2005, p. 238.\n\n[279]   It seems that perhaps Johnson has in mind that granting organic unity to\na whole community entails that it is a living organism.\n\n[280]  Johnson, 2005, p. 246.  \n\n[281]  On p.243 Johnson (2005) includes yet another comparative table which\nopposes strictly intrinsic ends and arbitrary instrumental uses.\n\n\n\n[282]   Pol . II 2. For a helpful discussion of this passage, see Narbonne\n(2020).\n\n[283]  Johnson, 2005, p.245.",

For a helpful discussion of this passage, see Narbonne\n(2020).\n\n[283]  Johnson, 2005, p.245.\n\n[284]  For instance, he is right to note that presenting individual humans as\nfunctional rather than compositional parts of the family seems to undermine\ntheir status as a substance. (Johnson, 2005, p.241). Wardy expresses the same,\nand other related concerns (1993, p. 25-26).\n\n[285]   In other words, we suggest that in Aristotle's view, we can find being\nin different – but reconcilable – ways at different levels of organization. By\ncontrast, Johnson’s perspective entails a ‘horizontal’ ontology, in the sense\nthat everything exists at the same level of composition, i.e. according to him,\nnatural substances are ‘besides’ one another, so to speak, and may never be in\npart-whole relations, which means that everything above (and below) the level of\nnatural substances is a useful but arbitrary abstraction at best.\n\n\n\n[286]  This is the view implied by Johnson’s reading of the passage from Pol . I\n8 (2005, p. 231). In order to reconcile Aristotle’s comments about the\ninstrumental role played by plants in animal development with his narrowly\nintrinsic view, Johnson has to create a gap between practical and theoretical\nknowledge and say that Aristotle’s discussion of instrumental relations in the\nPolitics  is true from the perspective of prudence, but false from the\nperspective of science. Along the same line, see Wardy, 1993, p. 23.\n\n[287]  Along the same line, see Mete. IV 12, 390a3-15.\n\n[288]   Aristotle. (1984). Metaphysics  (Ross, Trans.).\n\n[289]   For as we have said, if the teleological organization of the family was\nthe result of arbitrary intentions, it would be irrelevant to natural science.\nSee also MA 703a29 where living organisms are compared to a well ordered city.\n\n[290]   Metaph. VIII 1, 1042a10. See also Leroi, 2014, p. 325.\n\n[291]  “When, in 1866, Ernst Haeckel coined oekologie  to describe the new\nscience of the economics of nature, it was from oikos – Greek for household –\nthat he did so.”  (Leroi, 2014, p. 321).\n\n[292]   This, we contend, is the appropriate use of these passages. They may\nlegitimately be used as indirect evidence which complement  an interpretation\nwhich is itself grounded in passages that deal more directly with the issue of\nteleology beyond middle-sized substances.\n\n[293]  PA  IV 13, 696 b24 -34.\n\n[294]  HA VIII 2, 591 b23 -30.\n\n[295]   Pol.  I 8, 1256b10-25 ; see also De Plantis I 2, 817b25.",

(1984).

By contrast Johnson (2005) attributes to Aristotle a\nperspective which entails that order and harmony at higher levels of\norganization can be nothing more than a happy coincidence.\n\n[299]  See for instance the notorious passage from Ph. II 8 (198 b16 - 199 a9);\nas well as in HA  VIII 19, 601b25  which discuss the relation of plants and\nanimals to rain cycles.

  "text": "THE NARROW VIEW\n\nThe scholars mentioned above do not always explicitly distinguish these\ndifferent meanings, nor do they examine their relation thoroughly, and although\nthey manifest a desire to move past an inaccurate understanding of Aristotle’s\nposition, they usually do not provide an exhaustive discussion of the\nimplications and presuppositions of his perspective. In most cases, their\ncontribution is limited by the fact that teleology is not the primary object of\ntheir inquiry.

  "text": "Because of the exhaustive nature of Johnson’s work, he will be our primary\ninterlocutor. Let us therefore provide a more comprehensive account of his view\nin order to delineate the contrast with our own. Fundamentally, Johnson’s view\nrests on three premises; the priority of nature over the arts, the internality\nof natural causes, and the identification of internal and explanatory causes.\n[50]  From these he concludes that Aristotle’s natural teleology is rooted\nexclusively in internal causes and consequently excludes instrumental relations\nfrom its scope. In the course of our work, we will contest the third premise and\nchallenge the resulting limitations of the scope of Aristotelian teleology.\nJohnson rightly insists that the distinction between natural and artificial\ncauses lies in the location of the principle of motion. [51]  He also does well\nto highlight the distinction between intrinsic and incidental causes; the former\nbeing explanatory and therefore relevant to scientific investigations, and the\nlatter not suitable for grounding a teleological (or any kind of scientific)\nexplanation. [52]  However, we will argue that his account becomes problematic\nwhen [53]   he treats  these two distinctions as coextensive, [54]  and infers\nthat only internal causes are explanatory and can ground scientific\nexplanations. We find in Johnson’s work no satisfactory justification for\ntreating these distinctions as coextensive, yet the consequences he draws from\nthis are significant, namely that any good a natural substance may contribute to\nis incidental to it, and thus irrelevant to theoretical science. The result is a\npolarizing view of nature and the arts where nature is the domain of strictly\nintrinsic principles, whereas crafts is associated with extrinsic and incidental\ncauses.  This antithetical view of nature and the arts is best illustrated by\nthe table he includes on top of p.203  where he compares the intrinsic and\ninternal final causes of a horse ( e.g.  life and reproduction) with its\nincidental and external ends ( e.g.  gambling and racing). While Johnson is\nright to insist that the latter have no place in the scientific explanation of\nhorses, we contend it is a mistake to suppose that all  external goods to which\na horse may contribute are equally arbitrary and scientifically irrelevant. In\nsimple terms, it rests on the premise that there exists no middle ground between\nthe self-actualization and arbitrary use of a natural substance. [55]"

This is made manifest by the\nfact that, according to Aristotle, (1) some causes are physically internal yet\nnot natural, and (2) some natural changes have a cause which is located ‘in\nother things’.\n\nLet us first consider the rest of the opening passage of Physics II 1 which\nsuggests that physical internality does not, in and of itself, make a cause the\nnatural  principle of the motion it initiates:\n\nnature is a cause of being moved and of being at rest in that to which it\nbelongs primarily, in virtue of itself and not accidentally. I say ‘not\naccidentally’ because (for instance) a man who is a doctor might cure himself.\nNevertheless it is not insofar as he is a patient that he possesses the art of\nmedicine: it merely has happened that the same man is doctor and patient – and\nthat is why these attributes are not always found together. So it is with all\nother artificial products. None of them has in itself the principle of its own\nproduction. But while in some cases (for instance houses and other products of\nmanual labour ) that principle is in something else external to the thing, in\nothers – those which may cause a change in themselves accidentally – it lies in\nthe things themselves (but not in virtue of what they are). ( Ph . II 1, 192 b\n24-34) [58] .\n--------\n\nGiven the new context, refine the summary.\nIf the context isn't useful, return the original summary.\n\nTotal output will be a summary of the article.\n\nSUMMARY:"

That means that it is\nwhat it is to be for a body of the character just assigned.” ( De An.  II 1,\n412b10 ).

Something may be called potential (1)in the sense\nthat it is receptive of a given determination or capacity e.g.  the bronze is\npotentially a statue or (2) in the sense that it has a capacity, but is being\nprevented from actualizing it e.g.  a heavy object held up in the air is\npotentially on the ground.   The second sense is more ‘actual’, and in fact\ncorresponds to what Aristotle elsewhere calls ‘first actuality’. [71]  To\nillustrate this contrast, he suggests that we compare the way in which an\nignorant man and a scientist who is not actively contemplating (say, because he\nis sleeping) are said to be ‘capable’ of scientific contemplation. [72]  Things\nwhich are naturally  moved by something else have a potency which, Aristotle\nsays, is akin to that of the sleeping scientist rather than that of the ignorant\nman. The passive principle present in the elements thus corresponds to a first\ndegree of actuality. To elaborate on the analogy, if someone were to wake up the\nscientist, we should call him the incidental cause of the scientific\ncontemplation which then occurs, for he is not by virtue of what he is  a cause\nof scientific contemplation. The explanatory cause in this case is rather the\nknowledge in  the former sleeper. Thus the actualization of scientific\ncontemplation, although initiated by an external agent, is natural because the\nexplanatory cause is intrinsically  internal to the scientist. Similarly,\nalthough the motion of elements towards their natural place is initiated by\nsomething external, the explanatory cause is their inner inclination, which is\nintrinsically  internal, for it constitutes their essence. In short, elemental\nmotion is natural because the external mover is only an incidental cause of the\nmotion.\n\nLet us also note that even in the case of living things, Aristotle thinks many\nnatural functions have their source in a physically external principle. [73]\n Respiration, increase and decrease (development and deterioration), and other\nsuch natural   activities are said to have their source in external\nenvironmental factors, [74]  and the generation of animals and plants is in a\nsense externally caused because the parent is (numerically) distinct from the\noffspring. In the treatise on the Generation of Animals, Aristotle says the\nfollowing concerning the externality of the cause of natural generation:\n--------\n\nGiven the new context, refine the summary.\nIf the context isn't useful, return the original summary.\n\nTotal output will be a summary of the article.\n\nSUMMARY:"

The article also examines Aristotle's statement that \"it is possible for this to have moved that, and that this other, and for it to be like those wondrous automata,\" where the external thing is in a certain way moving them, not by making contact with any part now, but by having made contact with one. The article uses examples from Physics II 5 and the Generation of Animals to show how Aristotle's understanding of explanatory and incidental causes applies to both art and nature, although the difference lies in the fact that in nature, the active and passive principles are one and the same whereas in craft they are different. The article argues that the internal movement is the explanatory cause of natural processes, such as the generation of parts, while external factors may initiate these processes but are not the explanatory cause.\n\nBelow you find a portion of the article:\n--------\nWe can now go back to the passage from Physics  II 1 where nature is defined as\nan inner principle of motion and state with clarity what it means. The\ninternality of natural causes has to be understood both physically and\nessentially, for as we have said, natural causes are intrinsically internal. Let\nus reemphasize the fact that natural causes can be described as intrinsic in two\nways. First, generally, in the sense that they are by virtue of what they are\n related to the result they produce. In this respect, they are like artificial\ncauses and unlike chance (and other incidental causes). Second, natural causes\nare said to be by virtue of what they are , internal to the patient in which\nthey produce a change. This second qualification indicates a deeper unity of\nmover and moved . It is in this respect that natural principles can be\ncontrasted with artificial causes, for the latter can be internal only\nincidentally. In short, agent-patient relations in craft are intrinsic only in\nthe first sense, whereas in nature, the relation is intrinsic in both senses.\nThus when qualifying natural causes as ‘intrinsic’, it is important to specify\nwhich of these senses we have in mind, for their confusion may lead to unclarity\nregarding the differentiation of natural, artificial, and incidental causes. In\norder to avoid confusion, we have adopted the term explanatory  to refer to the\ngeneral sense in which both natural and artificial causes are contrasted with\nincidental causes because they are intrinsically (in virtue of what they are )\nrelated to their effects. We reserve the term intrinsic  specifically for the\nrelation which holds between a natural principle and its effect.\n\nOn our interpretation therefore, we may distinguish natural, artificial, and\nincidental causes with regards to three types of relations, namely (1) an\nexplanatory or incidental relation (2) a physical relation of internality or\nexternality, and (3) an intrinsic or extrinsic essential relation (see the table\nbelow).\n\n\n\nExplanatory / Incidental\n\nIntrinsic / Extrinsic\n\nInternal/ External\n\nChance\n\nIncidental\n\nExtrinsic\n\nEither\n\nArt\n\nExplanatory\n\nExtrinsic\n\nEither\n\nNature\n\nExplanatory\n\nIntrinsic\n\nInternal*\n\n\n\nNote that the physical location of causes is not, in and of itself, a\ndetermining factor in differentiating causes.

[81]  Johnson’s reason for identifying internal and explanatory\ncauses is most clearly laid out on p.202-203, where he cites a passage from De\nAnima  which establishes that self-movers cannot be moved by something else\nintrinsically, and that similarly, a process which is for the sake of an\nintrinsic final cause cannot occur for the sake of  an external good.\n\nAn animal may be pushed along by force but something that has been moved by\nitself included in its substance cannot be moved by something else except\ncoincidentally - just as what is intrinsically good because of itself cannot be\ngood because of something else or for the sake of something else. ( De An.  I 3,\n406 b8) [82]\n\n\n\nFrom this, Johnson infers that, since natural substances have intrinsic\npurposes, any other good they contribute to is incidental to them. On this view,\ninternal, natural, and explanatory causes are equivalent i.e. to have a nature\nis to have an internal cause, and this is the same as to say an explanatory\ncause; whereas all external causes are incidental, and thus scientifically\nirrelevant.\n--------\n\nGiven the new context, refine the summary.\nIf the context isn't useful, return the original summary.\n\nTotal output will be a summary of the article.\n\nSUMMARY:"

The author identifies the points of analogy and dis-analogy between craft and nature in her article \"Nature and Craft in Aristotelian Teleology.\" The five things which the craft analogy is meant to teach us about natural teleology include the species-specific character of artificial goal-directed processes, the role of form or structure in directing developmental processes, the importance of internal movement in explanation, the limitations of external factors in determining outcome, and the unity of nature.\n\nBelow you find a portion of the article:\n--------\nNotice the point of disanalogy suggested by the last sentence, which contrasts\nthe essential relation which holds between patient and agent in both cases.\nWhile craft uses fire as an instrument i.e.  as something different from itself,\nnature “uses it as a material as well”. This suggests, as we argued in our\nintroduction, that natural change is characterized – and differentiated from\ncraft –with regards to the intrinsic   relation of agent and patient.  Let us\nrecall however that although artificial causes are not intrinsic, they are, like\nnatural causes, essentially related to their effect in the general sense that\nthey are explanatory rather than incidental causes. In this resides the second\n[98]  point of analogy highlighted by Broadie. She notes that many goal-directed\n activities are incidental to the agent ; she mentions for instance   going to\nthe neighbor's house to inquire about recent news ,  an activity which does not\nbelong to man  in virtue of what he is . She highlights the fact that t he\ncognitive faculties which make  this activity  possible ( e.g.  language and\nsocial skills) are not meant directly or primarily  for this  activity.  In\nshort, gossiping is only a  possible use of th ese  facult ies, and thus\nconstitutes an incidental end of man.  By contrast ,  the cognitive faculties\nwhich allow a craftsman to practice his art are essentially related to the\nproduction of a specific artifact. Broadie argues that Aristotle deliberately\nestablishes the comparison with craft instead of other goal-directed activities\nbecause he wants to emphasize the explanatory character of natural causes. [99]\n This second point of analogy thus reemphasizes what the first one established,\nnamely that goal-directedness must be understood in relation to the nature of\nspecific beings.\n--------\n\nGiven the new context, refine the summary.\nIf the context isn't useful, return the original summary.\n\nTotal output will be a summary of the article.\n\nSUMMARY:"

  "text": "For an  artificial teleologist  like Anaxagoras, the good is not a cause in its\nown right, it is rather a character of the moving cause; things are moved\ntowards their respective ends because of a good  or well   intentioned\n efficient cause. This is why, although he recognized that some of his\npredecessors [122]  had foreseen the need to resort to the good to explain the\norder and beauty of nature, Aristotle did not consider them to have developed an\nadequate understanding of the way in which the good is a cause.

On Aristotle’s account, by contrast , deliberation is not the only, nor the\nprimar y  means of realizing an en d.   At the root of Aristotle’s critique of\nhis predecessor’s teleological accounts is their inversion of the order of\npriority between nature and the arts [124]  which results in their failure to\ngrasp the nature of goal-directedness. Let us insist that the mistake is not the\nattempt to understand natural goal-directedness in light of craft, nor is it the\nphysical externality of the mover which is entailed by their teleological views.\n[125]  Rather, his critique concerns their mistaken view of the direction of the\ncraft analogy and the psychological conception of final causes that this\nentails.\n\n\n\n\nNATURALIZING TECHNE\n\nAs a concluding thought for this chapter, we would like to suggest that\nreestablishing the right order of priority between techne  and physis  is what\nmakes the Aristotelian use of craft analogies more enlightening than that of\nartificial teleologists; for it allows us to perfect our understanding of b oth\nnature – by relying on the crafts whose essence is more knowable for us  – a nd\ncrafts – by identifying the true cause of their goal-directedness. If artificial\nteleologists can be accused of developing an artificial view of nature ;\n Aristotle  by contrast could be said to have developed a natural view of the\narts. To clarify what this means, let us take a brief look at Aristotle’s\ndiscussion of the art of accumulating wealth, in the first book of the Politics\n. The development of the argument throughout chapters 8-12 of book I of the\nPolitics  can be summarized as follows. First, Aristotle establishes the\nrelation between an animal’s natural needs and its way of life :"

( Pol . I 8, 1256 b25 ) [126]  \n\n\n\nThe way in which an animal provides for itself is grounded in its nature – e.g.\n its hunting habits are derived from  its nutritional needs, which are\ndetermined by its nature. Then, he extends this logic to the case of humans.\nDifferent arts are meant for satisfying our natural needs in ways appropriate to\nour nature – both in quantity and quality. Afterwards, he  establishes that the\npurposes  of acquisitive art s are natural  when they   are grounded  in the\nessence of human communities ( e.g. the family or the  city ) just as the\nnatural needs of a given animal determines the nature of its feeding habits.\n[127]  Then, in the 9th chapter, he contrasts these natural arts of acquisition\nwith the unnatural arts of acquiring riches for the sake of  accumulating\nwealth. The reason why this second kind of acquisitive art is unnatural is that\nits purpose is not borrowed from nature. Aristotle later implies that such arts,\nwhose ends are arbitrary, are not genuine  instances of the acquisitive arts\nwhen he says about their natural counterpart that “These are the divisions of\nthe true or proper art  of wealth-getting and come first.”   ( Pol. I 9 1158\nb20) [128]   The second class of acquisitive arts are not ‘true or proper’\nbecause they are not grounded in nature. The following passage clearly indicates\nthat Aristotle considers them to be arts only by name because their purposes,\nnot being grounded in natural ones, are in a sense not ‘true purposes’ :\n\nOthers [129]  maintain that coined money is a mere sham, a thing not natural,\nbut conventional only, because, if the users substitute another commodity for\nit, it is worthless, and because it is not useful as a means to any of the\nnecessities of life, and, indeed, he who is rich in coin may often be in want of\nnecessary food. But how can that be wealth of which a man may have a great\nabundance and yet perish with hunger, like Midas in the fable whose insatiable\nprayer turned everything that was set before him into gold? ( Pol . I 9 1257\nb12-16) [130]\n--------\n\nGiven the new context, refine the summary.\nIf the context isn't useful, return the original summary.\n\nTotal output will be a summary of the article.\n\nSUMMARY:"

Byrne [146]  rightly emphasizes\nthe similarity between Aristotle’s portrayal of the relation of material and\nformal principles in natural and artificial contexts; [147]  and argues that, if\nAristotle considered artifacts to be mere heaps (with a shape rather than a\nform) he would not rely on examples taken from craft to teach us about\ncomposition. Indeed the constitution of heaps is, as we have said, a case of\n‘bottom-up’ composition which results in the mere appearance of being and unity.\n In short, Aristotle’s use of craft analogies in this context is yet another\nindication that Aristotle indeed considers artifacts to be more than aggregates.\n--------\n\nGiven the new context, refine the summary.\nIf the context isn't useful, return the original summary.\n\nTotal output will be a summary of the article.\n\nSUMMARY:"

We have said\nthat Aristotle considers nature to be an inner   principle of motion, and that\nthings which are naturally constituted are moved towards their end by an\nintrinsic cause. We said that this should not be understood merely in a physical\nsense , as the intrinsic character of final causes is due to their identity with\nthe formal cause of the substance undergoing the change. Thus natural\nteleological accounts constitute explanations of how substances are moved\ntowards their end, which is their state of completion “For those things are\nnatural which, by a continuous movement originated from an internal principle,\narrive at some completion” ( Ph.  II 8, 199 b15). [156]  This state of\ncompletion constitutes both their formal and final cause because the form, given\nits essential identity with the   final cause, acts   as   the end of the\ncontinuous movement. Consequently, we have argued that teleological explanations\nare rooted in the nature of specific beings, and that  purposes should be\nunderstood ontologically, not psychologically. We have shown that this is so\neven in the case of the arts on Aristotle’s account. We have said, for instance,\nthat health (which is not an arbitrary goal, but a pre-existing end which is\ndetermined by the nature of the human organism) is the telos  of the medical art\nwhether a particular doctor desires to produce it or not. Thus purposiveness as\nit is found in the arts is either an imitation, or a completion of a specific\nnatural self-actualization process. [157]   We have said that i n completing and\nimitating nature, the goal of the artist is determined by, and cannot be\nunderstood apart from natural ends.   Through these considerations, we have\noffered an alternative to the dichotomous view of nature and the arts defended\nby Johnson and others. We have highlighted the subordination of artificial\ngoal-directedness to natural teleology, and consequently have shown them to be\nintimately related. [158]   We have also provided an alternative to a common\nview of Aristotle’s objection to his predecessor’s teleological principles\nwhich, we have said, does not lie in the fact that they established an analogy\nbetween natural and artificial goal-directedness.

We have said\nthat Aristotle considers nature to be an inner   principle of motion, and that\nthings which are naturally constituted are moved towards their end by an\nintrinsic cause. We said that this should not be understood merely in a physical\nsense , as the intrinsic character of final causes is due to their identity with\nthe formal cause of the substance undergoing the change. Thus natural\nteleological accounts constitute explanations of how substances are moved\ntowards their end, which is their state of completion “For those things are\nnatural which, by a continuous movement originated from an internal principle,\narrive at some completion” ( Ph.  II 8, 199 b15). [156]  This state of\ncompletion constitutes both their formal and final cause because the form, given\nits essential identity with the   final cause, acts   as   the end of the\ncontinuous movement. Consequently, we have argued that teleological explanations\nare rooted in the nature of specific beings, and that  purposes should be\nunderstood ontologically, not psychologically. We have shown that this is so\neven in the case of the arts on Aristotle’s account. We have said, for instance,\nthat health (which is not an arbitrary goal, but a pre-existing end which is\ndetermined by the nature of the human organism) is the telos  of the medical art\nwhether a particular doctor desires to produce it or not. Thus purposiveness as\nit is found in the arts is either an imitation, or a completion of a specific\nnatural self-actualization process. [157]   We have said that i n completing and\nimitating nature, the goal of the artist is determined by, and cannot be\nunderstood apart from natural ends.   Through these considerations, we have\noffered an alternative to the dichotomous view of nature and the arts defended\nby Johnson and others. We have highlighted the subordination of artificial\ngoal-directedness to natural teleology, and consequently have shown them to be\nintimately related. [158]   We have also provided an alternative to a common\nview of Aristotle’s objection to his predecessor’s teleological principles\nwhich, we have said, does not lie in the fact that they established an analogy\nbetween natural and artificial goal-directedness.

  "text": "With regards to the first question, some scholars [164]  have highlighted\ninstances of instrumental relations which are presupposed by Aristotle’s\nintrinsic   teleological accounts such as the use of nutrients in digestion or\nthe way the body uses elements to constitute its tissues and organs, etc. [165]\n  A plant is no more intrinsically inclined to contribute to the nutrition and\ngrowth of the animal which eats it than is the water in the eye inwardly\ndirected to the realization of sight. In these and similar cases, a natural\nsubstance instrumentalizes  another, not for the sake of  realizing an arbitrary\nfantasy, but in order to actualize its nature. This undermines the strictly\ninternalist view of nature because it means that at least some natural\nsubstances cannot actualize their nature ‘on their own’. [166]   The fact that\nwe find accounts of instrumental relations in Aristotle’s biological works\nsuggests that he considered that the externality entailed by such relations can\nbe reconciled with the internality which characterizes natural change. However,\nit remains for us to clarify the nature of this reconciliation. We have briefly\naddressed this topic in the introduction, [167]  but will now provide a more\ncomprehensive analysis and address some questions raised by our preliminary\nanswer.\n\nFirst, it will be useful to delineate the scope of our present inquiry. Some of\nthe instrumentalization processes identified  by the scholars  mentioned above\n raise questions regarding relations at higher levels of organization ( e.g. wi\nthin households, cities, animal communities, etc.) While these questions are\nworthy of consideration, given the purpose of the present chapter, it will be\nsufficient to restrict our attention to cases of instrumentalization involved in\nthe functioning of middle-sized organisms  such as plants and animals. [168]\n The following investigation will be centered on the relation between natural\nsubstances and their constitutive elements. We will argue that part-whole\nrelations within natural substances are not always strictly intrinsic on\nAristotle’s account, and that consequently, his view of natural change does in\nfact involve instrumentalization.\n\n\n\n\nTHE APORIA"

[174]  While her approach is interesting in many respects,  it is\nlimited first in that it rests on a confusion of matter (a kind of being) and\nmaterial causes (a role played by determinate beings) [175]  and second , in\nthat it creates a tension with the way in which Aristotle speaks of the elements\nin other contexts. Indeed, the opening passage of VII 16 reads “earth and fire\nand air; for none of them is a unity, but as it were  a mere heap, till they are\nworked up and some unity is made of them” , [176]   thus  if Peterson is right\nthat, in this passage, Aristotle is teaching us about the ‘kind of being’ that\nthe elements are, then it contradicts the accounts we find in the treatises on\nMeteorology and Physics for instance, where the elements are by no means\npresented as mere heaps. In what follows, we will suggest that potentiality\nshould be understood as a relational property rather than an intrinsic character\nof material causes. If we adopt this view, Aristotle’s characterization of the\nelements in these different contexts entails no contradiction for the same\nreason that there is no contradiction involved in calling an object big and\nsmall, when considered from different perspectives. Simply, qua material\nprinciple (which is how they are treated in Metaph. VII 16), Aristotle considers\nthe elements to be akin to a heap in need to be unified, but qua  substance,\nthey are unified and goal-directed beings. Thus it appears that the two\nlimitations of Peterson’s perspective are intimately related, for the confusion\nof the relative indeterminacy of the elements qua  material cause with their\ninherent nature rests on the failure to distinguish properly between matter and\nmaterial causes.\n\n\n\n\nNEUTRALISM\n--------\n\nGiven the new context, refine the summary.\nIf the context isn't useful, return the original summary.\n\nTotal output will be a summary of the article.\n\nSUMMARY:"

  "text": "THE INDEPENDENCE OF MATERIAL CAUSES\n\nAccordingly, Byrne argues that Aristotle’s account of the role played by\nmaterial causes entails that they preserve their integrity and independence,\nthus he challenges the traditional view which reduces material causes to ‘pure\npotentiality’. [206]  In order to explain and overcome this (mis)understanding\nof Aristotle’s perspective, Byrne first distinguishes between matter  (physical\nstuff) and material causes (that out of which something is made), and clarifies\nin what sense the latter can be called ‘potential’. [207]  He explains that\nmaterial causes are not ‘a kind of thing’ with definite properties, i.e.  being\na material cause does not   mean ‘being material’ in the sense of being\nsomething physical. Rather, being a material cause means standing in a certain\nrelation to something else; it “describes a job, rather than the thing that\nperforms that job.” [208]   Broadly speaking, something is a material cause if\nsomething else can be made from it. Byrne notes that Aristotle does not always\nresort to physical examples for illustrating the role of material causes. He\ngives, for instance, the example of the letters of the alphabet out of which\nsyllables are made. By contrast, to be something material (to be matter, or made\nof matter) means to have definite properties “to be matter  in the sense of\nphysical stuff is to possess certain intrinsic, non-relational properties, such\nas being extended, divisible, movable, and so forth.” [209]    \n\nHaving established this distinction, Byrne clarifies in what qualified  sense\nmaterial causes may be called potential . He argues that although matter has a\nnature, and is in no sense ‘pure potentiality’, [210]  material causes are\npotential   in one respect, namely in relation to  a compound. He insists,\nhowever, that in order to be able to play the role it is assigned, the material\ncause of a hylomorphic compound must have definite properties in its own right.\nIn other words, although it is potential in one respect , considered  in itself\nthe material cause must be something actual. For instance, although the bronze\nconsidered qua  material cause is potentially a statue, qua bronze it is\nactually something determinate. In fact, Byrne argues, it is precisely because\nit is actually bronze, that it can act as the material cause of the statue; to\nbe potentially  a statue means being actually  hard, malleable, and a series of\nother things."

The difficulty lies in grounding the unity of composite substances. On Byrne's account, there is no fundamental difference between the relation of formal and material principles in natural substances and artifacts. The material cause of a natural body is just as independent as that of an artifact; with the only difference that \"the formal causes of natural substances impose greater demands on their material causes.\" The unity of natural substances only differs from that of artifacts in that the formal principle makes \"greater demands\" on the material principle, because unlike artificial forms, natural forms have to be instantiated in very precise materials, and the specific requirements apply at many levels of composition. However, it is unclear why the mere fact that natural forms make 'greater demands' on their material cause can, in and of itself, ground the claim that natural substances are more unified than artifacts.\n\nIndividuality:\nThe article does not provide information about individuality.\n\nBelow you find a portion of the article:\n--------\nINDIVIDUALITY\n\nAnother  difficulty which faces Byrne’s perspective is the tension it creates\nwith Aristotle’s explicit assertion (in chapters 13 and 16 of Metaphysics VII)\n[223]  that no substance is composed of substances . This second difficulty is\nmore delicate and an adequate answer would demand an exhaustive discussion of\nthe middle books of the Metaphysics . While it is beyond the scope of this paper\nto provide such an answer, we may say this much in order to overcome the\napparent tension; first , we may note that both passages concern a specific view\nof composition; and do not necessarily apply to all conceivable ways for\nsubstances to enter into a compositional relation. The argument in VII 16 is\ndirected at the Platonists, and concerns the possibility for substances to be\ncomposed of substances that are   actual  in the same respect  (e.g. for the\nhorse itself to be the substance of particular horses).

In line with this, let us recall Peterson’s insight\nconcerning the polysemy of the notions of being and unity.

    "You are an expert in summarizing classical philosophy articles.\nYour goal is to create a summary of an article.\nWe have provided an existing summary up to a certain point: \nThe article critiques Aristotelian teleology by challenging the dichotomous conception of natural and artificial causes. The author examines Aristotle's understanding of explanatory and incidental causes, discussing his concept of composition and the value of food and artifacts. They argue that artifacts are more than mere aggregates and have being and unity qua artifact. The article discusses Aristotle's philosophy of matter, which distinguishes between functional and compositional parts. Functional parts are quasi-substances whose form and final principles are defined in relation to the whole they constitute, while compositional parts exist independently of the body they compose and have their own formal and final causes. The relation between natural substances and their compositional parts is best described as quasi-intrinsic. The limitations of the strictly intrinsic view are discussed, specifically eliminativism and neutralism. The article suggests that it is not necessary to deny the composite nature of substances in order to escape materialism; one only needs to assert that the material constituents are not a sufficient explanation of the nature of the higher substance. Furthermore, the article contends that for Aristotle, potentiality does not allow for the notion of 'pure' or 'unqualified' potentiality. Instead, actuality is primary in multiple ways: first, it is prior to potentiality 'in formula', and secondly, it is first in time. Potentiality is limited and determined by actuality on both ends, meaning that to be potentially x means being actually something capable of embodying the form of x and being informed by a substance which is actually x.\n\nThe article denies that the potential existence of elements in homogeneous mixtures entails their destruction. Instead, it suggests that the intermediary properties of the tissue are due to the persistence of the elements through generation. Byrne conceives of combination as a middle ground between simple aggregation and transmutation, allowing for specific contributions of elements to the nature of the compound. However, it is unclear why the mere fact that natural forms make 'greater demands' on their material cause can, in and of itself, ground the claim that natural substances are more unified than artifacts.\n\nThe article notes that both passages in Aristotle's Metaphysics VII concerning the possibility for substances to be composed of substances that are actual in the same respect apply only to specific views of composition and not necessarily to all conceivable ways for substances to enter into a compositional relation. It suggests that the conclusion of the passage should be understood in the restricted sense that two substances existing at the same level of organization cannot be in a compositional relation. The article notes that unity and multiplicity are only in tension if attributed to the same thing in the same respect, suggesting that Aristotle's rejection of the Platonic view of composition does not a priori contradict the view that the instrumentalization of material elements by higher-level organisms presuppose rather than destroy the nature of these lower-level substances.\n\nBelow you find a portion of the article:\n--------\nNATURAL USE\n\nA nother question raised by the extrinsic view is whether the contribution of\ncompositional matter to the self-actualization of organized bodies can be called\nnatural. We have established in our introduction that the distinction between\nnatural and artificial processes is that in nature, agent and patient are one ;\nwhereas in art, they are distinct . Consequently, it is legitimate to ask how\nthe instrumentalization of the elements by the body can be natural if they are\ndistinct entities. In other words, the question is how to avoid saying that the\nbody is ‘practicing a craft’ when, for instance, it uses water for the sake of\n sight in tissue formation. Simply, if we are to adopt the view that the\nelements preserve their nature upon entering the constitution of the body, we\nmust come up with a way to differentiate between natural and artificial\ninstrumental relations. It is indeed, at first sight, unclear why for instance\nthe appropriation of matter through nutrition is a natural process, while the\nuse of materials in tool fabrication is artificial. In both cases, the patient\nis moved by a distinct entity, and made to serve an end which does not, strictly\nspeaking, belong to it in virtue of what it is. The common sense answer to our\nquestion is that natural and artificial use   may be distinguished with respect\nto the need for deliberation. Let us start our examination with this\n preliminary answer, for Aristotle’s view rarely (if ever) violates common\nsense.\n--------\n\nGiven the new context, refine the summary.\nIf the context isn't useful, return the original summary.\n\nTotal output will be a summary of the article.\n\nSUMMARY:"

In fact, let us notice that he does not say ‘if the craftsman was in the\nwood’. We can easily imagine what it would mean for the craftsman (the efficient\ncause) to be physically in the wood, but what does it mean for the craft to be\nin the wood? It is plausible to think that it means something like this: ‘if the\nnature of the craft and that of the wood were more intimately related’, i.e. if\nthe boat and its formal principle were  one , as a living body and its soul are\none.  This is the answer suggested by an analogous thought experiment found in\nbook II of De Anima:\n\nThe soul is a substance in accord with the account.

II 8, 199\nb27) . [227]  If the craft was ‘in the wood’, the generation of boats would not\nrequire the deliberation of an artist. But  what would it mean for the craft to\nbe in the wood? We have said that Aristotle, when he describes nature as an\ninner principle of motion, does not only   mean a physical kind of internality,\nthus we should not understand him to mean ‘if the craft was physically in the\nwood’. In fact, let us notice that he does not say ‘if the craftsman was in the\nwood’. We can easily imagine what it would mean for the craftsman (the efficient\ncause) to be physically in the wood, but what does it mean for the craft to be\nin the wood? It is plausible to think that it means something like this: ‘if the\nnature of the craft and that of the wood were more intimately related’, i.e. if\nthe boat and its formal principle were  one , as a living body and its soul are\none.  This is the answer suggested by an analogous thought experiment found in\nbook II of De Anima:\n\nThe soul is a substance in accord with the account. And this is the essence of\nthis sort of body. It is just like this: if an instrument – for example, an axe\n – were a natural body, its substance would be the being for the axe , and this\nwould be its soul. ( De An . II 1, 412 b12-14) [228]  \n\n\n\nIt follows that, in natural instrumentalization processes, there is a sense in\nwhich agent and patient, although differentiated in some respect, are\nnonetheless one . Let us invoke once again the passage of the treatise on\nRespiration  where Aristotle contrasts the way in which craft and nature use\n fire: “ while the crafts use the fire merely as an instrument, nature uses it\nas a material as well”  ( Resp.  485 a30-b5). [229]  Although he does not\nelaborate on what this distinction entails, what he says afterwards suggests\nthat he means to say that the natural use of  fire involves a certain ‘fusion’\n(combination)  with the natural body ;\n--------\n\nGiven the new context, refine the summary.\nIf the context isn't useful, return the original summary.\n\nTotal output will be a summary of the article.\n\nSUMMARY:"

    "You are an expert in summarizing classical philosophy articles.\nYour goal is to create a summary of an article.\nWe have provided an existing summary up to a certain point: The article critiques Aristotelian teleology by challenging the dichotomous conception of natural and artificial causes. The author examines Aristotle's understanding of explanatory and incidental causes, discussing his concept of composition and the value of food and artifacts. They argue that artifacts are more than mere aggregates and have being and unity qua artifact. The article discusses Aristotle's philosophy of matter, which distinguishes between functional and compositional parts. Functional parts are quasi-substances whose form and final principles are defined in relation to the whole they constitute, while compositional parts exist independently of the body they compose and have their own formal and final causes. The relation between natural substances and their compositional parts is best described as quasi-intrinsic. The limitations of the strictly intrinsic view are discussed, specifically eliminativism and neutralism. The article suggests that it is not necessary to deny the composite nature of substances in order to escape materialism; one only needs to assert that the material constituents are not a sufficient explanation of the nature of the higher substance. Furthermore, the article contends that for Aristotle, potentiality does not allow for the notion of 'pure' or 'unqualified' potentiality. Instead, actuality is primary in multiple ways: first, it is prior to potentiality 'in formula', and secondly, it is first in time. Potentiality is limited and determined by actuality on both ends, meaning that to be potentially x means being actually something capable of embodying the form of x and being informed by a substance which is actually x.\nThe article denies that the potential existence of elements in homogeneous mixtures entails their destruction. Instead, it suggests that the intermediary properties of the tissue are due to the persistence of the elements through generation. Byrne conceives of combination as a middle ground between simple aggregation and transmutation, allowing for specific contributions of elements to the nature of the compound. However, it is unclear why the mere fact that natural forms make 'greater demands' on their material cause can, in and of itself, ground the claim that natural substances are more unified than artifacts.\nThe article notes that both passages in Aristotle's Metaphysics VII concerning the possibility for substances to be composed of substances that are actual in the same respect apply only to specific views of composition and not necessarily to all conceivable ways for substances to enter into a compositional relation. It suggests that the conclusion of the passage should be understood in the restricted sense that two substances existing at the same level of organization cannot be in a compositional relation. The article notes that unity and multiplicity are only in tension if attributed to the same thing in the same respect, suggesting that Aristotle's rejection of the Platonic view of composition does not a priori contradict the view that the instrumentalization of material elements by higher-level organisms presuppose rather than destroy the nature of these lower-level substances.\nFinally, the article examines the question of natural use and how it can be distinguished from artificial use. It notes that natural and artificial use may be distinguished with respect to the need for deliberation. The common sense answer is that natural and artificial use are distinguished based on whether deliberation is required. If an action requires deliberation, it is considered artificial use. On the other hand, if an action does not require deliberation, it is considered natural use.\n\nBelow you find a portion of the article:\n--------\nDistinguishing between artificial and natural instrumentalization processes with\nregards to the need for deliberation is not a complete answer, for we must then\nface a further question; what grounds the need for deliberation in the case of\nartificial processes?  If water is no more intrinsically directed towards the\nformation of an eye than is the wood towards the formation of a boat, why is it\nthat eyes come into existence without craftsmen deliberating, but boats do not?\nIn book II of the Physics,  Aristotle says that “If the ship-building art were\nin the wood, it would produce the same result by nature.”   ( P h .

    "You are an expert in summarizing classical philosophy articles.\nYour goal is to create a summary of an article.\nWe have provided an existing summary up to a certain point: This article critiques Aristotelian teleology by challenging the dichotomous conception of natural and artificial causes. The author examines Aristotle's understanding of explanatory and incidental causes, discussing his concept of composition and the value of food and artifacts. They argue that artifacts are more than mere aggregates and have being and unity qua artifact. The article discusses Aristotle's philosophy of matter, which distinguishes between functional and compositional parts. Functional parts are quasi-substances whose form and final principles are defined in relation to the whole they constitute, while compositional parts exist independently of the body they compose and have their own formal and final causes. The relation between natural substances and their compositional parts is best described as quasi-intrinsic. The limitations of the strictly intrinsic view are discussed, specifically eliminativism and neutralism. The article suggests that it is not necessary to deny the composite nature of substances in order to escape materialism; one only needs to assert that the material constituents are not a sufficient explanation of the nature of the higher substance. Furthermore, the article examines the question of natural use and how it can be distinguished from artificial use. It notes that natural and artificial use may be distinguished with respect to the need for deliberation. The common sense answer is that natural and artificial use are distinguished based on whether deliberation is required. However, the author argues that this is not enough to ground the claim that natural substances are more unified than artifacts. They suggest that the unity of a natural substance is due to its being 'informated by a substance which is actually x'. The article notes that unity and multiplicity are only in tension if attributed to the same thing in the same respect, suggesting that Aristotle's rejection of the Platonic view of composition does not a priori contradict the view that the instrumentalization of material elements by higher-level organisms presuppose rather than destroy the nature of these lower-level substances. The article examines a thought experiment found in book II of De Anima where the soul is said to be 'one' with the body it animates, suggesting that in natural instrumentalization processes, there is a sense in which agent and patient, although differentiated in some respect, are nonetheless one.\n\nBelow you find a portion of the article:\n--------\nf or this is no longer a function either of fire or of breath, so it is\nremarkable that we should find such a faculty combined with these two bodies.\nAgain with regard to soul we find the same cause of wonder, for it must be\nassumed in the functions of these two, and therefore there is some sense in\nreferring to the same agent – either generally or to some particular creative\npart – the fact that its motion always operates in the same way; for nature,\nfrom which they are generated, is always constant. ( Resp . 485 b11-16 ) [230]\n\n\n\nThis suggests that the distinction between use ‘as instrument’ and use ‘as\nmaterial’ is that in the first case, agent and patient remain distinct whereas\nin the second, the agent ‘assimilates’ [231]  the patient, and as a result   “\nthere is some sense in referring to the same agent” .   Thus , when a natural\nsubstance uses fire as material , although agent and patient can be\ndifferentiated in some respects, there is also a sense in which they are the\nsame. This, we suggest, means that the formal, final and efficient causes of the\nnatural substance (its soul) should not be called the extrinsic, nor even the\nquasi-extrinsic cause of the changes it imparts in fire. We suggest that in such\na case, the relation of agent and patient is best described as quasi-intrinsic.\nTo clarify what this means, it may be useful to consider the way in which\nindividual humans are said to be parts of a family; there is a sense in which\nthe individual members are  the family – the family is not a distinct substance\nexisting besides its members – and for this reason, the relation of the\nindividual members to the family cannot be strictly extrinsic; yet they remain\nindividuals with an integrity, a nature, a purpose of their own, thus their\nrelation to the whole cannot be strictly intrinsic either.\n\nSimply, we suggest that, although compositional parts have a certain level of\nindependence, within the context of composition they do not exist as an entirely\ndistinct entity.

    "You are an expert in summarizing classical philosophy articles.\nYour goal is to create a summary of an article.\nWe have provided an existing summary up to a certain point: \nThe article critiques Aristotelian teleology by challenging the dichotomous conception of natural and artificial causes. The author examines Aristotle's understanding of explanatory and incidental causes, discussing his concept of composition and the value of food and artifacts. They argue that artifacts are more than mere aggregates and have being and unity qua artifact. The article discusses Aristotle's philosophy of matter, which distinguishes between functional and compositional parts. Functional parts are quasi-substances whose form and final principles are defined in relation to the whole they constitute, while compositional parts exist independently of the body they compose and have their own formal and final causes. The relation between natural substances and their compositional parts is best described as quasi-intrinsic. The limitations of the strictly intrinsic view are discussed, specifically eliminativism and neutralism. The article suggests that it is not necessary to deny the composite nature of substances in order to escape materialism; one only needs to assert that the material constituents are not a sufficient explanation of the nature of the higher substance. Furthermore, the article examines the question of natural use and how it can be distinguished from artificial use. It notes that natural and artificial use may be distinguished with respect to the need for deliberation. However, the author argues that this is not enough to ground the claim that natural substances are more unified than artifacts. They suggest that the unity of a natural substance is due to its being 'informated by a substance which is actually x'. The article examines a thought experiment found in book II of De Anima where the soul is said to be 'one' with the body it animates, suggesting that in natural instrumentalization processes, there is a sense in which agent and patient, although differentiated in some respects, are nonetheless one.\n\nThe most significant difficulty for the extrinsic view arises from the fact that the telos of natural substances does not belong to the elements in virtue of what they are, and thus may be said to constitute for them an incidental end.

    "You are an expert in summarizing classical philosophy articles.\nYour goal is to create a summary of an article.\nWe have provided an existing summary up to a certain point: \nThe article critiques Aristotelian teleology by challenging the dichotomous conception of natural and artificial causes. The author examines Aristotle's understanding of explanatory and incidental causes, discussing his concept of composition and the value of food and artifacts. They argue that artifacts are more than mere aggregates and have being and unity qua artifact. The article discusses Aristotle's philosophy of matter, which distinguishes between functional and compositional parts. Functional parts are quasi-substances whose form and final principles are defined in relation to the whole they constitute, while compositional parts exist independently of the body they compose and have their own formal and final causes. The relation between natural substances and their compositional parts is best described as quasi-intrinsic. The limitations of the strictly intrinsic view are discussed, specifically eliminativism and neutralism. The article suggests that it is not necessary to deny the composite nature of substances in order to escape materialism; one only needs to assert that the material constituents are not a sufficient explanation of the nature of the higher substance. Furthermore, the article examines the question of natural use and how it can be distinguished from artificial use. It notes that natural and artificial use may be distinguished with respect to the need for deliberation. However, the author argues that this is not enough to ground the claim that natural substances are more unified than artifacts. They suggest that the unity of a natural substance is due to its being 'informated by a substance which is actually x'. The article examines a thought experiment found in book II of De Anima where the soul is said to be 'one' with the body it animates, suggesting that in natural instrumentalization processes, there is a sense in which agent and patient, although differentiated in some respects, are nonetheless one.\n\nThe most significant difficulty for the extrinsic view arises from the fact that the telos of natural substances does not belong to the elements in virtue of what they are, and thus may be said to constitute for them an incidental end. Because Aristotelian science is not concerned with incidental causes, it becomes a question whether there can be a genuine teleological account of the contribution of constitutive parts to the self-actualization of natural substances. The issue is that, for instance, if the water which constitutes the eye tissues remains a distinct substance with its own formal and final principle, its contribution to sight is incidental to it, and a teleological account of its contribution to such an extrinsic and incidental end would be as scientifically irrelevant as an account of the motion of a horse which is being moved by a truck for the sake of a human end. This difficulty echoes an ongoing discussion within the scholarship concerning the explanatory value of hypothetical necessity. While Johnson and like-minded scholars avoid the difficulty by denying the independence of compositional parts i.e. treating them as functional parts; others emphasize the contrast between functional and compositional parts and treat the latter as completely distinct substances whose relation to the whole is strictly extrinsic. As a result, they must diminish or even deny the explanatory value of hypothetical necessity. Byrne, for instance, insists that it would be a mistake to explain the essential characters of the elements by appealing to the nature of the whole they constitute. He notes that while it is hypothetically necessary for eyes to be made out of something transparent, it is problematic to explain the transparency of water with respect to the nature of the eye; for one thing, water can constitute many other hylomorphic compounds or even exist on its own; and in all these cases, it is transparent. In order to avoid the mistake of explaining everything about compositional matter with reference to the nature of the composite, he emphasizes the former's independence and deprives hypothetical necessity of explanatory power. On his account, hypothetical necessity does not express a real causal dependance of the material and efficient causes that are being embodied; it is rather a description of the kind of material and efficient causes which are required to produce a good result non-accidentally. In this view, \"final causes are effects, not causes\". Although we share the concern regarding excessively broad teleological accounts which rob compositional matter of its integrity, we consider this reduction of the scope of teleological accounts to be excessive and problematic.\n\nBelow you find a portion of the article:\n--------\nHYPOTHETICAL AND CONDITIONAL NECESSITY\n\nNathanael Stein’s presentation of hypothetical necessity in his article  \nExplanation and Hypothetical Necessity  in Aristotle [236]   provides a\nrestricted account of the explanatory role of hypothetical necessity which can\nallow us to address Byrne’s concern while avoiding the equally problematic\nconfusion of functional and compositional parts. He distinguishes between\nnecessary conditions and hypothetical necessity i.e. between acting for the sake\nof , and merely contributing to  something. Simply while a number of conditions\ncontribute to the actualization of a given form, only those which actively\ncontribute to the process qua  ‘auxiliary cause’ (συναίτιον) [237]  are\nhypothetically necessary. This distinction allows him to maintain the\nexplanatory power of hypothetical necessity without making the nature of the\ncomposite whole responsible for explaining too much about the substances it\ninstrumentalizes . According to Stein, the tendency to undermine the explanatory\nvalue of hypothetical necessity arises from a failure to establish this\ndistinction. If one takes all the necessary conditions of realization of a given\ntelos  to be hypothetically necessary, then the scope of a single teleological\nexplanation becomes outrageously broad. Indeed, the necessary conditions for the\nrealization of any natural form   can ultimately be traced back all the way to\nthe very structure of the cosmos. [238]  Stein suggests that the relation of\nhypothetical necessity in fact expresses an explanatory relationship between the\nfinal and material principles of natural substances, and thus does not extend to\nall necessary conditions.

It suggests that artifacts have being and unity qua artifact, while functional parts are quasi-substances whose form and final principles are defined in relation to the whole they constitute. The material constituents are not a sufficient explanation of the nature of the higher substance. The article argues that hypothetical necessity is not a sufficient explanation of the essence of things and examines its relationship with natural use.

The article highlights the mistake of artificial teleologists in thinking that efficient causality is the only way for a good to cause anything. In conclusion, the article argues that a 'good' efficient cause is not a final cause according to Aristotle, and teleological explanations are rooted in the nature of the good result. Stein's account is easily reconciled with Aristotle's conception of final causes, and has the added benefit of allowing us to grant explanatory power to hypothetical necessity while avoiding to make a natural kind responsible for too much; for rooting hypothetical relations in the essence of the substances that are being actualized naturally limits the scope of what a given telos can explain. Something is hypothetically necessary when it is constitutive of a given capacity e.g., being hard is more than a 'necessary condition' of cutting, it is an integral part of the cutting capacity. This distinction in turn provides us with the means to distinguish between a 'result' and an end. In the Aristotelian perspective, it is incorrect to say that the bird developed webbed feet, then he could walk in the marsh. Rather, we should say that since the bird is a marsh dweller, then the developmental process of his feet is such. The end (marsh dwelling or living a marsh-dwelller's life) is not a mere result but rather the end which renders the bird's developmental process hypothetically necessary."

  "text": "SUMMARY\n\nThroughout this chapter we have attempted to show that the contribution of\ncompositional parts to the self-actualization of natural substances can be\ndescribed as an instrumentalization process because there is a sense in which\npart and whole are distinct. We have insisted that this distinction must be\nunderstood in a restricted sense, for conceiving of part-whole relations in\nextrinsic terms undermines the relation of hypothetical necessity as Aristotle\nunderstands it. Through showing the limitations of both the intrinsic and\nextrinsic views, we have attempted to highlight the need to adopt a balanced\nperspective which does justice to the integrity of compositional matter while\nalso recognizing its (relative) identity with the hylomorphic compound.\nConcretely, our view entails that the water which makes up the eye tissue is not\ndestroyed, and that insofar as it is ensouled  (used as material) it   is the\neye tissue, it is not merely ‘contained’ by the eye, as is the water in wet\nwool. [250]  We have tried to show that this view – which we call\nquasi-intrinsic – best aligns with Aristotle’s balanced perspective on the unity\nof hylomorphic compounds; for the strictly intrinsic view overlooks the\nplurality of substance, whereas the extrinsic view overemphasizes it .

The article also differentiates between use as tool and use as material, arguing that instrumentalization processes contribute to a specific self-actualization process without appealing to unnatural or extrinsic schemes of explanation.\n\nThe scope of Aristotelian teleology is not limited to the internal functioning of organisms, but rather extends to beings at higher levels of organization. The article argues that rain and plants are parts of a functional whole whose nature accounts for their mutually beneficial relations, and that the question of whether rain exists exclusively for the sake of plants should be reformulated in ontological terms.\n\nThe article contends that this formulation of the question allows one to move past the confines of a strict dichotomy between global teleology and individualism. It proposes an organic global teleological perspective, which unifies the specifically distinct ends of natural substances through their common directedness towards achieving and maintaining the form of the overarching entity they constitute. This perspective presents an exciting opportunity for meaningful engagement with the different branches of ecology, as it entails that individual organisms can be studied not only in isolation but also as parts of a goal-directed whole that exists at higher levels of organization.\n\nBelow you find a portion of the article:\n--------\nNATURE BEYOND ORGANISMS\n\nBecause Aristotle has not left us a treatise on ecology, the discussion requires\nsome level of speculation. [261]  Aristotle’s silence on this question has led\nmany to the conclusion that he was not interested in ecological studies, or even\nthat his views on nature are, by principle, incompatible with the\npresuppositions of ecology. [262]  A first thing worth noting – something which\neven advocates of the global interpretation often fail to acknowledge – is that\ngiven the subject matter of Aristotle’s biological treatises, [263]  we should\nnot expect him to discuss the functions of animals and plants in the\nhigher-level organization of the natural world, even if he did consider nature\nto be organized higher up, for the same reason that an anatomy textbook written\nby a biologist today would not include discussions of the ecological niche of\nthe organisms under analysis. In both cases, it is the nature of the inquiry\nwhich explains the omission rather than a principled opposition to ecology on\nthe part of the author. [264]  Thus we suggest it is a mistake to attempt to\nground an argument for the extension of teleology beyond living organisms in the\n– very few – “ecological remarks” found in the works on nature such as those\nwhich mention the location of the mouths of dolphins, [265]  or the relation of\nrain and crop growth. [266]  We contend that this is not the best avenue first\n because these passages are not meant to address this question [267]  and second\n because there are much more relevant texts in the Metaphysics , Nicomachean\nEthics, and most importantly in the Politics,  where Aristotle does provide\nteleological accounts of the functional organization of nature at higher levels\nof organization.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FAMILY EXISTS BY NATURE\n--------\n\nGiven the new context, refine the summary.\nIf the context isn't useful, return the original summary.\n\nTotal output will be a summary of the article.\n\nSUMMARY:"

  "text": "THE FAMILY EXISTS BY NATURE\n\nThe Politics  opens with the remark that “ Every state is a community of some\nkind, and every community is established with a view to some good” ( Pol.

To call the community goal-directed entails that it has a nature. [269]\n In the first chapter of book I of the Politics , it is already apparent that\nAristotle considers the family and the state to have genuine being  and unity ,\ni.e.  to be something more than an aggregate of beings.

(...)\nthe  proof that the state is a creation of nature and prior to the individual is\nthat the individual, when isolated, is not self sufficing ; and therefore he is\nlike a part in relation to the whole. But he who is unable to live in society,\nor who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast\nor a god; he is no part  of a state. ( Pol . I 2, 1253 a20-35) [271]"

  "text": "Apart from the ‘acceptability’ of the view defended by Aristotle in the Politics\n, Johnson’s concern is exactly what we would expect, namely that ascribing a\nfunction to the members of a community undermines their integrity as\nindividuals. [281]  He claims that Aristotle shares his concern and that we can\nget a glimpse of this in his discussion of the Platonic view of the unity of the\ncity. [282]  He suggests that Aristotle’s comments in this passage indicate that\nhe, like Johnson, doubts that communities are truly one thing , i.e.  that he\n is aware that it is problematic to extend the logic of part-whole relations\nbeyond the realm of middle sized substances; [283]   but Aristotle’s objective\nin this passage is in fact to clarify in what sense the city is one .\nAristotle’s main point is that the kind of unity that belongs to the city allows\nfor (in fact presupposes) the heterogeneity of its parts. In other words, by\ncriticizing Plato’s emphasis on homogeneity, Aristotle clarifies his own organic\nview of the part-whole structure of higher level entities; and emphasizes the\nintegrity and diversity of their constitutive elements. While we contend he goes\ntoo far in dismissing the teleological accounts found in the Politics , we\nrecognize that some of Johnson’s concerns are legitimate [284]  and demand a\nmore exhaustive discussion than we can provide here. For now, let it be\nsufficient to note that individuals are considered by Aristotle to be parts of a\ncommunity which exists by nature and has  a specific end which is distinct –\nalthough intimately related – to that of its parts. The upshot is that, while\nman has a certain integrity qua  individual substance, he is not complete in an\nabsolute sense. In short, the part-whole analysis which we find in the Politics\n suggests the same kind of quasi-intrinsic relations which we described in\nconsidering part-whole relations within organisms in our second chapter. Thus\nfor reasons examined in that context, the organic view of the unity of natural\ncommunities defended by Aristotle need not be understood in a way that\nundermines the integrity of its parts. Simply, we should say that being part of\na community and contributing to the actualization of its telos  presupposes\nrather than undermines the integrity of individuals just as the teleological\norganization of the living body presupposes rather than undermines the nature of\nits constitutive elements. To take up the semantic analogy, the first book of\nthe Politics seems to suggest that a sentence (which we compared to a\nsubstance), while it is meaningful and may be understood to some degree when\nread on its own, is not completely self-contained and should ultimately be\nunderstood in the context of a paragraph (family), which in turn exists within a\nchapter (city state).

If human\ncommunities are the result of arbitrary desires, then their teleological\norganization is of no interest to the natural philosopher, [286]  but we have\nshown in our first chapter that man’s goal-directed deliberative  efforts are\nnever arbitrary according to Aristotle (for if they are, they are not genuinely\ngoal-directed); thus the formation of the state, even if it involves a component\nof deliberation, must be understood primarily as the expression of the specific\nnature or form of the community. Thus, we suggest that the kind of part-whole\nanalysis which we find in the Politics   could be applied to non-human nature.\nThis is attested by Aristotle's reliance on the household analogy for\nillustrating the way in which “the nature of the universe contains the good ”\n in   Metaphysics XII 10:\n\nAnd all things are ordered together somehow, but not all alike, —both fishes and\nfowls and plants; and the world is not such that one thing has nothing to do\nwith another, but they are connected. For all are ordered together to one end.\n(But it is as in a house, where the freemen are least at liberty to act as they\nwill, but all things or most things are already ordained for them, while the\nslaves and the beasts do little for the common good, and for the most part live\nat random; for this is the sort of principle that constitutes the nature of\neach.) [287]  I mean, for instance, that all must at least come to be dissolved\ninto their elements, and there are other functions similarly in which all share\nfor the good of the whole. ( Metaph . XII 10, 1075 a10-25) [288]\n\n\n\nThe analogy re-emphasizes Aristotle’s organic view of human communities, [289]\n but most importantly, attests to his view of the organization of the cosmos as\na whole; namely, it makes it clear that it is indeed a whole, [290]  and not\njust a collection of beings. In fact, let us note that the household analogy,\ni.e.  the view that natural substances are more than “roommates” (completely\nself-sufficient entities which happen to share a living space), is the basic\npremise of the science of ecology which is in fact named after the household\nanalogy. [291]\n--------\n\nGiven the new context, refine the summary.\nIf the context isn't useful, return the original summary.\n\nTotal output will be a summary of the article.\n\nSUMMARY:"

The scope of Aristotelian teleology is not limited to the internal functioning of organisms but extends to beings at higher levels of organization. The article proposes an organic global teleological perspective, which unifies the specifically distinct ends of natural substances through their common directedness towards achieving and maintaining the form of the overarching entity they constitute.

    "You are an expert in summarizing classical philosophy articles.\nYour goal is to create a summary of an article.\nWe have provided an existing summary up to a certain point: The article critiques Aristotelian teleology by examining his understanding of explanatory and incidental causes. The author argues that instrumentalization processes contribute to a specific self-actualization process without appealing to unnatural or extrinsic schemes of explanation. The scope of Aristotelian teleology is not limited to the internal functioning of organisms but extends to beings at higher levels of organization. The article proposes an organic global teleological perspective, which unifies the specifically distinct ends of natural substances through their common directedness towards achieving and maintaining the form of life.\n\nAristotle distinguishes between what is more knowable for us and per se in Posterior analytics books I and II, Metaphysics book A, and De Anima III. He emphasizes both the differentiation and continuity of the different objects and ways of knowing them. The engagement with the world through craft provides an opportunity for a first contact and apprehension of natural kinds. Aristotle relies on an example taken from craft for illustrating the essential relation which unites an explanatory cause and its effect in Ph. II 5, 196 b25.\n\nThe article notes that Aristotle appears to be that humans discover rather than invent crafts. The view of Aristotle's teleology defended by Johnson and others rests on the same premise (as well as the resulting divorce of artificial goal-directedness from its ontological basis). However, it is pointed out that the narrow view of teleology is not inclusive of crafts.\n\nThe article also discusses the nature and degrees of identity relations between different components of living things, such as body and soul. The author notes that Aristotle emphasizes the contribution of external factors to natural motion. The article concludes by stating that Aristotle's view appears to be that humans discover rather than invent crafts, and that teleology is a pervasive concept in human life and thought.\n\nBelow you find a portion of the article:\n--------\n[130]   Aristotle. (1984). Politics  (Jowett, Trans.).\n\n[131]  Let us note also that the violent arts which are practiced for the sake\nof  attaining non-substantial ends are unnatural in more than one way.

  "text": "[262]  For a discussion of the difficulties entailed by Aristotle’s silence, see\nLeroi (2014, p. 310-325) and Nussbaum (1978).

  "text": "[268]   Aristotle. (1984). Politics  (Jowett, Trans.).\n\n[269]   In line with this, he insists on the specific differentiation of kinds\n of communities based on their respective formal and final cause ( Pol. I 1,\n1252a10). See also book VII chapter 4; where the city is clearly considered to\nbe an entity with a definite nature or form. See also book V chapter 3 (1302b35)\nwhich compares the growth of cities to organic development.\n\n[270]   “And therefore, if earlier forms of society are natural, so is the\nstate, for it is the end of them and the nature of a thing is its end. For what\neach thing is when fully developed, we call its nature, whether we are speaking\nof a man, a horse, or a family. ” ( Pol.  I 1,  1252 b30 -35).   Aristotle.\n(1984). Politics  (Jowett, Trans.).\n\n\n\n\n\n[271]   Aristotle. (1984). Politics  (Jowett, Trans.).\n\n[272]   Pol . I 2, 1253a35 also suggests that the isolated individual is somehow\ndehumanized: “ If he has not excellence, he is the most unholy and the worst\nsavage of animals, and the most full of lust and gluttony. But justice is the\nbond of men in state; for the administration of justice, which is the\ndetermination of what is just, is the principle of order in political society.”.\n\n[273]  See especially chapters 2-7.\n\n[274]  In Pol . III 4, 1277 a5-7 he explicitly compares the diversity of the\nparts of a city to that of the internal parts of an organism; and again at 1277\nb20-25.\n\n[275]   “So it must necessarily be supposed to be with the excellences of\ncharacter also; all should partake of them, but only in such a manner  and\ndegree as is required by each for the fulfillment of his function.” ( Pol.  I\n13,  1260 a15-20)   Aristotle. (1984). Politics  (Jowett, Trans.). Along the\nsame line see Pol. III 4, 1277a5-12. See also Pol   IV 4, 1290b21-35 for an\nexplicit comparison between the functions of organs and the role of individual\nmembers of a community.\n\n\n\n[276]  Leroi calls the Politics  a work of sociobiology (2014, p. 311), and\nJohnson likewise recognizes that “Aristotle treats political science to some\nextent like a natural science”   (2005, p. 238).\n\n\n\n[277]   In fact, Johnson (2005) covers a lot more ground than we are able to\nhere, the whole section ( 8.5 ) contains precious references (primary and\nsecondary) and constitutes a very helpful starting point for investigating\nAristotle’s views on the teleological organization beyond individual substances.\n\n[278]  Johnson, 2005, p. 238.\n\n[279]   It seems that perhaps Johnson has in mind that granting organic unity to\na whole community entails that it is a living organism.\n\n[280]  Johnson, 2005, p. 246.  \n\n[281]  On p.243 Johnson (2005) includes yet another comparative table which\nopposes strictly intrinsic ends and arbitrary instrumental uses.\n\n\n\n[282]   Pol . II 2. For a helpful discussion of this passage, see Narbonne\n(2020).\n\n[283]  Johnson, 2005, p.245."

  "text": "[282]   Pol . II 2. For a helpful discussion of this passage, see Narbonne\n(2020).\n\n[283]  Johnson, 2005, p.245.\n\n[284]  For instance, he is right to note that presenting individual humans as\nfunctional rather than compositional parts of the family seems to undermine\ntheir status as a substance. (Johnson, 2005, p.241). Wardy expresses the same,\nand other related concerns (1993, p. 25-26).\n\n[285]   In other words, we suggest that in Aristotle's view, we can find being\nin different – but reconcilable – ways at different levels of organization. By\ncontrast, Johnson’s perspective entails a ‘horizontal’ ontology, in the sense\nthat everything exists at the same level of composition, i.e. according to him,\nnatural substances are ‘besides’ one another, so to speak, and may never be in\npart-whole relations, which means that everything above (and below) the level of\nnatural substances is a useful but arbitrary abstraction at best.\n\n\n\n[286]  This is the view implied by Johnson’s reading of the passage from Pol . I\n8 (2005, p. 231).

The author argues that instrumentalization processes contribute to a specific self-actualization process without appealing to unnatural or extrinsic schemes of explanation. The scope of Aristotelian teleology is not limited to the internal functioning of organisms but extends to beings at higher levels of organization, such as communities and ecosystems. The author proposes an organic global teleological perspective, which unifies the specifically distinct ends of natural substances through their common directedness towards achieving and maintaining the form of life. The article notes that Aristotle distinguishes between what is more knowable for us and per se in Posterior analytics books I and II, Metaphysics book A, and De Anima III, emphasizing both the differentiation and continuity of the different objects and ways of knowing them. The distinction between final and efficient causes is a central theme of the article. The author contends that the paradigm of efficient causality i.e., a failure to consider ends as causes in their own right, reveals a commitment to this distinction. This view entails an impoverished conception of teleological causation.\n\nAristotle insists on the specific differentiation of kinds of communities based on their respective formal and final cause (Pol. I 1, 1252a10). He considers cities to be entities with a definite nature or form (Pol. I chapter 4) and compares the growth of cities to organic development (Pol. V chapter 3, 1302b35). Aristotle also emphasizes that justice is the bond of men in state, suggesting that the administration of justice is the principle of order in political society (Pol. I 2, 1253a35-7). He compares the diversity of the parts of a city to that of the internal parts of an organism (Pol. III 4, 1277 a5-7 and b20-25) and suggests that all should partake of excellences of character in such a manner as required by each for the fulfillment of his function (Pol.

Aristotle considers cities to be entities with a definite nature or form and compares the growth of cities to organic development. He emphasizes that justice is the bond of men in state, suggesting that the administration of justice is the principle of order in political society. He compares the diversity of the parts of a city to that of the internal parts of an organism and suggests that all should partake of excellences of character in such a manner as required by each for the fulfillment of his function.

The article also notes that Aristotle treats political science to some extent like a natural science, and emphasizes that everything exists at the same level of composition according to Johnson's perspective, which is referred to as a 'horizontal' ontology. In contrast, the author proposes an organic global teleological perspective, which unifies the specifically distinct ends of natural substances through their common directedness towards achieving and maintaining the form of life.

## 3- Final Summary Only for These Laurence - Aristotle’s Intrinsic Teleology (epub)

The article examines Aristotle's view of teleology and his silence on restricting teleological accounts to middle-sized substances. The author argues that Johnson's interpretation of Aristotle's view is limited and fails to address crucial limitations in Johnson's account. The author highlights the significance of comprehensively understanding Aristotle's perspective on teleology to address contemporary philosophical debates.

The author notes that Aristotle did not write an ecological treatise, but it is surprising that a local teleologist would write the Politics than it is that a global teleologist would fail to produce an ecological treatise. The article cites several passages from Aristotle's works, including the History of Animals, Parts of Animals, Generation of Animals, and Motion of Animals, in relation to the topic of ecological speculation and the rarity of ecological speculation in these treatises.

The author argues that in Aristotle's view, being can be found in different ways at different levels of organization. Johnson's perspective entails a 'horizontal' ontology, where everything exists at the same level of composition, and may never be in part-whole relations. The author suggests that Aristotle's comments about the instrumental role played by plants in animal development can be reconciled with his narrowly intrinsic view by creating a gap between practical and theoretical knowledge.

The author also notes that if the teleological organization of the family was the result of arbitrary intentions, it would be irrelevant to natural science. Seeing as how Aristotle compared living organisms to a well-ordered city, the author argues that the appropriate use of passages dealing with teleology beyond middle-sized substances is to complement an interpretation grounded in passages that deal more directly with the issue of teleology.

The article concludes by highlighting the significance of comprehensively understanding Aristotle's perspective on teleology to address contemporary philosophical debates. The author emphasizes the importance of recognizing the limitations of Johnson's account and providing a more comprehensive understanding of Aristotle's view of teleology.

## 3- Final Summary and Questions for These Laurence - Aristotle’s Intrinsic Teleology (epub)

Based on the provided portion of the article, I can refine the summary as follows:

Summary: The author presents a novel perspective on instrumental relations in Aristotle's philosophy of nature, challenging traditional notions of teleology and causality. The article provides examples from various contexts to illustrate how instrumental relations involve a specific form or structure that makes them particular things with their own intrinsic ends, rather than simply being the result of a chain of causes and effects. This view can be applied to artificial processes beyond just teleology, and has implications for our understanding of Aristotle's concepts of potentiality, mean, and telos in terms of matter.

Example questions and answers:
Q1: How does the author's view of instrumental relations differ from traditional notions of causality in Aristotle's philosophy of nature?

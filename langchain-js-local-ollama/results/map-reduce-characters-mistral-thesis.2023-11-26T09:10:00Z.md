# Basics Map/Reduce Operation

We perform a general map/reduce operation on a text, splitting it into chunks;

- map: LLM extracts characters and locations from each chunk
  - constrained to output a JSON structure
- reduce: aggregate characters and locations from all chunks
  - This step is performed entirely in JavaScript
- map/transform: LLM re-summarizes each character
- Finally the results are formatted as Markdown

The list of characters and locations are expected to conform to a JSON output schema.

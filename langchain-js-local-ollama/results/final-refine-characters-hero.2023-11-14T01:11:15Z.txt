In this extract, we learn more about the Inquisitors and their control by something that is exploiting the weakness the Lord Ruler built into the creatures. Vin discovers a new name, "Mistfallen," which refers to those who fell sick for two weeks rather than a few days. Elend forms a new company of mistfallen soldiers to help reintegrate them into the army. Conrad, a lieutenant from Luthadel, brings news from King Penrod of riots in the city and a request for resupply and troops to restore order.

Below you find a new extract of the story:
--------
43

VIN LANDED WITH A HUSHED rustle of cloth. She crouched in the night, holding up
her dress to keep it from brushing the ashen rooftop, then peered into the
mists.

Elend dropped beside her, then fell into a crouch, asking no questions. She
smiled, noting that his instincts were getting better. He watched the mists too,
though he obviously didn't know what he was looking for.

"He's following us," Vin whispered.

"Yomen's Mistborn?" Elend asked.

Vin nodded.

"Where?" he asked.

"Three houses back," Vin said.

Elend squinted, and she felt one of his Allomantic pulses suddenly increase in
speed. He was flaring tin.

"That lump on the right side?" Elend asked.

"Close enough," Vin said.

"So ..."

"So, he knows I've spotted him," Vin said. "Otherwise, I wouldn't have stopped.
Right now, we're studying one another."

Elend reached to his belt, slipping out an obsidian knife.

"He won't attack," Vin said.

"How do you know?" Elend asked.

"Because," Vin said. "When he intends to kill us, he'll try to do it when you and I
aren't together—or when we're sleeping."

That seemed to make Elend even more nervous. "Is that why you've been staying up
all night lately?"

Vin nodded. Forcing Elend to sleep alone was a small price to pay for keeping
him safe. Is it you back there following us, Yomen? she wondered. On the night
of your own party? That would be quite the feat. It didn't seem likely; but
still, Vin was suspicious. She had a habit of suspecting everyone of being
Mistborn. She still thought it was healthy, even if she had been wrong more
often than not.

"Come on," she said, rising. "Once we get into the party, we shouldn't have to
worry about him."

Elend nodded, and the two continued along their path to the Canton of Resource.

The plan is simple, Elend had said just hours before. I'll confront Yomen, and the
nobility won't be able to help gathering around to gawk. At that point, you
sneak away and see if you can find your way to the storage chamber.

It really was a simple plan—the best ones usually were. If Elend confronted
Yomen, it would keep the attention of the guards on him, hopefully letting Vin
slip out. She'd have to move quickly and quietly, and would probably have to
eliminate some guards—all without raising an alarm. Yet, this appeared to be the
only way in. Not only was Yomen's fortress-like building well lit and extremely
well guarded, but his Mistborn was good. The man had detected her every other
time she'd tried to sneak in—always remaining at a distance, his mere presence
warning her that he could raise the alarm in a heartbeat.

Their best chance was the ball. Yomen's defenses, and his Mistborn, would be
focused on their master, keeping him safe.

They landed in the courtyard, causing carriages to stop and guards to turn in
shock. Vin glanced to Elend in the misty darkness. "Elend," she said quietly, "I
need you to promise me something."

He frowned. "What?"

"Eventually, I'm going to get spotted," Vin said. "I'll sneak as best I can, but
I doubt we'll get through this without creating a disturbance. When it hits, I
want you to get out."

"Vin, I can't do that. I have to—"

"Trust me," Vin said sharply. "Elend, you don't have to help me. You can't help me. I
love you, but you're just not as good at this as I am. I can take care of myself,
but I need to know that I won't have to take care of you, too. If anything goes
wrong—or, if things go right, but the building goes on alert—I want you to get out.
I'll meet you at the camp."

"And if you get into trouble?" Elend asked.

Vin smiled. "Trust me."

Thank you for providing more context! Based on the new information provided, here is an updated list of characters in the story:

Existing Characters (14):

1. Elend Venture
2. Cett
3. Ham
4. Demoux
5. Rashek
6. Yomen (Third Generation)
7. Mailey
8. Marsh
9. Vin

12. Ruin (the voice in Penrod's head, guiding him to commit the assassination)
13. Slowswift

Additional Notes:

* Ruin is a manifestation of Preservation's power, and as such, it is attuned to the power of Preservation. This explains how Ruin was able to escape its prison despite being fabricated of that power.
* The voice in Penrod's head, which is revealed to be Ruin, is a part of Penrod's psyche and has been with him since his early years of life.
* Reen's voice, which is heard whispering in Vin's mind, is a manifestation of Preservation's power as well. It is commonly given advice by the voice, including the warning that anyone will betray Vin.

"ALL RIGHT," BREEZE SAID, "so does somebody want to speculate on how our team's
spy ended up becoming a pseudo-religious vigilante freedom fighter?"

Sazed shook his head. They sat in their cavern lair beneath the Canton of
Inquisition. Breeze, declaring that he was tired of travel rations, had ordered
several of the soldiers to break open some of the cavern's supplies to prepare a
more suitable meal. Sazed might have complained, but the truth was that the
cavern was so well stocked that even a determinedly eating Breeze wouldn't be
able to make a dent in it.

They had waited all day for Spook to return to the lair. Tensions in the city
were high, and most of their contacts had gone to ground, weathering the
Citizen's paranoia regarding a rebellion. Soldiers walked the streets, and a
sizable contingent had set up camp just outside the Ministry building. Sazed was
worried that the Citizen had associated Breeze and Sazed with Spook's appearance
at the executions. It appeared that their days of moving about freely in the
city were at an end.

"Why hasn't he come back?" Allrianne asked. She and Breeze sat at a fine table,
pilfered from an empty nobleman's mansion. They had, of course, changed back to
their fine clothing—a suit on Breeze, a peach dress on Allrianne. They always
changed as soon as possible, as if eager to reaffirm to themselves who they
really were.

Sazed did not dine with them; he didn't have much of an appetite. Captain
Goradel leaned against a bookcase a short distance away, determined to keep a
close eye on his charges. Though the good-natured man wore his usual smile,
Sazed could tell from the orders he'd given to his soldiers that he was worried
about the possibility of an assault. He made very certain that Breeze,
Allrianne, and Sazed stayed within the protective confines of the cavern. Better
to be trapped than dead.

"I'm sure the boy is fine, my dear," Breeze said, finally answering Allrianne's
question. "It's likely he hasn't come back because he fears implicating us in what he
did today."

"Either that," Sazed said, "or he can't get past the soldiers watching outside."

"He snuck into a burning building while we were watching, my dear man," Breeze
said, "I doubt he'd have trouble with a bunch of toughs, especially now that
it's dark out."

Allrianne shook her head. "It would have been better if he'd managed to sneak out of
that building as well, rather than jumping off the roof in front of everyone."

"Perhaps," Breeze said. "But, part of being a vigilante rebel is letting your
enemies know what you are about. The psychological effect produced by leaping
from a burning building carrying a child is quite sound. And, to do that right in
front of the tyrant who tried to execute said child? I wasn't aware that dear little
Spook had such a flair for drama!"

"He's not so little anymore, I think," Sazed noted quietly. "We have a habit of
ignoring Spook too much."

"Habits come from reinforcement, my dear man," Breeze said, wagging a fork at
Sazed. "We paid little attention to the lad because he rarely had an important
role to play. It isn't his fault—he was simply young."

"Vin was young as well," Sazed noted.

"Vin, you must admit, is something of a special case."

Sazed couldn't argue with that.

"Either way," Breeze said, "when we look at the facts, what happened isn't really all
that surprising. Spook has had months to become known to Urteau's underground
population, and he is of the Survivor's own crew. It is logical that they would begin
to look to him to save them, much as Kelsier saved Luthadel."

"We're forgetting one thing, Lord Breeze," Sazed said softly. "He jumped from a
rooftop ledge two stories up and landed on a cobbled street. Men do not survive falls
like that without broken bones."

Breeze shrugged. "Ah, but he is no ordinary man."

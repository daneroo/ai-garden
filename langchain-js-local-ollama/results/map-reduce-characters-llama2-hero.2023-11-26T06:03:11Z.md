# Basics Map/reduce Operation

Here we simply invoke a chain (RunnableSequence)
to extract characters and locations from a text.
It is invoked repeatedly on chunks of the text.

The list of characters and locations are expected to conform to a JSON output schema.

## Parameters

- sourceNickname: hero-of-ages.epub
- modelName: llama2
- chunkSize: 8000

## Level 0 Character Extraction

- Level 0 input summary:
  - 89 docs, length: 1335.42 kB
  - split into 213 chunks, length: 1336.85 kB

Example json output:

```json

He is also the leader of the skaa rebellion, saved by Rashek's oversight, and the emperor of the Final Empire. As a skilled leader and strategist, he is determined to protect his people and uncover the secrets of the Lord Ruler. Despite his noble birth, Elend is an attentive and thorough reader, and his love for Vin drives him to fight against the koloss attack with his Allomancers. With a determined look on his face, he assumes that his learning makes him capable of being a king, but his body aches from fighting, and he has been wounded and crippled by a koloss. Despite these challenges, Elend remains focused on his goal of survival and plays an important role in the story.

In this reformulated description, I have combined and rephrased the original descriptions to provide a clearer picture of Elend's character. I have also added some additional details to highlight his leadership skills, determination, and love for Vin.

It is an enemy of Elend and Vin, guiding Marsh's hand with precision and orchestrating events in the story. As a force of decay, Ruin represents the opposite of creation, promising to destroy life and manipulating individuals for its own malevolent purposes. Despite its god-like mannerisms, it is ultimately a powerful and dangerous foe that must be defeated to save the world from destruction.

### Breeze (30 mentions) - Level 2 Character Summary

Lord Breeze, a skilled Soother and calculating figure, has recently been through a personal tragedy. As a member of Elend Venture's council, he is also part of Kelsier's crew and an expert in manipulating emotions. Despite his charming demeanor, Breeze is known to be grabby and cunning, often hiding his true intentions behind a facade of suaveness. As a Soother, he has the ability to sense when others are wrong, and during the revolution against the Final Empire, he played a key role in keeping the crowd calm through his Soothing abilities. Breeze is also an attentive and thorough reader, with a particular interest in the works of noblemen. However, he is not one to be trusted when it comes to his culinary skills, as he has been known to create questionable dishes after cleaning latrines. Despite this, he remains a member of Elend's inner circle and a skilled warrior, alongside his brother Amira.

### Kelsier (23 mentions) - Level 2 Character Summary

### TenSoon (20 mentions) - Level 2 Character Summary

TenSoon is a kandra with a unique set of characteristics. A former Trust member and Third Generation kandra, he has a long history of eating humans, despite being imprisoned for Contract-breaking. As an insistent and attentive reader, TenSoon is well-versed in the works of others, but his criminal record has made him infamous among his kind. Created from mistwraiths by the Lord Ruler, he possesses a powerful and enigmatic presence that is difficult to ignore. Despite his past mistakes, TenSoon remains a formidable kandra with a deep connection to the world around him. He has been known to jump from podiums in an attempt to escape guards, and has even been referred to as a revolutionary due to his unorthodox methods. Though he struggles with an external force seeking control, TenSoon remains a powerful and intriguing character.

### Quellion (17 mentions) - Level 2 Character Summary

Quellion was a citizen of Urteau, a skaa man who had recently taken to addressing the crowd, urging them to be vigilant in the aftermath of the execution of noblemen. His brother was seen as a threat by Spook, a fact that only added to Quellion's determination and resignation. He was short-haired and rough-skinned, with an unstable gaze that seemed to hint at a troubled mind. Despite this, he held a distinct advantage over Sazed and his team, as he was aware of a cache that they did not know about. This knowledge gave him a certain power, one that he was determined to use to protect himself and those he cared about.

As a local man, Quellion was well-versed in the politics of Luthadel, and had a deep understanding of the machinations of its noblemen. He was aware of a nobleman who feared being pursued by assassins, and had taken it upon himself to protect him. This act of leadership had earned Quellion a measure of respect from the nobleman, who was grateful for his intervention.

Quellion's personality was unstable and difficult to predict, but he was not one to be underestimated. He had a cruel gaze that could freeze even the most hardened of souls, and yet he was willing to consider an alliance with Elend, the leader of the rebellion. Despite his reservations, Quellion was a man who was not afraid to take risks, and had even become a Seeker in order to blackmail Allomancers. His Allomancy powers only added to his already formidable abilities, making him a force to be reckoned with in the world of Luthadel.

### Yomen (16 mentions) - Level 2 Character Summary

Yomen is a complex character with multiple identities and roles. As the head obligator at the Resource building in Fadrex, he holds a position of authority and leadership within the city. Additionally, he was once the leader of the Canton of Resource and the king of the city, demonstrating his political prowess and influence. He is also known as the ruler of the city, the leader of the Faded Army, and even the emperor, highlighting his extensive power and control.

Interestingly, Yomen possesses Mistborn abilities, indicating that he has the ability to manipulate metal and control his surroundings. This adds another layer of complexity to his character, as he is both a high-ranking official in the city and a skilled warrior with supernatural powers.

Yomen's appearance also suggests a man who has been through a great deal of stress and turmoil. He looks haggard and tired, which may be attributed to his recent capture of Vin or his ongoing struggles against Marsh and the koloss. Despite these challenges, Yomen remains a formidable opponent, as evidenced by his reputation as an attentive and thorough reader.

Furthermore, Yomen is a man of faith, believing in a god who ordered nature. This religious conviction may play a significant role in shaping his motivations and actions throughout the story. Overall, Yomen is a multifaceted character with numerous identities and roles, making him an intriguing and formidable opponent in the world of Scadrial.

### Marsh (15 mentions) - Level 2 Character Summary

Marsh, a practical and thorough reader, is an Inquisitor who has undergone a transformation since becoming one. His hooded cloak and burning steel are unmistakable signs of his identity as he moves through Luthadel with purposeful strides. While he once seemed different, Marsh's path has been shaped by the forces of Ruin, leading him to become a formidable weapon against the nobility. His complicated relationship with his master and a troubled past have left their mark on him, making him a leader in the skaa rebellion and Vin's mentor. As an Inquisitor under Ruin's control, Marsh is a loyalist who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. Despite his fall from grace, he remains a force to be reckoned with.

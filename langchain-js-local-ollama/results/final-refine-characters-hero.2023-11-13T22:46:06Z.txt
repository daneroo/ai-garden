Based on the new context provided, I have refined the list of characters as follows:

1. Spook - The main character, a Tineye who has survived a burning building and gained the power of pewter. He is searching for information in the Harrows.
2. Elend Venture - The leader of the skaa population, fighting alongside TenSoon's emotional Allomancy against the koloss army.
3. Vin - A young woman with Allomancy abilities who is fighting against the koloss army alongside Elend and Marsh.
4. Yomen - The ruler of Lekal City, deliberating in the next room with his aides about whether or not to accept the treaty. His decision will have significant consequences for the characters.
5. Sazed - A character involved in the religious aspects of the story and may be relevant to Spook's visions.
6. Breeze - A Soother known for his skill and manipulation, sitting beside Sazed.
7. Allrianne - A young woman who is part of the group accompanying Sazed, Breeze, and Elend. She is described as having blonde hair and is afraid of the empty canal trough.
8. Marsh - A young woman who is fighting against the koloss army alongside Vin and Elend.
9. TenSoon - The main character's enemy, a kandra who has been sentenced to the ritual imprisonment of ChanGaar for rebelling against the First Contract.
10. KanPaar - A kandra who is part of the crowd watching the events unfold in the Trustwarren.

The new context provides more information about Yomen's decision-making process and the political tensions between him and Elend, which may play a significant role in the story. It also highlights the importance of Hemalurgy in the world of Scadrial, which could potentially be relevant to Spook's visions.

Thank you for providing more context to the story! Based on the new information provided, here is a refined list of characters in the story:

1. Marsh - A Keeper who is investigating the city to determine who is controlling the koloss army and trying to find a way to stop them. He has a plan to wait until his master fears Vin and then pull out the spike in his back and kill himself.
2. Vin - A young woman with Allomancy abilities who is fighting against the koloss army alongside Spook and TenSoon. She has a piece of metal that was piercing her body, which allowed the thing they fight to gain control over her.
3. Ruin - The primary antagonist of the story, a powerful being who seeks to bring about the end of the world.
4. Sazed - A Keeper who is investigating the city to determine who is controlling the koloss army and trying to find a way to stop them.
5. TenSoon - A kandra who investigates the city to determine who is controlling the koloss army and provides guidance to Sazed.
6. Spook - An Inquisitor who works alongside Vin, Spook, and TenSoon to fight against the koloss army.
7. Quellion - An obligator who works for Elend and investigates the city to determine who is controlling the koloss army.
8. Beldre - A member of the Second Generation who is revealed to be a traitor and had been working against Spook and his allies.
9. The First Generation - A group of ancient kandra who are the original creators of the Well of Ascension and have knowledge about the Hero of Ages prophecies.

It's worth noting that Quellion's spike was bronze, and he made it from one of the first Allomancers he captured. This information suggests that people with unstable personalities were more susceptible to Ruin's influence, even if they didn't have a spike in them. Zane may have also gotten his spike in a similar manner.

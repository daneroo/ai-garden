# Basics Map/reduce Operation

Here we simply invoke a chain (RunnableSequence)
to summarize a story "by parts".
It is invoked repeatedly on chunks of text.

The summaries themselves are then concatenated.
This is the reduction part.

This summarization is repeated until a sufficiently concise summary is reached.

## Level 2 Character Summaries:

### Aristotle (24 mentions) - Level 2 Character Summary

Aristotle was a renowned ancient Greek philosopher and scientist, known for his extensive works on metaphysics, ethics, politics, and biology. He is widely regarded as the pioneer of systematic investigation into intrinsic teleology, which he believed were inherent purposes found in natural substances. Aristotle's philosophical approach emphasized the distinction between natural and artificial forms, and he was particularly skilled at using craft analogies to illuminate his ideas. He was also an attentive and thorough reader, with a deep understanding of the intermediary properties exhibited by living organisms. In his view, it is precisely because the elements persist through the generation of tissues that these latter exhibit their distinct properties. Aristotle's work has had a profound impact on the development of philosophy and science, and he remains one of the most influential figures in the history of Western thought.

### Johnson (16 mentions) - Level 2 Character Summary

Johnson, a philosopher and historian of philosophy, is a primary interlocutor in the field of Aristotelian studies.

He argues that Aristotle's notion of auxiliary cause is crucial for understanding his view on composition. In addition, Johnson involves readers in familiarizing themselves with Aristotle's biology. His full name is Johnson, and he was active in 2005. As a scholar, Johnson holds views on natural instrumental relations and teleology that align with Aristotle's perspectives.

Byrne is a philosopher and cognitive scientist who approaches problems from multiple angles, using his knowledge of philosophy to inform his scientific research. He is particularly interested in the work of Aristotle and has written extensively on the relationship between philosophy and science. Byrne argues that higher-level organisms are able to understand the nature of material causes because they possess a level of cognitive ability that allows them to presuppose these explanations. As a scholar, he emphasizes the importance of independence and deprives hypothetical necessity of explanatory power, instead focusing on understanding the intricacies of complex systems. Byrne is also an attentive and thorough reader, able to pick up on subtle nuances in his research that others might overlook.

In her book "Aristotle on Substance: The Paradox of Unity," Gill argues that the potentiality of material causes is essential to understanding composition and the nature of substance. While some have expressed concern that elements may be considered to have an extrinsic and incidental relation to the living body if we adopt this view, Gill's work has helped to shed light on the complexities of hylomorphism and the role of material causes in shaping our understanding of substance.

Character Name: Instrumentalization

Instrumentalization is the process of utilizing a tool or method to attain a predetermined objective.

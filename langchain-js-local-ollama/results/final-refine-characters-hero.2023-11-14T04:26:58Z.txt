Based on the new context provided, here is the refined list of characters in the story:

1. Vin
2. Elend
3. King Yomen
4. Ham
5. Reen (Allomancer)
6. Mistborn (as a concept, not a character)

9. Hemalurgy (as a concept, not a character)
10. Inquisitor (who was a Seeker before his transformation)
11. The impostor (kandra)
12. TenSoon
13. Ruin

Explanation:

* Ruin's escape is explained in the context, and it becomes clear that Ruin could not have used the power at the Well of Ascension, as it was attuned to the power of Preservation. Instead, Ruin's prison was fabricated of that power, which acted as a key when the power was released and dispersed. This information does not change the list of existing characters, but rather provides additional context for Ruin's actions.
* The impostor (kandra) is mentioned again in the context, and it is clear that this character is a separate entity from Reen, as they are referred to as "the impostor" rather than "Reen's voice." Therefore, this character remains on the list of existing characters.
* Hemalurgy and Citizen are not mentioned again in the provided context, and therefore remain on the original list of characters.
* The Inquisitor is still referred to as a Seeker before his transformation, but this information does not change the list of existing characters.

Total output: List of 13 characters in the story.

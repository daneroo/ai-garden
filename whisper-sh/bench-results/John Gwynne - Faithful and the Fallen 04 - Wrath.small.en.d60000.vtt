 There it is, fell through the night air, weightless. He caught glimpses of the Tower

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.540
 of Brickhan, Caledas's still smoldering outline at the window, then below, the river coming up

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.940

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.300
 disorientated, realising he didn't know which way was up. All about him was darkness and ice.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.780

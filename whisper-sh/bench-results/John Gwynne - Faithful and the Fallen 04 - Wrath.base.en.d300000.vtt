00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.400
 The year 1144 of the Age of Exiles, Hound Moon.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.000
 There it is fell through the night air, waitless.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.200
 He caught glimpses of the tower of Brickhan.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.960
 Caledus is still smoldering outline at the window, then below, the river coming up to meet him.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.520
 He slammed into the water, the cold shocking the breath out of him.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.520
 He panicked, disorientated, realizing he didn't know which way was up.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.280
 All about him was darkness and ice.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.880
 Then something grabbed his hair, and he was surging upwards, breaking through the water

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.360
 in a burst of spray, and saw Alsion's pale broad phase staring back at him.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.120
 "They will come hunting for us," the giant shouted over the roar of the river, as the

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.120
 current gripped them, sweeping them away from the thunder of warriors' feet crossing the

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.120
 bridge.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.760
 "Let the water take us far from them."

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.700
 Caledus saw the sense of that, though his hands and feet were already numbing from the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.700
 cold.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.800
 He put some effort into swimming, speeding his way from Brickhan, from Caledus, from the

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.160
 Khadashim.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.000
 The thought still jolted him like a blow.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.240
 They turned a bend in the river, and the fortress was gone, darkness enfolding them.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.160
 The soft weak sheen of dawn's gray light filtered down through the lattice of branches above,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.760
 his varidus met Alsion's gaze, an unspoken agreement passing between them, as they both

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.560
 headed for the riverbank.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.960
 It was harder going, swimming across the current, and varidus realized how exhausted his body

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.440
 was, but eventually he felt silt beneath his feet, his hands grasping at reeds as he pulled

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.840
 himself out of the water and flopped onto his back, gasping, his limbs feeling lead-filled.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.680
 Turning, he saw Alsion on the bank, thirty or forty paces upriver from him, staggering

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.480
 wearily towards him before he slumped down beside him with a groan, water dripping from

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.680
 his drooping moustache.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.360
 "Thank you," Alsion said.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.160
 "For what?"

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.800
 "Everything, most of all, for helping my family escape Brickhan's dungeons."

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.320
 His wife and bear.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.240
 How long has he gone without seeing them?

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.080
 And what must he have suffered, knowing they were Caledus and Lycus' prisoners?

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:02.840
 And for destroying Caledus' effigy of me, Alsion continued, "You have set me free."

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.160
 He gave a shudder, followed by a smile, "A shadow is gone from my soul.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.840
 I feel reborn."

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.280
 "If you mean you feel weak as a newborn bear," Veridis muttered as he emptied his boot of

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.020
 water and tried to pull it back on, "then I feel the same."

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.840
 "That is not what I mean," the giant rumbled, regarding Veridis' with serious eyes.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.080
 "You set rainer and tame free, you set me free.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.760
 I owe you a debt beyond all imagining."

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.120
 "You're in no debt to me," Veridis said.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.280
 "I kicked the effigies into the fire on impulse, not really knowing what they were, or what

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.080
 power they held over you."

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.800
 But you suspected, "I," something that Fidele said.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.000
 He thought of Nathair's mother, hoped that she had made it to freedom along with his

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.520
 brother, Kralis, Maken and Albin.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.200
 And your wife and son, I set them free because it was the right thing to do.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.000
 It was not the choice.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.800
 "Ah, but there was true heart, there always is."

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.800
 Veridis shrugged.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.760
 "There is no debt between us.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.440
 You are my friend."

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.880
 One of my only friends, it has turned out.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.640
 His thought swept bitterly to Nathair, and the confession and revelations that had stunned

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.920
 Veridis.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:45.660
 He remembered Calidus' confession, that Nathair had slain Aquilus, his own father.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.040
 Anger and shame twisted through him.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.240
 "There have been so many signs.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.440
 How can I have been deceived for so long?

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.280
 I am a fool."

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.360
 "How long?"

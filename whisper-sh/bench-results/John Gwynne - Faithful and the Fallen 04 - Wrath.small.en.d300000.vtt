00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.340
 ROTH. Book Four of the Faithful and the Fallen by John Gwynn, read by Damian Lynch.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:15.140
 ROTH and Vengeance Pored. John Milton. Paradise Lost.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.380
 Chapter One. There it is.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:27.300
 The year 1144 of the Age of Exiles, Hound Moon.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.580
 There it is, fell through the night air, weightless. He caught glimpses of the Tower

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.540
 of Brickhan, Caledas's still smoldering outline at the window, then below, the river coming up

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.940
 to meet him. He slammed into the water, the cold shocking the breath out of him. He panicked,

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.300
 disorientated, realising he didn't know which way was up. All about him was darkness and ice.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.780
 Then something grabbed his hair, and he was surging upwards, breaking through the water

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.860
 in a burst of spray, and saw Alcion's pale broad face staring back at him.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.460
 "They will come hunting for us," the giant shouted over the roar of the river,

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.220
 as the current gripped them, sweeping them away from the thunder of warriors feet crossing the

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:24.260
 bridge. "Let the water take us far from them." Veridos saw the sense of that, though his hands and

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.100
 feet were already numbing from the cold. He put some effort into swimming, speeding his

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.060
 way from Brickhan, from Caledas, from the Kadashim. The thought still jolted him like a blow.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.460
 They turned a bend in the river, and the fortress was gone, darkness enfolding them.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.420
 The soft, weak sheen of Dorn's grey light filtered down through the lattice of branches above,

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.820
 as Veridos met Alcion's gaze, an unspoken agreement passing between them,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.940
 as they both headed for the riverbank. It was harder going, swimming across the current,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.780
 and Veridos realised how exhausted his body was, but eventually he felt silt beneath his feet,

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.060
 his hands grasping at Reeds as he pulled himself out of the water and flopped onto his back,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:22.100
 gasping, his limbs feeling lead-filled. Turning, he saw Alcion on the bank, thirty of forty paces up

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.860
 river from him, staggering wearily towards him before he slumped down beside him with a grown,

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.980
 water dripping from his drooping moustache. "Thank you," Alcion said. "For what?"

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.420
 "Everything. Most of all for helping my family escape Brickhan's dungeons."

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.660
 His wife and bairn. "How long has he gone without seeing them?"

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.340
 "And what must he have suffered, knowing they were Calidus and Lycus' prisoners?"

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:01.180
 "And for destroying Calidus' effigy of me," Alcion continued. "You have set me free."

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:10.740
 He gave a shudder, followed by a smile. "A shadow is gone from my soul. I feel reborn.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.460
 If you mean you feel weak as a newborn bairn," Veredis muttered as he emptied his boot of water

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.300
 and tried to pull it back on, "then I feel the same."

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:27.100
 "That is not what I mean," the giant rumbled, regarding Veredis with serious eyes.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:37.460
 "You set Reiner and Tain free. You set me free. I owe you a debt beyond all imagining."

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:44.580
 "You're in no debt to me," Veredis said. "I kicked the effigies into the fire on impulse,

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.460
 not really knowing what they were or what power they held over you."

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.060
 "But you suspected?" "Aye."

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.060
 "Something that Fidele said."

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.140
 He thought of Nathair's mother, hoped that she had made it to freedom along with his brother,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:09.540
 Krellus, McKean and Albin. "And your wife and son, I set them free because it was the right thing to

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:21.100
 do. There was no other choice." "Ah, but there was, true heart, there always is," Veredis shrugged.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:29.140
 "There is no debt between us. You are my friend." "One of my only friends," it has turned out.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:35.460
 His thoughts swept bitterly to Nathair and the confession and revelations that had stunned

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:43.500
 Veredis. He remembered Caledus's confession, that Nathair had slain Aquilis, his own father.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:52.860
 Anger and shame twisted through him. There had been so many signs. How can I have been

00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:02.860
 deceived for so long? I am a fool." "How long?" Veredis asked him. "How long have you been Caledus's

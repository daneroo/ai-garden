[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   "This is audible," Harper Collins presents, "The Hobbit," or "There and Back Again" by J.R.R. Tolkien, read by Andy Serkis.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Chapter 1, an unexpected party. In a hole in the ground, there lived a Hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Noi yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat. It was a Hobbit hole. And that means comfort.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   The door opened onto a tube-shaped hole like a tunnel, a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with paneled walls and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats. The Hobbit was fond of visitors.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   The tunnel wound on and on going fairly, but not quite straight into the side of the hill. The hill, as all the people for many miles round called it, and many little round doors opened out of it first on one side and then on another.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   No going upstairs for the Hobbit. Bedrooms, bathroom, cellars, pantries, lots of these. War drobes. He had whole rooms devoted to clothes, kitchens, dining rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   The best rooms were all on the left-hand side going in, for these were the only ones to have windows, deep set, round windows looking over his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   This Hobbit was a very well-to-do Hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of the hill for a time out of mind, and people considered them very respectable. Not only because most of them were rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   You could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure and found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   He may have lost the neighbours' respect, but he gained, well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end. The mother of our particular Hobbit, what is a Hobbit? I suppose Hobbits need some description nowadays since they have become rare and shy of the big people as they call us. They are, or were, a little people about half our height and smaller than the bearded dwarves.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no magic about them except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants that they can hear a mile off.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   They are inclined to be fat in the stomach, they dress in bright colours chiefly green and yellow, wear no shoes because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads, which is curly.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Have longed clever brown fingers, good-natured faces and laugh deep fruity laughs, especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can get it. Now, you know enough to go on with.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   As I was saying, the mother of this Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, that is, was the famous Belladonna Took, one of the three remarkable daughters of the old Took, head of the Hobbits who lived across the water, the small river that ran at the foot of the hill.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   It was often said, in other families, that long ago, one of the Took ancestors must have taken a fairy wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still something not entirely Hobbit-like about them.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And once in a while, members of the Took clan would go and have adventures. They discreetly disappeared and the family hushed it up, but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as respectable as the Baggins' though they were undoubtedly richer.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Not that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after she became Mrs. Bongo Baggins. Bongo, that was Bilbo's father, built the most luxurious Hobbit hole for her, and partly with her money. That was to be found either under the hill or over the hill or across the water, and there they remained to the end of their days.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Still, it is probable that Bilbo, her only son, although he looked and behaved exactly like a second edition of his solid and comfortable father, caught something a bit queer in his make-up from the Took side, something that only waited for a chance to come out.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   The chance never arrived until Bilbo Baggins was grown up, being about 50 years old or so, and living in the beautiful Hobbit hole built by his father, which I've just described for you until he had, in fact, apparently settled down immovable.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was less noise and more green, and the Hobbits were still numerous and prosperous, and Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast smoking, an enormous long wooden pipe that reached down nearly to his woolly toes, neatly brushed. Gandalf came by.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Gandalf. If you had heard only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale. Tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went, in the most extraordinary fashion.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   He had not been down that way under the hill for ages and ages not since his friend the old Took died, in fact, and the Hobbits had almost forgotten what he looked like.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   He had been away over the hill and across the water on businesses of his own since they were all small Hobbit boys and Hobbit girls.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long gray cloak, a silver scarf over which his long white beard hung down below his waist and immense black boots.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   "Good morning," said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining and the grass was very green, but Gandalf looked at him from under long, bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   "What do you mean?" he said. "Do you wish me a good morning or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not or that you feel good this morning or that it is a morning to be good on?"
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   "All of them at once," said Bilbo, and a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors into the bargain. "If you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a fill of mine. There's no hurry we have all the day before us."
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs and blew out a beautiful, gray ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over the hill.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   "Very pretty," said Gandalf, "but I have no time to blow smoke rings this morning. I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, and it's very difficult to find anyone."
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   "I should think so in these parts. We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing, uncomfortable things make you late for dinner. I can't think what anybody sees in them," said I, Mr. Baggins, and stuck one thumb behind his braces and blew out another even bigger smoke ring.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Then he took out his morning letters and began to read, pretending to take no more notice of the old man. He had decided that he was not quite his sort and wanted him to go away. But the old man did not move.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   He stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   "Good morning," he said at last. "We don't want any adventures here, thank you. You might try over the hill or across the water."
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   By this he meant that the conversation was at an end.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   "What a lot of things you do use good morning for," said Gandalf. "Now you mean you want to get rid of me and that it won't be good till I move off?"
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   "Not at all, not at all, my dear sir. Let me see. I don't think I know your name."
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   "Yes, yes, my dear sir, and I do know your name, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. And you do know my name, though you don't remember that I belong to it."
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   "I am Gandalf, and Gandalf means me. To think that I should have lived to be good morning by belred on a tuc sun as if I was selling buttons at the door."
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   "Gandalf? Gandalf? Could gracious me, not the wandering wizard that gave old tucer pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came undone until ordered, not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties about dragons and goblins and giants,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   and the rescue of princesses and the unexpected luck of widow's sons, not the man that used to make such particularly excellent fireworks.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   "Oh, I remember those. Old tuc used to have them on midsummer's eve. Splendid, they used to go up like great lilies and slack dragons and the burnooms of fire and hang in the twilight all evening."
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   "You will notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also that he was very fond of flowers."
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   "Dear me," he went on, "not the Gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the blue for mad adventures, anything from climbing trees to visiting elves or sailing in ships, sailing to other shores. Bless me! Life used to be quite into..."
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   "I mean, you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no idea that you were still in business."
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   "Where else should I be?" said the wizard.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   "All the same, I am pleased to find you remember something about me. You seem to remember my fireworks kindly at any rate, and that is not without hope, indeed. For your old grandfather, tuc's sake, and for the sake of poor belladonna, I will give you what you asked for."
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   "I beg your pardon. I haven't asked for anything." "Yes, you have. Twice now. My pardon. I give it to you. In fact, I will go so far as to send you to this adventure. Very amusing for me, very good for you, and profitable to very likely, if you ever get over it."
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   "Oh, sorry, I don't want any adventures. Thank you, not today. Good morning, but please come to tea any time you like. Why not tomorrow? Come tomorrow! Goodbye!"
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   With that, the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his round green door and shut it as quickly as he dared not to seem rude. Wizards, after all, are wizards."
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   "What on earth did I ask him to tea for?" he said to himself as he went to the pantry. He had only just had breakfast, but he thought a cake or two and a drink of something would do him good after his fright.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Gandalf, in the meantime, was still standing outside the door and laughing long but quietly.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   After a while, he stepped up and, with the spike on his staff, scratched a queer sign on the hobbit's beautiful green front door. Then he strode away just about the time when Bilbo was finishing his second cake and beginning to think that he had escaped adventures very well.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   The next day, he'd almost forgotten about Gandalf. He did not remember things very well unless he put them down on his engagement tablet like this. Gandalf, Tea Wednesday. Yesterday, he had been too flustered to do anything of the kind.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Just before tea time, there came a tremendous ring on the front doorbell and then he remembered. He rushed and put the kettle on and put out another cut and saucer and an extra cake or two and ran to the door.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   "Oh, I'm so sorry to keep you waiting," he was going to say when he saw that it was not Gandalf at all.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt and very bright eyes under his dark green hood. As soon as the door was opened, he pushed inside just as if he had been expected.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   He hung his hoodie cloak on the nearest peg and "Dwellen, a chafs service," he said with a low bow.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   "Up, Bilbo Baggins at yours," said the hobbit, too surprised to ask any questions for the moment.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   When the silence that followed had become uncomfortable, he added, "I'm just about to take tea, a pray come and have some with me, a little stiff perhaps, but he meant it kindly."
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   And what would you do if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation?
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   They had not been at the table long. In fact, they had hardly reached the third cake when they came another, even louder ring at the bell.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   "Excuse me," he said the hobbit, "and off he went to the door. So you have got here at last."
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   That's what he was going to say to Gandalf this time, but it was not Gandalf.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Instead, there was a very old-looking dwarf on the step with a white beard and scarlet hood,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   and he, too, hopped inside as soon as the door was opened just as if he'd been invited.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   "See, they've begun to arrive already," he said when he caught sight of Dwellin's green hood hanging up.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   He hung his red one next to it and "Bolen, a chafs service," he said with his hand on his breast.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   "Thank you," said Bilbo with a gasp.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   It was not the correct thing to say, but they have begun to arrive at flustered him badly.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   He liked visitors, but he liked to know them before they arrived, and he preferred to ask them himself.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   He had a horrible thought that the cakes might run short, and then he, as the host, he knew his duty and stuck to it.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   However painful, he might have to go without.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   "Come along in and have some tea," he managed to say after taking a deep breath.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   "A little beard would suit me better if his all seemed to you, my good sir," said Balen with the white beard.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   "But I don't mind some cake. See cake if you have any."
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   "Lots," Bilbo found himself answering to his surprise, and he found himself scuttling off, too,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   to the cellar to fill a pint beer mug and then to a pantry to fetch two beautiful round sea cakes,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   which he had baked that afternoon for his after supper morsel.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   When he got back, Balen and Dwalen were talking at the table like old friends.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   As a matter of fact, they were brothers.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Bilbo plumped down the beer and the cake in front of them when loud came a ring at the bell again,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   and then another ring.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   And for certain this time he thought as he puffed along the passage, but it was not.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   It was two more dwarves, both with blue hood, silver belts and yellow beards,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   and each of them carried a bag of tools and a spade.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   In they hopped as soon as the door began to open.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Bilbo was hardly surprised at all.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   "What can I do for you, my dwarves?" he said.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   "Killy, at your service," said the one.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   "And Philly," added the other, and they both swept off their blue hoods and bowed.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   "At yours and your families," replied Bilbo, remembering his manners this time.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   "Dwalen and Balen, here already I see," said Killy.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   "Let us join the throng."
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   "Throng!" thought Mr. Baggins.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   I don't like the sound of that.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   I really must sit down for a minute and collect my wits and have a drink.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   He had only just had a sip in the corner while the four dwarves sat round the table,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   and talked about mines, and gold, and troubles with the goblins,
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   and the depredations of dragons, and lots of other things which he did not understand
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   and did not want to, for they sounded much too adventurous, when "Ding dong ling dang"
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   his bell rang again, as if some naughty little hobbit boy was trying to pull the handle off.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   "Someone at the door," he said, blinking.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   "It's some four, I should say, by the sound," said Villy.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   "Besides we saw them coming along behind us in the distance."
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   But poor little hobbit sat down in the hall and put his head in his hands
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   and wondered what had happened, and what was going to happen,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   and whether they would all stay for supper.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Then the bell rang again, louder than ever, and he had to run to the door.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   It was not for, after all, it was five.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Another dwarf had come along while he was wondering in the hall.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   He had hardly turned the knob before they were all inside bowing and saying, "At your service!"
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   One after another, Dory, Norrie, Oren, and Glowyn were their names,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   and very soon two purple hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   were hanging on the pegs, and off they marched with their broad hands,
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   stuck in their gold and silver belts to join the others.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Already it had almost become a throng.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Some called for ale, some for porter, and one for coffee, and all of them for cakes,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   so the hobbit was kept very busy for a while.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   A big jug of coffee had just been set in the hearth.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   The seed cakes were gone, and the dwarves were starting on a round of buttered scones
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   when there came a loud knock.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Not a ring, but a hard rat on the hobbit's beautiful green door.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Somebody was banging with a stick.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Bilbo rushed along the passage, very angry, and altogether bewildered and bewathered.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   This was the most awkward Wednesday he ever remembered.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   He pulled open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in one on top of the other.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   More dwarves, four more, and there was Gandalf behind, leaning on his staff, and laughing.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   He had also, by the way, knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   "Carefully, carefully!" he said.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   "It's not like you, Bilbo, to keep friends waiting on the mat and then open the door like a pop gun.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Let me introduce, before buffer bomber, and especially, Thorin."
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   "At your service!" said Biffer, buffer, and bomber, standing in a row.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   Then they hung up two yellow hoods and a pale green one, and also a sky-blue one with a long silver tassel.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in fact no other than the great Thorin, Okanshield himself,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   who was not at all pleased at falling flat on Bilbo's mat with Biffer, buffer, and bomber on top of him.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   For one thing, bomber was immensely fat and heavy.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   Thorin, indeed, was very haughty and said nothing about service,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   but Paul Mr. Baggins said he was sorry so many times that at last he grunted, "Pray, don't mention it, and stop frowning."
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   "Now we are all here," said Gandalf, looking at the row of thirteen hoods, the best detachable party hoods,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   and his own hat hanging on the pegs.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   "Quite a merry gathering. I hope there is something left for the late comers to eat and drink."
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   "What's that tea?" "Oh, no, thank you. A little red wine, I think, for me."
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   "And for me," said Thorin.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   "And raspberry jam and apple tart," said Biffer.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   "It means pies and cheese," said Biffer.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   "In pork, pie, and salad," said bomber.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   "And more cakes and ale and coffee, if you don't mind."
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Called the other dwarves through the door.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   "Put on a few eggs, there's a good fellow," Gandalf called after him as the hobbit stumped off to the pantries.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   "And just bring out the cold chicken and pickles."
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   "Seems to know as much about the inside of my lard as I do myself," thought Mr. Baggins, who was feeling positively flummoxed,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   and was beginning to wonder whether a most wretched adventure had not come right into his house.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   By the time he had got all the bottles and dishes and knives and forks and glasses and plates and spoons
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   and things piled up on big trays, he was getting very hot and red in the face and annoyed.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   "Confasticate and bother these dwarves," he said aloud. "Why don't they come and lend a hand?"
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Lo and behold, their stood, ballon and dwelling at the door of the kitchen and filly and killy behind them,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   and before he could say knife, they had whisked the trays and a couple of small tables into the parlor
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   and set everything out afresh.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen dwarves all round and Bilbo sat on a stool at the fireside,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   nibbling at a biscuit. His appetite was quite taken away,
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   and trying to look as if this was all perfectly ordinary and not in the least an adventure.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   The dwarves ate and ate and talked and talked and time got on.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   At last they pushed their chairs back and Bilbo made a move to collect the plates and glasses.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   "I suppose you will all stay to supper," he said in his politest, unpressing tones.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   "Of course," said Thorin, "and after we shunt get through the business till late.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   And we must have some music first."
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Now, declare up.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   Thereupon the twelve dwarves, not Thorin, he was too important and stayed talking to Gandalf,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   jumped to their feet and made tall piles of all the things.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Off they went, not waiting for trays, balancing columns of plates, each with a bottle on the top,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   with one hand while the hobbit ran after them almost squeaking with fright.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   "Oh, please be careful, and please don't travel like I can manage."
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   But the dwarves only started to sing.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   Chip the glasses and crack the plates, blood the knives and bend the forks.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   That's what Bilbo Baggins hates.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   Smash the bottles and burn the corks.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Cut the cloths and tread on the fat.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Pour the milk on the pantry floor.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Leave the bones in the bedroom mats.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Splash the wine on every door.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Jump the crocs in a boiling bowl.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   Pound them up with a thumping pole.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   And when you've finished, if any are whole, send them down the hall to roll.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   That's what Bilbo Baggins hates.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   So carefully, carefully with the plates.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   And of course they did none of these dreadful things, and everything was cleaned and put away safe,
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   as quick as lightning while the hobbit was turning round and round in the middle of the kitchen,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   trying to see what they were doing.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Then they went back and found Thorin with his feet on the fender, smoking a pipe.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   He was blowing the most enormous smoke rings, and wherever he told one to go, it went.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Up the chimney, or behind the clock on the mantelpiece, or under the table, or round and round the ceiling,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   but wherever it went, it was not quick enough to escape Gandalf.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Pop.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   He sent a smaller smoke ring from his short clay pipe straight through each one of Thorin's.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Then Gandalf's smoke ring would go green and come back to hover over the wizard's head.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   He had a cloud of them about him already, and in the dim light it made him look strange
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   and sorceress.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Bilbo stood still and watched.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   He loved smoke rings, and then he blushed to think how proud he had been yesterday morning
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   at the smoke rings he had sent up the wind over the hill.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   "Now, for some music," said Thorin.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   "Bring out the instruments."
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Killy and Philly rushed for their bags, and brought back little fiddles.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Dory, Norrie, and Orie brought out flutes from somewhere inside their coats.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   Bomba produced a drum from the hall, Biffer and Boffa went out too and came back with clarinets
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   that they had left among the walking sticks.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Dwellin and Balin said, "Excuse me, I left mine in the porch."
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   "Just bring mine in with you," said Thorin.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   They came back with vials as big as themselves, and with Thorin's harp,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   wrapped in a green cloth.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   It was a beautiful golden harp, and when Thorin struck it, the music began all at once,
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   so sudden and sweet that Bilbo forgot everything else and was swept away into dark lads,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   under strange moons, far over the water, and very far from his hobbit hole under the hill.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   The dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of the hill,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   the firelight flickered.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   It was April, and still they played on while the shadow of Gandalf's beard wagged against the wall.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   The dark filled all the room and the fire died down, and the shadows were lost,
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   and still they played on, and suddenly, first one, and then another, began to sing as they played,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   deep-throated singing of the dwarfs in the deep places of their ancient homes.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   And this is like a fragment of their song, if it can be like their song without their music.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Follow the misty mountains cold, to dungeons deep, and caverns old, we must awake,
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   a break of day, to seek the pale and chance to gold, the dwarfs of yore,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   made mighty spells, while hammers fell like ringing bells, in places deep,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   where dark things sleep, in hollow halls beneath the fells, for ancient king,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   and Elvish Lord, their many a gleaming golden horde, they shaped and wrought, and light they caught,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   to hide in gems, on hilt of sword, on silver necklaces they strung,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   the flowering stars, on crowns they hung, the dragon fire, and twisted wire,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   they meshed the light of moon and sun, far over the misty mountains cold,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   to dungeons deep, and caverns old, we must awake, a break of day,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   to claim a long forgotten gold, goblets they carved, their for themselves,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   and hearts of gold, where no man delves, they lay there long, and many a song,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   were sung and heard by men or elves, the pines were roaring on the height,
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   the winds were moaning in the night, the fire was red, its flaming spread,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   the trees like torches, blazed with light, the bells were ringing in the dale,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   and men looked up, with faces pale, then dragons are, more fierce than fire,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   laid low their towers, and houses frail, the mountain smoked, beneath the moon,
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   the dwarves they heard, the tramp of doom, they fled their hole, to dying fall,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   beneath his feet, beneath the moon, far over the misty mountains grim,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   to dungeons deep, and caverns dim, we must awake, a break of day, to win our hearts,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   and gold from him.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   As they sang, the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   and by cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce and a jealous love,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   the desire of the hearts of dwarves, then something took Ish woke up inside him,
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine trees and the waterfalls,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   and explore the caves and wear a sword instead of a walking stick.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   He looked out of the window, the stars were out in a dark sky above the trees,
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   he thought of the jewels of the dwarves shining in dark caverns, suddenly in the wood,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   beyond the water, a flame leapt up, probably someone lighting a wood fire,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   and he thought of plundering dragons settling on his quiet hill, and kindling it all to flames,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   he shuddered, and very quickly he was playing Mr. Baggins at Bag End under hill again.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   He got up, trembling, he had less than half a mind to fetch the lamp,
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   and more than half a mind to pretend to, and go and hide behind the beer barrels in the cellar,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   and not come out again until all the dwarves had gone away,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   suddenly he found that the music and the singing had stopped, and they were all looking at him,
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   with eyes shining in the dark.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   "Where are you going?" said Thorin, in a tone that seemed to show that he guessed both halves of the hobbits' mind.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   "What about a little light?" said Bilbo apologetically.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   "We like the dark," said all the dwarves, "dark for dark business.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   There are many hours before dawn."
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   "Of course!" said Bilbo, and sat down in a hurry.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   He missed the stool and sat in the fender, knocking over the poker and the shovel with a crash.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   "Hush!" said Gandalf.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   "Let Thorin speak."
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   And this is how Thorin began.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Gandalf, dwarves, and Mr. Baggins, we are met together in the house of our friend,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   and fellow conspirator, this most excellent and audacious hobbit,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   made the hair on his toes never fall out, all praise to his wine and ale.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   He paused for breath, and for a polite remark from the hobbit,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   but the compliments were quite lost on poor Bilbo Baggins, who was wagging his mouth in protest
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   at being called audacious, and worst of all, fellow conspirator.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   Though no noise came out, he was so flummoxed, so Thorin went on.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   "We are met to discuss our plans, our ways, means, policy, and devices.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   We shall soon, before the break of day, start on our long journey.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   A journey from which some of us, or perhaps all of us, except our friend and counselor,
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   the ingenious wizard, Gandalf, may never return.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   It is a solemn moment.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Our object is, I take it, well known to us all.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   To the estimable, Mr. Baggins, and perhaps to one or two of the younger dwarves,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   I think I should be right in naming, Killie and Philly, for instance,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   the exact situation, at the moment, may require a little brief explanation."
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   This was Thorin's style.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   He was an important dwarf.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   If he'd been allowed, he probably would have gone on like this until he was out of breath,
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   without telling anyone there anything that was not known already.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   But he was rudely interrupted.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   Poor Bilbo couldn't bear it any longer.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   At may never return, he began to feel a shriek coming up inside,
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   and very soon it burst out like the whistle of an engine coming out of a tunnel.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   All the dwarves sprang up, knocking over the table.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Gandalf struck a blue light on the end of his magic staff, and in its firework glare,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   the poor hobbit could be seen kneeling on the hearth rug, shaking like a jelly that was melting.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Then he fell flat on the floor and kept calling out, "Struck by lightning,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   over and over again," and that was all they could get out of him for a long time.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   So they took him and laid him out of the way on the drawing sofa with a drink at his elbow,
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   and they went back to their dark business.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   " An excitable little fellow," said Gandalf.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   As they sat down again, "gets funny queer fits, but here's one of the best.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   One of the best, as fierce as a dragon in a pinch."
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   If you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch, you will realise that this was only poetical exaggeration
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   applied to any hobbit, even to old Took's great-grand-uncle, Burora,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   who was so huge for a hobbit that he could ride a horse.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   He charged the ranks of the Goblins of Mount Graham in the Battle of the Greenfields,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   and knocked their king, Goldfimble's head clean off with a wooden club.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   It sailed a hundred yards through the air and went down a rabbit hole,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   and in this way, the battle was won, and the game of Goldf invented at the same moment.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   In the meanwhile, however, Burora's gentler descendant was reviving in the drawing-room.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   After a while and a drink, he crept nervously to the door of the parlour.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   This is what he heard, blowing speaking.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Hmm, or some snort more or less like that. Will he do, do you think?
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   It's all very well for Gandalf to talk about this, hobbit being fierce,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   but one shriek like that in a moment of excitement would be enough to weak the dragon,
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   and all his relatives, and kill a lot of us.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   I think it sounded more like fright than excitement.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   In fact, if it had not been for the sign on the door,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   I should have been sure we'd come to the wrong house.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   As soon as I clapped eyes on the little fellow bobbing and puffing on the mat,
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   I had my doubts. He looks more like a grocer than a burglar.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   Then Mr. Baggins turned the handle and went in. The tuxide had won.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   He suddenly felt he would go without bed and breakfast to be thought fierce.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   As for the little fellow bobbing on the mat, it almost made him really fierce.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Many a time afterwards, the Baggins part regretted what he did now,
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   and he said to himself, "Billbo, you were a fool. You were right in and put your foot in it."
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   "Pardon me," he said, "if I have overheard words that you were saying,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   I don't pretend to understand what you are talking about or to your reference to burglars,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   but I think I'm right in believing, this is what he called being on his dignity,
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   that you think I am no good. I will show you.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   I have no signs on my door. It was painted a week ago,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   and I'm quite sure you have come to the wrong house.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   As soon as I saw your funny faces on the doorstep, I had my doubts.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   But treat it as the right one. Tell me what you want done, and I will try.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   If I have to walk from here to the east of east and fight the wild wereworms in the last desert,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   I had a great-great-great-grand-uncle once, bull-rore-took, and...
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   "Yes, yes, but that was long ago, who?" said Gloane.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   "I was talking about you, and I assure you, there is a mark on this door,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   the usual one in the trade, or it used to be.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   Burglar wants a good job, plenty of excitement and reasonable reward."
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   That's how it's usually read.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   But you can say expert treasure hunter instead of burglar, if you like.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   Some of them do. It's all the same to us.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Gandalf told us there was a man of the sort in these parts looking for a job at once,
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   and that he had arranged for a meeting here this Wednesday time.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   "Of course there is a mark," said Gandalf.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   "I put it there myself, for very good reasons.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   You asked me to find the 14th man for your expedition,
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   and I chose Mr. Baggins.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   Just let anyone say I chose the wrong man or the wrong house,
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   and you can stop at thirteen and have all the bad luck you like,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   or go back to digging coal."
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   He scowled so angrily at Gloane, that the dwarf huddled back in his chair,
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   and when Bilbo tried to open his mouth to ask a question,
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   he turned and frowned at him, and stuck out his bushy eyebrows.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   He'll Bilbo shut his mouth tight with a snap.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   "That's right," said Gandalf. "Let's have no more argument.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   I have chosen Mr. Baggins, and that ought to be enough for all of you.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   If I say he is a burglar, a burglar he is, or will be when the time comes,
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   there is a lot more in him than you guess,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   and a deal more than he has any idea of himself.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   You may, possibly, all live to thank me yet."
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   "No," Bilbo, my boy, fetched the lamp, and let's have a little light on this.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   On the table, in the light of a big lamp with a red shade,
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   he spread a piece of parchment, rather like a map.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   "This was made by Thor, your grandfather, Thorin," he said in answer to the dwarf's excited questions.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   "It is a plan of the mountain.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   I don't see that this will help as much," said Thorin, disappointedly after a glance.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   "I remember the mountain well enough, and the land's about it,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   and I know where Merckwood is, and the withered Heath, where the great dragons bred."
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   "There is a dragon marked in red on the mountain," said Ballet,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   "but it will be easy enough to find him without that, if we ever arrive there."
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   "There is one point you haven't noticed," said the wizard,
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   "and that is the secret entrance. You see that rune on the west side,
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   and the hand pointed to it from the other runes.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   That marks a hidden passage to the lower halls."
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   "It may have been secret once," said Thorin.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   "But how do we know that it is secret any longer?
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   Old Smaug has lived there long enough now to find out anything there is to know about those caves."
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   "He may, but he can't have used it for years and years."
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   "Why?" "Because it is too small."
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   "Five feet high the door, and three may walk abreast," said the runes,
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   "but Smaug could not creep into a hole that size, not even when he was a young dragon,
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   certainly not after devouring so many of the dwarves and men of Dale."
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   "Well, it seems a great big hole to me," squeaked Bilbo,
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   who had no experience of dragons and only of hobbit holes.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   He was getting excited and interested again so that he forgot to keep his mouth shut.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   He loved maps, and in his hall they hung a large one of the country round,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   with all his favourite walks marked on it in red ink.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   "How could such a large door be kept secret from everybody outside,
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   apart from the dragon?" he asked.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   "He was only a little hobbit you must remember."
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   "In lots of ways," said Gandalf,
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   "but in what way this one has been hidden we don't know without going to see?"
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   From what it says on the map,
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   "I should guess there is a closed door which has been made to look exactly
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   like the side of the mountain.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   That is the usual dwarves method I think that is right, isn't it?"
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   "Quite right," said Thorin.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   "Also," went on Gandalf,
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   "I forgot to mention that with the map went a key,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   a small and curious key."
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   "Here it is," he said,
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   and handed to Thorin a key with a long barrel and intricate wards made of silver.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   "Keep it safe."
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   "Indeed I will," said Thorin,
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   and he fastened it upon a fine chain that hung about his neck and under his jacket.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   Now things begin to look more hopeful.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   This news alters them much for the better.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   So far we have had no clear idea what to do.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   We thought to go in east, as quiet and careful as we could as far as the long lake.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   After that, the trouble would begin.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   "Oh, a long time before that if I know anything about the roads east," interrupted Gandalf.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   We might go from there, up along the river running,
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   went on Thorin taking no notice,
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   and so to the ruins of Dale,
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   the old town in the valley there under the shadow of the mountain.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   But we none of us like the idea of the front gate.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   The river runs right out of it through the great cliff at the south of the mountain,
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   and out of it comes the dragon to far too often, unless he's changed his habits.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   "That would be no good," said the wizard.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   "Not without a mighty warrior, even a hero."
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   I tried to find one but warriors of busy fighting one another in distant lands,
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   and in this neighborhood heroes are scarce, or simply not to be found.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   Swords in these parts are mostly blunt, and axes are used for trees and shields,
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   as cradles or dish covers, and dragons are comfortably far off, and therefore legendary.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   That is why I settled on burglary.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   Especially when I remember the existence of a side door,
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   and here is our little Bilbo Baggins, the burglar,
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   the chosen and selected burglar.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   "So now, let's get on and make some plans."
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   "Very well then," said Thorin.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   "Supposing the burglar gives us some ideas or suggestions."
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   He turned with mock politeness to Bilbo.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   "Well, first I should like to know a bit more about things," said he,
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   feeling all confused and a bit shaky inside, but so far still tookishly determined to go on with things.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   I mean, about the gold and the dragon and all that,
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   and how it got there and who it belongs to and so on and further.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   "Bless me," said Thorin.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   "Haven't you got a map, and didn't you hear our song,
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   and haven't we been talking about all this for hours?"
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   "All the same, I should like it, all plain and clear," said he,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   absolutely putting on his business manager, usually reserved for people who tried to borrow money off him,
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   and doing his best to appear wise and prudent and professional and live up to Gandalf's recommendation.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   Also, I should like to know about risks out of pocket expenses,
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   time required and remuneration and so forth, by which he meant,
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   "What am I going to get out of it, and am I going to come back alive?"
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   "Very well," said Thorin.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   Long ago, in my grandfather Thorin's time, our family was driven out of the far north
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   and came back with all their wealth and their tools to this mountain on the map.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   It had been discovered by my far ancestor, Thrain, the old,
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   but now they mined and they tunneled and they made huge halls and great workshops,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   and in addition, I believe they found a good deal of gold and a great many jewels too.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   Anyway, they grew immensely rich and famous and my grandfather was King under the mountain again
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   and treated with great reverence by the mortal men who lived to the south
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   and were gradually spreading up the running river as far as the valley overshadowed by the mountain.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   They built the merry town of Dale there in those days.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   Kings used to send for our smiths and reward even the least skillful most richly.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   Fathers would beg us to take their sons as apprentices and pay us handsomely,
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   especially in food supplies which we never bothered to grow or find for ourselves.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   Altogether, those were good days for us, and the poorest of us had money to spend and to lend
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   and leisure to make beautiful things just for the fun of it,
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   not to speak at the most marvelous and magical toys, the like of which is not to be found in the world nowadays.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   So, my grandfather's halls became full of armor and jewels and carvings and cups,
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   and the toy market of Dale was the wonder of the north.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   Undoubtedly, that was what brought the dragon.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   Dragons steal gold and jewels, you know, from men and elves and dwarves,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   wherever they can find them and they guard their plunder as long as they live,
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   which is practically forever unless they're killed.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   I never enjoy a brass ring of it.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   Indeed, they hardly know a good bit of work from a bad,
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   though they usually have a good notion of the current market value,
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   and they can't make a thing for themselves.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   Not even meant a little loose scale of their armor.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   There were lots of dragons in the north in those days,
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   and gold was probably getting scarce up there with the dwarves flying south or getting killed,
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   and all the general waste and destruction that dragons make going from bad to worse.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   There was a most specially greedy, strong and wicked worm called Smaug.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   One day he flew up into the air and came south.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   The first we heard of it was a noise like a hurricane coming from the north,
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   and the pine trees on the mountain creaking and cracking in the wind.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   Some of the dwarves who happened to be outside, I was one luckily a fine adventurous lad in those days,
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   always wondering about and it saved my life that day.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   Well, from a good way off we saw the dragon settle on our mountain in a spout of flame.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   Then he came down the slopes, and when he reached the woods they all went up in fire.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   By that time all the bells were ringing in Dale and the warriors were arming.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   The dwarves rushed out of their great gate, but there was the dragon waiting for him.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   None escaped that way.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   The river rushed up in steam and a fog fell on Dale, and in the fog the dragon came on them
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   and destroyed most of the warriors, the usual unhappy story.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   It was only too common in those days.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   Then he went back and crept in through the front gate and routed out all the halls and lanes and tunnels,
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   alleys, cellars, mansions and passages.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   After that there were no dwarves left alive inside, and it took all their wealth for himself.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   Probably for that is the dragon's way.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   He has piled it all up in a great heap, far inside and sleeps on it for a bed.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   Later he used to crawl out of the great gate and come by night to Dale and carry away people,
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   specially maidens, to eat until Dale was ruined.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   And all the people dead are gone.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   What goes on there now I don't know for certain, but I don't suppose anyone lives nearer to the mountain
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   than the far edge of the long late nowadays.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding, and cursing smug, and there we were,
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   unexpectedly, joined by my father and grandfather with singed beards.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   They looked very grim, but they said very little.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   When I asked how they got away they told me to hold my tongue and said that one day in the proper time I should know.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   After that we went away and we have had to earn our livings as best we could up and down the lands.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   Often enough, sinking as low as blacksmith work, or even coal mining, but we have never forgotten our stolen treasure.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   And even now, when I will allow, we have a good bit laid by and are not so badly off.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   Here, Thorin stroked the gold chain around his neck.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   We still mean to get it back and to bring our curses home to smog, if we can.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   I've often wondered about my father's and my grandfather's escape.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   I see now they must have had a private side door, which only they knew about, but apparently they made a map.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   And I should like to know how Gandalf got hold of it and why it did not come down to me, the rightful heir.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   "I did not get hold of it. I was given it," said the wizard.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   "Your grandfather, Thor, was killed, you remember, in the minds of Moria, by Azog the goblin."
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   "Truz's name, yes," said Thorin.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   "And three in your father went away on the 21st of April, a hundred years ago, last Thursday, and has never been seen by you since."
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   "True, true," said Thorin.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   "Well, your father gave me this to give you, and if I have chosen my own time and way for handing it over, you can hardly blame me considering the trouble I had to find you.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   Your father could not remember his own name when you came to give me the paper, and he never told me yours, so on the whole I think I ought to be praised and thanked."
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   "Here it is," said he, handing the map to Thorin.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   "I don't understand," said Thorin, and Bilbo felt he would like to say the same.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   The explanation did not seem to explain.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   "Your grandfather," said the wizard slowly and grimy, gave the map to his son for safety, before he went to the minds of Moria.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   "Your father went away to try his luck with the map after your grandfather was killed, and lots of adventures of a most unpleasant sort he had, but he never got near the mountain.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   How he got there, I don't know, but I found him a prisoner in the dungeons of the Necromancer."
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   "Whatever were you doing there?" asked Thorin with a shudder, and all the drawers stood.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   "Never you mind. I was finding things out as usual, and a nasty, dangerous business it was. Even I, Gandalf, only just escaped.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   I tried to save your father, but it was too late. He was whittless and wondering, and had forgotten almost everything except the map and the key.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   "We have long ago paid the Goblins of Moria," said Thorin.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   "We must give a thought to the Necromancer."
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   "Don't be absurd. He is an enemy far beyond the powers of all the dwarves put together, if they could all be collected again from the four corners of the world.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   "The one thing your father wished was for his son to read the map and use the key. The dragon and the mountain are more than big enough tasks for you."
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   "Here, here," said Bilbo, and accidentally said it aloud.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   "Here, what?" they all said, turning suddenly towards him, and he was so flustered that he answered. "Here, what I have got to say."
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   "What's that?" they asked.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   "Well, I should say that you ought to go east and have a look around, and after all there is a side door and dragons must sleep sometimes.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   "I suppose if you sit on the doorstep long enough, I dare say you'll think of something, and, well, don't you know, I think we have talked long enough for one night, if you see what I mean.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   "What about bed and an early start and all that? I'll give you a good breakfast before you go."
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   "Before we go, I suppose you mean," said Thorin.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   "Aren't you the burglar, and isn't sitting on the doorstep your job, not to speak of getting inside the door, but I agree about bed and breakfast.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   "I like six eggs with me, Ham, when starting on a journey, for I'd not poached and mind you, don't break him."
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   After all the others had ordered their breakfast without so much as a please, which annoyed Bilbo very much, they all got up.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   The Hobbit had to find room for all of them and filled all his spare rooms and made beds on chairs and sofas before he got them all stowed and went to his own little bed, very tired, and not altogether happy.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   One thing he did make his mind up about was not to bother to get up very early and cook everybody else's wretched breakfast.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   The tuckishness was wearing off, and he was not now quite so sure that he was going on any journey in the morning.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   As he lay in bed, he could hear Thorin still humming to himself in the best bedroom next to him.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   Thor over a misty mountain skull, two dungeons deep, and caverns old.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   We must stow a break of day to find our long forgotten goal.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   Bilbo went to sleep with that in his ears, and it gave him very uncomfortable dreams.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   It was long after the break of day when he woke up.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   Chapter 2 - Roast Mutton
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   Up jumped Bilbo and putting on his dressing gown went into the dining room.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   There he saw, globally, but all the signs of a large and hurried breakfast.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   There was a fearful mess in the room, and piles of unwashed crocs in the kitchen.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   Nearly every pot and pan he possessed seemed to have been used.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   The washing up was so dismally real that Bilbo was forced to believe the party of the night before had not been part of his bad dreams, as he had rather hoped.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   Indeed, he was really relieved to think that they had all gone without him, and without bothering to wake him up, but never a thank you, he thought.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   And yet, in a way, he could not help feeling just a trifle disappointed.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   The feeling surprised him.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   "Don't be a fool Bilbo Baggins," he said to himself, "thinking of dragons and all that outlandish nonsense at your age."
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   So he put on an apron, lit fires, boiled water, and washed up.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   Then he had a nice little breakfast in the kitchen before turning out the dining room.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   By that time, the sun was shining, and the front door was open, letting in a warm spring breeze.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   Bilbo began to whistle loudly and forget about the night before.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   In fact, he was just sitting down to a nice little second breakfast in the dining room by the open window, when in walked Gandalf.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   "My dear fellow," said he, "whenever are you going to come. What about an early start?"
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   "And here you are, having breakfast or whatever you call it at half past ten."
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   "They left you the message because they could not wait."
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   "Well, what message?" said Paul Mr. Baggins, all in a fluster.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   "Great elephant," said Gandalf. "You are not at all yourself this morning. You have never dusted the mantelpiece."
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   "Well, what's that got to do with it? I've had enough to do with washing up for fourteen.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   If you had dusted the mantelpiece, you would have found this just under the clock," said Gandalf,
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   handing Bilbo a note written, of course, on his own note paper.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   "This is what he read."
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   Thorin, and company to burglar Bilbo greeting.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   For your hospitality are sincerest thanks, and for your offer of professional assistance, our grateful acceptance.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   Terms, cash on delivery, opt to and not exceeding one-fourteenth of total profits, if any.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   All travelling expenses guaranteed in any event, funeral expenses to be defraired by us, or our representatives,
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   if occasion arises and the matter is not otherwise arranged for.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   Thinking it unnecessary to disturb your esteemed repose we have proceeded in advance to make requisite preparations
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   and shall await your respected person at the green dragon in by water at eleven a.m. sharp,
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   trusting that you will be punctual.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   We have the honour to remain. Yours deeply Thorin and Cole.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   "That leaves you just ten minutes. You will have to run," said Gandalf.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   "But," said Bilbo. "No time for it," said the Wizard. "But," said Bilbo again.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   "No time for that either. Off you go."
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   To the end of his days Bilbo could never remember how he found himself outside without a hat,
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   a walking stick or any money, or anything that he usually took when he went out,
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   leaving his second breakfast half finished and quite unwashed up,
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   pushing his keys into Gandalf's hands and running as fast as his furry feet could carry him down the lane,
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   past the great mill, across the water and then on for a mile or more.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   Very puffed he was when he got to buy water just on the stroke of eleven and he found he had come without a pocket handkerchief.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   "Bravo!" said Balin, who was standing at the indoor, looking out for him.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   Just then all the others came round the corner of the road from the village.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   They were on ponies and each pony was slung about with all kinds of baggages, packages, parcels and paraphernalia.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   There was a very small pony, apparently for Bilbo.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   "Up you two get and off we go," said Thorin.
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   "I'm awfully sorry," said Bilbo, "but I have come without my hat and I have left my pocket handkerchief behind and I haven't got any money
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   and I didn't get your note until after ten forty-five to be precise."
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   "Don't be precise," said Balin, "and don't worry, you will have to manage without pocket handkerchiefs
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   and are good many other things before you get to the journey's end.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   As for a hat, I've got a spare hood and a cloak in my luggage."
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   That's how they all came to start jogging off from the inn one fine morning just before May on laden ponies
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   and Bilbo was wearing a dark green hood, a little weather stained, and a dark green cloak borrowed from Dwellin.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   They were too large of him and he looked rather comic.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   What his father, Bongo, would have thought of him, I don't think.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   His only comfort was he couldn't be mistaken for a dwarf as he had no beard.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   They had not been riding very long when up Cane Gandalf very splendid on a white horse.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   He had brought a lot of pocket handkerchiefs and Bilbo's pipe and tobacco so after that the party went along very merrily
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   and they told stories or sang songs as they rode forward all day except of course when they stopped for meals.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   These didn't come quite as often as Bilbo would have liked them but still he began to feel that adventures were not so bad after all.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   At first they had passed through Hobbit lands a wide respectable country inhabited by decent folk with good roads and in or two
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   and now and then a dwarf or a farmer ambling by on business.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   Then they came to lands where people spoke strangely and sang songs Bilbo had never heard before.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   Now they had gone on far into the loan lands where there were no people left, no inns and the roads grew steadily worse.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   Not far ahead were dreary hills rising higher and higher dark with trees.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   On some of them were old castles with an evil look as if they had been built by wicked people.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   Everything seemed gloomy for the weather that day had taken a nasty turn.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   Mostly it had been as good as may can be even in merry tales but now it was cold and wet.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   In the loan lands they had been obliged to camp when they could but at least it had been dry.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   To think it will soon be June grumbled Bilbo as he splashed along behind the others in a very muddy track.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   It was after tea time, it was pouring with rain and had been all day.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   His hood was dripping into his eyes, his cloak was full of water, the pony was tired and stumbled on stones.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   The others were too grumpy to talk.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   And I am sure the rain has got into the dry clothes and into the food bags thought Bilbo.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   Both are burgling and everything to do with it.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   I wish I was at home in my nice hole by the fire with the kettle just beginning to sing.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   It was not the last time he had wished that.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   Still the dwarves jogged on never turning round or taking any notice of the Hobbit.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   Somewhere behind the grey clouds the sun must have gone down for it began to get dark as they went down into a deep valley with a river at the bottom.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   Wind got up and willows along its banks bent and sigh.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   Fortunately the road went over an ancient stone bridge for the river Swarun with the rains came rushing down from the hills and mountains in the north.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   It was nearly night when they had crossed over.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   The wind broke up the grey clouds and a wandering moon appeared above the hills between the flying rags.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   Then they stopped and Thorin muttered something about supper and where should we get a dry patch to sleep on?
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   Not until then did they notice that Gandalf was missing.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   So far he had come all the way with them never saying if he was in the adventure or merely keeping them company for a while.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   He had eaten most, talked most and laughed most but now he was simply not there at all.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   Just when a wizard would have been most useful too.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   Growned Dory and Nori who shared the Hobbits views about regular meals plenty and often.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   They decided in the end they would have to camp where they were.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   They moved to a clump of trees and thought it was drier under them.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   The wind shook the rain off the leaves and the drip drip was most annoying.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   Also the mischief seemed to have got into the fire.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   Dwarves can make a fire almost anywhere out of almost anything.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   Wind or no wind but they could not do it that night.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   Not even Owen and glowing who were specially good at it.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   Then one of the ponies took fright at nothing and bolted.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   He got into the river before they could catch him.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   And before they could get him out again, Philly and Killy were nearly drowned and all the baggage that he carried was washed away off him.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   Of course it was mostly food and there was mighty little left for supper and less for breakfast.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   There they all sat, glum and wet and muttering while Owen and glowing went on trying to light the fire and quarreling about it.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   Bilbo was sadly reflecting that adventures are not all pony rides in May sunshine when Balin who was always their lookout man said,
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   "There's a light over there."
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   There was a hill, some way off with trees on it, pretty thick in parts.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   Out of the dark mass of the trees they could now see a light shining.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   A reddish, comfortable looking light as it might be a fire or torches twinkling.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   When they had looked at it for some while, they fell to arguing.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   Some said, "No."
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   And some said, "Yes."
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   Some said they could go and see and anything was better than little supper, less breakfast and wet clothes all the night.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   Others said, "These parrots are none too well known and at two near the mountains travelers seldom come this way.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   Now the old maps are no use.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   Things have changed for the worse and the road is unguarded.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   They have seldom even heard of the king around here, and that less inquisitive you are as you go along the less trouble you are likely to find."
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   Some said, "After all there are fourteen of us."
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   Others said, "Here is Gandalf got to."
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   This remark was repeated by everybody.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   Then the rain began to pour down worse than ever, and Owen and glowing began to fight.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   That settled it.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   "After all we have got a burglar with us."
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   They said, and so they made off leading their ponies with all due and proper caution in the direction of the light.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   They came to the hill and were soon in the wood.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   Up the hill they went, but there was no proper path to be seen such as might lead to a house or a farm,
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   and do what they could they made a deal of rustling and crackling and creaking and a good deal of grumbling and dratting as they went through the trees in the pitch dark.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   Suddenly the red light shone out very bright through the tree trunks not far ahead.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   "Now it is the burglar's turn," they said, meaning Bilbo.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   "You must go on and find out all about that light and what it is for, and if all is perfectly safe and canny," said Thor into the hobbit.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   "Now scuttle off and come back quick, if all is well, if not come back if you can, if you can't, who twice like a barn owl, once like a screech owl, and we will do what we can."
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:38.000]   Off Bilbo had to go before he could explain that he could not hoot even once like any kind of owl, any more than fly like a bat.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   But at any rate, hobbits can move quietly in woods.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   "Absolutely quietly. They take pride in it, and Bilbo had sniffed more than once at what he called all this dwarfish racket as they went along, though I don't suppose you or I would have noticed anything at all on a windy night, not if the whole cavalcade had passed two feet off."
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:14.000]   As for Bilbo walking criminally towards the red light, I don't suppose even a weasel would have stirred a whisker at it, so naturally he got right up to the fire, for fire it was without disturbing anyone.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   And this is what he saw.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:32.000]   Three very large persons sitting round a very large fire of beach logs, they were toasting mutton on long spits of wood and licking the gravy off their fingers.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   There was a fine toothsome smell, also there was a barrel of good drink at hand, and they were drinking out of jugs.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   But they were trolls. Obviously, trolls. Even Bilbo, in spite of his sheltered life, could see that from the great heavy faces of them and their size and the shape of their legs, not to mention their language, which was not drawing room fashion at all.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   "Mutton yesterday, mutton today, and blime if it don't look like mutton again tomorrow," said one of the trolls. "Never a blinking bit of main flesh we have for long enough," said a second.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   "What the hell William was a thinking of to bring us into these parts of soul beats me, and a drink running short once more?" he said, jogging the elbow of William, who was taking a pull at his jug.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   William choked. "Shut your mouth," he said as soon as he could. "You can't expect folk to stop here forever just to be ate by you and burp.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   You've ate a village and a half between you since we've come down from the mountains. How much more do you want? And time's been up our way when you'd have said thank you, Bil, for a nice bit of fat valley mutton like what this is."
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   He took a big bite off sheep's leg. He was toasting and wiped his lips on his sleeve. Yes, I am afraid trolls do behave like that, even those with only one head each.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   After hearing all this Bilbo ought to have done something at once, either he should have gone back quietly and warned his friends that there were three fair-sized trolls at hand in a nasty mood, quite likely to try toasted dwarf or even pony for a change, or else he should have done a bit of good quick burling.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   A really first-class and legendary burglar would at this point have picked the trolls' pockets. It is nearly always worthwhile if you can manage it.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   Pinch the very mutton off the spits, purlowing the beer and walked off without there noticing him.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   Others, more practical but with less professional pride, would perhaps have stuck a dagger into each of them before they observed it.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   Then the night could have been spent cheerily. Bilbo knew it.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:58.000]   He had read of a good many things he had never seen or done. He was very much alarmed. As well as disgusted, he wished himself a hundred miles away and yet somehow he could not go straight back to Thorin and company empty-handed.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   So he stood and hesitated in the shadows. Of the various burglarious proceedings he had heard of, picking the troll's pockets seemed the least difficult.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:23.000]   So at last, he crept behind a tree, just behind William. Bert and Tom went off to the barrel. William was having another drink, then Bilbo plucked up courage and put his little hand in William's enormous pocket.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   There was a purse in it, as big as a bag to Bilbo. Ha! thought he, warming to his new work as he lifted it carefully out. This is a beginning.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   It was, troll's purses are the mischief and this was no exception.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   "Yeah, oh you!" it squeaked as it left the pocket and William turned round at once and grabbed Bilbo by the neck before he could duck behind the tree.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   "Blimey, Bert! Look what I've copped!" said William. "What is it?" said the others, coming up. "Let me final."
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:11.200]   'Who are you? Bilbo Baggins, a burr, a hobbit,' said poor Bilbo, shaking all over and wondering
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:16.920]   how to make owl noises before they throttled him. 'A burr, a hobbit,' said they, a bit
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:21.760]   startled. Trolls are slow in the uptake and mighty suspicious about anything new to them.
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:27.800]   'What's a burr, a hobbit got to do in my pocket, anyway,' said William. 'And can you
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:33.360]   cook 'em?' said Tom. 'You can try,' said Burnt, picking up a skewer.
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:39.000]   'He wouldn't make 'em bother mouthful,' said William, who had already had a fine supper,
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:44.880]   not when he was skinned and boned. 'Perhaps there's more like him routed out, and we might
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:52.160]   make a pie,' said Burnt. 'Here, you! Are there any more of your sorts sneaking in these
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:57.440]   little woods, ye nasty, dear old rabbit,' said he, looking at the hobbit's furry feet,
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:03.400]   and he picked him up by the toes and shook him. 'Yes, lots,' said Bilbo, before he remembered
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:08.680]   not to give his friends away. 'No, none at all, not one,' he said immediately afterwards.
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:15.560]   'What do you mean,' said Burnt, holding him right way up by the hair this time. 'What
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:20.180]   I say,' said Bilbo, gasping, 'and please don't cook me kind, sirs. I'm a good cook
[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:24.620]   myself, and cook better than I cook, if you can see what I mean. I cook beautifully for
[01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:29.040]   you, a perfectly beautiful breakfast for you, if only you won't have me for supper.'
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:34.960]   'Four little blighter,' said William. He'd already had as much supper as he could hold.
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:42.320]   Also, he had had lots of beer. 'Four little blighter. Let him go.'
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:49.320]   'Not till he says what he means by lots, and none at all,' said Burnt. 'I don't want
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:56.100]   to have me throw cut in my sleep, only toes in the fire till he talks.'
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:14:03.660]   'I won't have it,' said William. 'I call him anyway. You're a fat fool, William,' said
[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:10.620]   Burnt. 'As I've said before this evening, and you're allowed, and I won't take that
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:18.300]   from you, Bill Huggins,' said Burnt, and puts his fist in William's eye. Then there was
[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:20.260]   a gorgeous row.
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:24.420]   Bilbo had just enough wits left when Burnt dropped him on the ground to scramble out of
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:29.700]   the way of their feet, before they were fighting like dogs, and calling one another all sorts
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:35.660]   of perfectly true and applicable mains in very loud voices.
[01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:40.140]   Soon they were locked in one another's arms, and rolling nearly into the fire, kicking and
[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:44.800]   thumping while Tom whacked at them both with a branch to bring them to their senses, and
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:48.480]   that, of course, only made them madder than ever. That would have been the time for Bilbo
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:52.840]   to have left, but his poor little feet had been very squashed in Burnt's big paw, and
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:57.720]   he had no breath in his body, and his head was going round. So there he lay for a while,
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:02.080]   panting, just outside the circle of firelight.
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:07.160]   Right in the middle of the fight up came Balin. The dwarves had heard noises from a distance,
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:11.760]   and after waiting for some time for Bilbo to come back, or to hoot like an owl, they
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:16.280]   started off one by one to creep towards the light as quietly as they could.
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:23.320]   No sooner did Tom see Balin come into the light then he gave an awful howl. Trolls simply
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:29.260]   detest the very sight of dwarves, uncooked. Burnt and Bil stopped fighting immediately,
[01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:34.800]   and "A sack come quick!" they said. Before Balin, who was wondering where in all this
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.840]   commotion Bilbo was, knew what was happening, a sack was over his head, and he was down.
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:46.320]   "There's more to come yet," said Tom. "All I might even took, lots and none at all it
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:53.480]   is," said he. "No burr, hobbits, but lots of these eared dwarves. That's about the
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:59.920]   shape of it. I reckon you're right," said Burnt. "Then we best get out of the light,"
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:05.480]   and so they did. With sacks in their hands that they used for carrying off mutton and
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:11.240]   other plunder, they waited in the shadows. As each dwarf came up and looked at the fire
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:17.280]   and the spilled jugs and the Nord mutton, in surprise, pop, went a nasty smelly sack
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:22.360]   over his head and he was down, soon dwelling lay by Balin, and filly and killy together
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:27.880]   and Dorian, Norian, Ori all in a heap, and Owen and glowing and Biffer and Bumba piled
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:34.120]   uncomfortably near the fire. "Dow teacher," said Tom, "for Biffer and Bumba had given
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:41.120]   a lot of trouble and fought like mad as dwarves will when cornered. Thorian came last, and
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:47.080]   he was not caught unawares. He came expecting Miss Chief and didn't need to see his friend's
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:51.920]   legs sticking out of sacks to tell him that things were not all well. He stood outside
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:58.160]   in the shadows, somewhere off and said, "What's always trouble? Who's been knocking my people
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:04.240]   about?" "It's trolls," said Bilbo from behind a tree. "They had forgotten all about him.
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:10.080]   They're hiding in the bushes with sacks," said he. "Oh, are they?" said Thorian, and
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:14.920]   he jumped forward to the fire before they could leap on him. He caught up a big branch
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:19.840]   all on fire at one end and Bert got that end in his eye before he could step aside. That
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:24.360]   put him out of the battle for a bit. Bilbo did his best. He caught hold of Tom's leg as
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:29.640]   well as he could. It was thick as a young tree trunk, but he was sent spinning up into the
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:35.600]   top of some bushes when Tom kicked the sparks up in Thorian's face. Tom got the branch in
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:40.840]   his teeth for that and lost one of the front ones. It made him howl, I can tell you. But
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:44.800]   just at that moment William came up behind and popped a sack right over Thorian's head
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:51.600]   and down to his toes, and so the fight ended. A nice pickle, they were all in now, all neatly
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:57.780]   tied up in sacks with three angry trolls and two with burns and bashes to remember, sitting
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:18:02.920]   by them arguing whether they should roast them slowly or mince them fine and boil them
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:08.960]   or just sit on them one by one and squash them into jelly and Bilbo up in a bush with
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:15.080]   his clothes and his skin torn, not daring to move for fear they should hear him. It
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:21.120]   was just then that Gandalf came back, but no one saw him. The trolls had just decided
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:26.780]   to roast the dwarves now and eat them later, that was Bert's idea, and after a lot of argument
[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:33.240]   they had all agreed to it. "No good roasting them now, he'll take all night," said a
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:39.520]   voice. Bert thought it was William's. "Don't start a argument all over again, Bil," he
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:45.160]   said. "Or it will take all night." "Who's arguing?" said William. "Who thought it was
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:51.720]   Bert who had spoken?" "You are," said Bert. "You're a liar," said William. So the argument
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:56.720]   began all over again, in the end they decided to mince them fine and boil them, so they
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:03.680]   got a great black pot and they took out their knives. "No good boiling them, we ain't got
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:09.720]   no water and it's a long way down to the well and all," said a voice. Bert and William
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:15.280]   thought it was Tom's. "Shut up," said they, "or we'll never have done, and you can fetch
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:21.320]   the war yourself if you say any more." "Shut up yourself," said Tom, who thought
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:28.120]   it was William's voice. "Oh's arguing, but you I'd like to know." "You're a booby," said
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:33.660]   William. "Booby yourself," said Tom, and so the argument began all over again and went
[01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:38.960]   on hotter than ever until at last they decided to sit on the sacks one by one and squash
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:45.840]   them and boil them next time. "Oh shall we sit on first," said the voice. "Better sit
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:51.840]   on the last for our first," said Bert, whose I had been damaged by Thorin. He thought Tom
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:57.440]   was talking. "Don't talk to yourself," said Tom, "but if you want to sit on the last
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:04.880]   one, sit on him, which is he?" "The one with the yellow stockings," said Bert. "Nonsense,
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:10.360]   the one with the grey stockings," said the voice, like William's. "I made sure it was
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:15.920]   yellow," said Bert. "Yellow, it was," said William. "Then what did you say it was
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:22.640]   grey for?" said Bert. "I never did, Tom said it." "That I never did," said Tom. "It
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:30.520]   was you." "Two to one, so shut your mouth," said Bert. "Who are you talking to?" said
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:37.280]   William. "Now stop it," said Tom and Bert together. "The night's going on and Tom comes
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:43.440]   early." "Let's get on with it!" "Don't take you all and be stone to you," said
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:48.200]   a voice that sounded like William's, but it wasn't. For just at that moment the light
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:53.880]   came over the hill and there was a mighty Twitter in the branches. William never spoke, for he
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:59.480]   stood turned to stone as he stopped and Bert and Tom were stuck like rocks as they looked
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:05.880]   at him. And there they stand to this day, all alone, unless the birds perch on them,
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:11.040]   for trolls, as you probably know, must be underground before dawn, or they go back to
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:15.800]   the stuff of the mountains they are made of and never move again. That is what happened
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:22.520]   to Bert and Tom and William. "Excellent!" said Gandalf as he stepped from
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:28.800]   behind a tree and helped Bilbo to climb down out of a thorn bush. Then Bilbo understood.
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:32.440]   It was the wizard's voice that had kept the trolls bickering and quarreling until the
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:38.440]   light came and made an end of them. The next thing to do was to untie the sacks and let
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:45.200]   out the dwarves. They were nearly suffocated and very annoyed. They had not at all enjoyed
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:50.120]   lying here, listening to the trolls making plans for roasting them and squashing them
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:55.840]   and mincing them. They had to hear Bilbo's account of what had happened to him twice
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:00.640]   over before they were satisfied. "Silly time to go practicing pinching and pocket-picking,"
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:05.960]   said Bombo, "when what we wanted was fire and food." "That's just what you wouldn't
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:11.240]   have got for those fellows without a struggle in any case," said Gandalf. "Anyhow, you
[01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:15.600]   are wasting time now. Don't you realize that the trolls must have a cave or a whole
[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:20.960]   dug somewhere near to hide from the sun in? We must look into it." They searched about
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:26.640]   and soon found the marks of trolls' stony boots going away through the trees. They followed
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:33.920]   the tracks up the hill until, hidden by bushes, they came on a big door of stone leading to
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:40.440]   a cave. But they could not open it. Not though they all pushed while Gandalf tried various
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:45.760]   incantations. "Would this be any good?" asked Bilbo when they were getting tired and
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:50.700]   angry. "I found it on the ground where the trolls had their fight." He held out a large
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:55.240]  ish key, though, no doubt William thought it very small and secret. It must have fallen
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:58.600]   out of his pocket very luckily before he was turned to stone.
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:05.080]   "Why on earth didn't you mention it before?" they cried. Gandalf grabbed it and fitted
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:10.400]   it into the keyhole. Then the stone door swung back with one big push and they all went
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:16.600]   inside. There were bones on the floor and a nasty smell was in the air. But there was
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:21.880]   a good deal of food jumbled carelessly on shelves and on the ground. Among an untidy litter
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:28.320]   of plunder of all sorts from brass buttons to pots full of gold coins standing in a corner,
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:33.040]   there were lots of clothes too hanging on the walls, too small for trolls, I'm afraid
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:38.360]   they belonged to victims. And among them were several swords of various makes, shapes and
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:45.840]   sizes, two caught their eyes particularly because of their beautiful scabbards and jeweled hilts.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:51.680]   Gandalf and Thorin each took one of these and Bilbo took a knife in a leather sheath.
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:56.800]   It would have made only a tiny pocket knife for a troll, but it was as good as a short
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:03.560]   sword for the hobbit. "These look like good blades," said the wizard, half drawing them
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:08.720]   and looking at them curiously. "They were not made by any troll, nor by any smith among
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:13.720]   men in these parts and days. But when we can read the rooms on them we shall know more
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:14.720]   about them."
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:20.240]   "Let's get out of this horrible smell," said Philly, "so they carried out the pots of
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:26.040]   coins and such food was untouched and looked fit to eat. Also one barrel of ale, which
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:31.000]   was still full. By that time they felt like breakfast. And being very hungry they did
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.240]   not turn their noses up at what they had got from the trolls' larder. Their own provisions
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:42.040]   were very scanty. Now they had bread and cheese and plenty of ale and bacon to toast
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:48.320]   in the embers of the fire. After that they slept. For their night had been disturbed
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:53.160]   and they did nothing more till the afternoon. Then they brought up their ponies and carried
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:58.640]   away the pots of gold and buried them very secretly, not far from the track, by the river,
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:04.120]   mounting a great many spells over them, just in case they ever had the chance to come back
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:09.680]   and recover them. When that was done they all mounted once more and jogged along again
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:11.520]   on the path towards the east."
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:18.200]   "Where did you go to, if I may ask?" said Thorin to Gandalf, as they rode along.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:24.320]   "To look ahead," said he. "And what brought you back in the nick of time?"
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:30.260]   "Looking behind," said he. "Exactly," said Thorin.
[01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:37.120]   "But could you be more plain? I went on to spy out our road. It will soon become dangerous
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:43.540]   and difficult. Also I was anxious about replenishing our small stock of provisions. I had not gone
[01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:49.640]   very far, however, when I met a couple of friends of mine from Riven now."
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:56.480]   "Where's that?" "Don't interrupt," said Gandalf. "You will get there in a few days
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:00.920]   now if we're lucky, and find out all about it."
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:07.800]   As I was saying, I met two of Elrond's people. They were hurrying along for fear of the trolls.
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:11.800]   It was they who called me that the three of them had come down from the mountains and
[01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:17.640]   settled in the woods, not far from the road. They had frightened everyone away from the
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:25.840]   dirt, and they way-laid strangers. I immediately had a feeling that I was wanted back. Looking
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:32.760]   behind, I saw a fire in the distance and made for it. So, now you know. Please, be more
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:36.600]   careful next time, or we shall never get anywhere."
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:42.640]   "Thank you," said Thorin.
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:47.040]   After three, a short rest.
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:51.160]   They did not sing or tell stories that day, even though the weather improved, nor the
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:56.760]   next day, nor the day after, they had begun to feel that danger was not far away on either
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:01.520]   side. They camped under the stars, and their horses had more to eat than they had, for
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:05.600]   there was plenty of grass, but there was not much in their bags, even with what they had
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:11.920]   got from the trolls. One morning they folded a river at a wide, shallow place full of the
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:17.380]   noise of stones and foam. The far bank was steep and slippery. When they got to the top
[01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:22.840]   of it, leading their ponies, they saw that the great mountains had marched down very
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:28.120]   near to them. Already they seen only a day's easy journey from the feet of the nearest.
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:34.120]   Dark and drear, it looked. Though there were patches of sunlight on its brown sides, and
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:44.360]   behind its shoulders the tips of snow peaks gleamed. "Is that the mountain?" asked Bilbo
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:49.600]   in a solemn voice, looking at it with round eyes. He had never seen a thing that looked
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:56.920]   so big before. "Of course not!" said Ballet. "That is only the beginning of the Misty
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:02.320]   Mountains, and we have got to get through or over, or under those somehow, before we can
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:08.760]   come into Wilderland beyond. It is a deal of a way, even from the other side of them
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:14.280]   to the lonely mountain in the east, where Smaug lies on our treasure."
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:20.500]   "Ah!" said Bilbo, and just at that moment he felt more tired than he ever remembered
[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:25.720]   feeling before. He was thinking once again of his comfortable chair before the fire in
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:31.600]   his favorite sitting-room in his hobbit hole and of the kettle singing, not for the last
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:39.120]   time. Now Gandalf led the way. "We must not miss the road, or we shall be done for,"
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:45.880]   he said. "We need food for one thing and rest, in reasonable safety. Also it is very necessary
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:51.560]   to tackle the Misty Mountains by the proper path, or else you will get lost in them, and
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:57.320]   have to come back and start at the beginning again, if you ever get back at all."
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:01.840]   They asked him where he was making for, and he answered, "You are come to the very edge
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:06.880]   of the Wild, as some of you may know. Hidden somewhere ahead of us is the Fair Valley
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:14.280]   of Rivernal, where Elrond lives in the last homely house. I sent a message by my friends,
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:20.200]   and we are expected." That sounded nice and comforting, but they had not got there yet,
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:24.760]   and it was not so easy as it sounds to find that last homey house west of the mountains.
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:30.800]   There seemed to be no trees and no valley and no hills to break the ground in front of
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:37.480]   them, only one vast slope going slowly up and up to meet the feet of the nearest mountain,
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:43.760]   a wide land the colour of heather and crumbling rock, with patches and slashes of grass green
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:51.960]   and moss green showing where water might be. Morning passed, afternoon came, but in all
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:58.560]   silent waste there was no sign of any dwelling. They were growing anxious, for they saw now
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:05.040]   that the house might be hidden almost anywhere between them and the mountains. They came on
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:10.520]   unexpected valleys narrow with steep sides that opened suddenly at their feet, and they
[01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:15.880]   looked down, surprised to see trees below them, and running water at the bottom. There were
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:21.880]   gullies that they could almost leap over, but very deep with waterfalls in them. There
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:27.600]   were dark ravines that one could neither jump over nor climb into. There were bogs, some
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:32.320]   of them green, pleasant places to look at, with flowers growing bright and tall, but
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:39.160]   a pony that walked there with a pack on its back would never have come out again.
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:44.240]   It was, indeed, a much wider land from the four to the mountains than ever you would
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:49.840]   have guessed. Bilbo was astonished, the only path was marked with white stones, some of
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:54.880]   which were small, the others were half covered with moss or heather. All together it was
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:31:00.320]   a very slow business following the track, even guided by Gandalf, who seemed to know
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:06.080]   his way about pretty well. His head and beard wagged this way and that as he looked for
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:11.480]   the stones, and they followed his lead, but they seemed no nearer to the end of the search
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:18.520]   when the day began to fail. Tea-time had long gone by, and it seemed suppertime would soon
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:26.000]   do the same. There were moths fluttering about, and the light became very dim, for the moon
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:32.520]   had not risen. Bilbo's pony began to stumble over roots and stones, they came to the edge
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:38.160]   of a steep fall in the ground so suddenly that Gandalf's horse nearly slipped down the slope.
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:44.760]   "Here it is at last," he called, and the others gathered round him and looked over
[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:51.360]   the edge. They saw a valley, far below, they could hear the voice of hurrying water in
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:56.720]   a rocky bed at the bottom, the scent of trees was in the air, and there was a light on the
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:32:02.920]   valley side across the water. Bilbo never forgot the way they slithered and slipped in the
[01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:10.920]   dusk down the steep zig-zag path into the secret valley of Rivendell. The air grew warmer
[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:16.080]   as they got lower, and the smell of the pine trees made him drowsy so that every noun again
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:21.960]   he nodded and nearly fell off or bumped his nose on the pony's neck. Their spirits rose
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:27.920]   as they went down and down, the trees changed a beach and oak, and there was a comfortable
[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:34.680]   feeling in the twilight. The last green had almost faded out of the grass when they came
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:44.120]   at length to an open-glade not far about the banks of the stream. "Mmm, smells like
[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:53.140]   dirt," thought Bilbo, and he looked up at the stars. They were burning bright and blue.
[01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:59.100]   Just then there came a burst of song, like laughter in the trees.
[01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:04.240]   "Oh, what are you doing, and where are you going? Your ponies need chewing, the river
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:10.240]   is flowing. Oh, tra-la-la-la-ly, hear down in the valley. Oh, what are you seeking, and
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:16.400]   what are you making? The faggots are reeking, the bannocks are baking. Oh, tra-la-la-la-ly,
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:24.200]   the valley is jolly, ha-ha. Oh, where are you going with beards all a-wagging? No-no-ing,
[01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:31.600]   no-no-ing, what brings Mr. Baggins and Balen and Wallen down into the valley in June? Ha-ha!
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:38.560]   Oh, will you be staying, or will you be flying? Your ponies are straying, and daylight is
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:46.960]   dying. To fly would be folly to stay would be jolly, and listen and hock till the end
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:57.080]   of the dark to attune. Ha-ha! So they laughed and sang in the trees, and pretty fair nonsense
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:01.960]   I dare say you think, not that they would care. They would only laugh all the more if
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:07.920]   you told them so. They were elves, of course. Soon Bilbo caught glimpses of them as the
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:15.520]   darkness deepened. He loved elves, though he seldom met them, but he was a little frightened
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:21.200]   of them too. Dwarves don't get on well with them, even decent enough dwarves like Thorin
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:25.720]   and his friends think them foolish, which is a very foolish thing to think, or get annoyed
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:32.200]   with them. For some elves tease them and laugh at them, and most of all, at their beards.
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:41.360]   "Well, well," said a voice, "just look Bilbo the Hobbit on a pony. My dear isn't it delicious?"
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:47.080]   Most astonishing, wonderful, that off they went into another song as ridiculous as the
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:54.760]   one I have written down in full. At last one, a tall young fellow came out from the trees
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:35:02.240]   and bowed to Gandalf and to Thorin. "Welcome to the valley," he said. "Thank you," said
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:07.400]   Thorin a bit gruffly, but Gandalf was already office-worse and among the elves talking merrily
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:11.040]   with them. "You are a little out of your way," said the
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:16.920]   elf, "that is if you are making for the only path across the water and to the house beyond.
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:22.160]   We will set you right, but you at best get on foot until you are over the bridge. Are
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:27.480]   you going to stay a bit and sing with us? Or will you go straight on? Supper is preparing
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:32.160]   over there," he said. "I can smell the wood fires for the cooking."
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:38.960]   Tired as he was, Bilbo would have liked to stay a while. Elvish singing is not a thing
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:44.920]   to miss in June, under the stars, not if you care for such things. Also, he would have liked
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:49.720]   to have a few private words with these people that seemed to know his names and all about
[01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:54.900]   him, although he had never seen them before. He thought their opinion of his adventure
[01:35:54.900 --> 01:36:01.560]   might be interesting. Elves know a lot and are wondrous folk for news and know what is
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:07.880]   going on among the peoples of the land as quick as water flows or quicker. But the dwarves
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:13.480]   were all for supper as soon as possible just then and would not stay. On they all went,
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:18.440]   leading their ponies till they were brought to a good path and so at last the very brink
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:24.680]   of the river. It was flowing fast and noisily as mountain streams do of a summer evening
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:30.760]   when sun has been all day on the snow far up above. There was only a narrow bridge of
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:36.880]   stone without a parapet as narrow as a pony could well walk on, and over that they had
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:44.840]   to go slow and careful, one by one, each leading his pony by the bridle. The elves had brought
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:50.360]   bright lanterns to the shore and they sang a merry song as the party went across.
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:56.600]   "Don't dip your beard in the foam, father," they cried to Thorin, who was bent almost onto
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:02.640]   his hands and knees. "It is long enough, without watering it. Mind Bilbo doesn't eat
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:07.240]   all the cakes," they called. "He is too fat to get through keyholes yet."
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:15.800]   "Harsh, harsh good people, and good night," said Gandalf, who came last. "Fellies have ears,
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:21.800]   and some elves have over merry tongues. Good night."
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:28.000]   And so at last they all came to the last homely house and found its doors flung wide.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:33.720]   "Now it is a strange thing, but things that are good to have, and days that are good to
[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:39.920]   spend are soon told without, and not much to listen to, while things that are uncomfortable,
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:47.000]   palpitating and even gruesome, may make a good tale and take a deal of telling anyway."
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:53.560]   They stayed long in that good house, fourteen days at least, and they found it hard to leave.
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:58.200]   Bilbo would gladly have stopped there for ever and ever, even supposing a wish would have
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:03.120]   taken him right back to his hobby a hole without trouble. Yet there is little to tell
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:05.320]   about their stay.
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:10.200]   The master of the house was an elf friend, one of those people whose fathers came into
[01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:14.640]   the strange stories before the beginning of history, the wars of the evil goblins and
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:19.840]   the elves and the first men in the North. In those days of our tale, there were still
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:26.240]   some people who had both elves and heroes of the North for ancestors, and Elrond, the
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:34.600]   master of the house, was their chief. He was as noble and as fair in face as an elf lord,
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:41.520]   as strong as a warrior, as wise as a wizard, as venerable as a king of dwarves, and as
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:44.280]   kind as summer.
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:49.520]   He comes into many tales, but his part in the story of Bilbo's great adventure is only
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:55.560]   a small, though important as you will see if we ever get to the end of it.
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:39:03.120]   His house was perfect, whether you liked food or sleep or work or storytelling or singing
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:11.520]   or just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of them all. Evil things did not come
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:13.360]   into that valley.
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:18.560]   I wish I had time to tell you even a few of the tales, or one or two of the songs that
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:24.200]   they heard in that house. All of them, the ponies as well, grew refreshed and strong
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:29.680]   in a few days there. Their clothes were mended as well as their bruises, their tempers, and
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:35.440]   their hopes. Their bags were filled with food and provisions, light to carry, but strong
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:40.840]   to bring them over the mountain passes. Their plans were improved with the best advice.
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:46.120]   So the time came to Midsomer Eve, and they were to go on again with the early sun on
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:48.080]   Midsomer morning.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:54.360]   Elrond knew all about runes of every kind. That day he looked at the swords they had
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:40:02.320]   brought from the troll's lair, and he said, "These are not troll-make. They are old
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:11.320]   swords, very old swords, of the high elves of the west, my kin. They were made in Gondolin.
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:17.240]   For the goblin wars they must have come from a dragon's horde, or goblin plunder, for dragons
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:26.200]   and the goblins destroy that city many ages ago. This, Thorin, the room's name, or Christ,
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:35.040]   the goblin cleaver in the ancient tongue of Gondolin. It was a famous blade. This Gandalf
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:44.200]   was glam-dring, faux hammer, that the king of Gondolin once wore. Keep them well.
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:49.160]   Since did the trolls get them, I wonder," said Thorin, looking at his sword with new
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:56.280]   interest. "I could not say," said Elrond, "but one may guess that your trolls had plundered
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:01.560]   other plunderers, or come on the remnants of old robberies in some hole in the mountains
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:08.200]   of all. I have heard that there are still forgotten treasures to be found in the deserted
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:16.440]   caverns of the mines of Moria, since the dwarf and goblin war. Thorin pondered these words,
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:22.680]   "I will keep this sword in honour," he said, "may his soon cleave goblins once again."
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:29.000]   "I wish that is likely to be granted soon enough in the mountains," said Elrond.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:36.440]   "But show me now your map." He took it, and gazed long at it, and he shook his head,
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:42.360]   for if he did not altogether approve of dwarves and their love of gold, he hated dragons and
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:47.640]   their cruel wickedness, and he grieved to remember the ruin of the town of Dale,
[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:50.840]   and its merry bells and the burnt banks of the Bright River running.
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:42:00.040]   The moon was shining in a broad silver crescent. He held up the map, and the white light shone
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:06.040]   through it. "What is this?" he said. "There are moon letters here.
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:12.520]   Beside the plain runes which say, five feet high the door and three may walk abreast."
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:19.800]   "What are moon letters?" asked the hobbit full of excitement. He loved maps as I have told you
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:24.680]   before, and he also liked runes and letters and cunning handwriting, though when he wrote
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:30.760]   himself it was a bit thin and spidery. "Moon letters are room letters,
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:35.480]   but you cannot see them," said Elrond, "not when you look straight at them.
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:40.920]   They can only be seen when the moon shines behind them, and what is more.
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:47.160]   With the more cunning sword it must be a moon of the same shape and season as the day when they
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:53.560]   were written. The dwarves invented them and wrote them with silver pens, as your friends could tell you.
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:43:00.360]   These must have been written on a midsummer's eve in a crescent moon a long while ago.
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:07.720]   "What do they say?" asked Gandalf and Thorin together, a bit vexed perhaps that even Elrond
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:12.280]   should have found this out first, though really there had not been a chance before,
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:15.160]   and there would not have been another until goodness knows when.
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:24.120]   "Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks," read Elrond, "and the setting sun
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:30.120]   with the last light of Durin's day will shine upon the keel."
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:37.320]   "Durin. Durin," said Thorin, "he was the father of the fathers of the eldest
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:42.200]   race of dwarves, the longbeards, and my first ancestor. I am his heir."
[01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:45.320]   "Then what is Durin's day?"
[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:52.200]   "The first day of the dwarves' new year," said Thorin, "it is as all should know the first day
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:57.800]   of the last moon of autumn on the threshold of winter. We still call it Durin's day,
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:02.280]   when the last moon of autumn and the sun are in the sky together."
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:07.720]   "But this will not help us much, I fear, for it passes our skill in these days to guess
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:09.320]   when such a time will come again."
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:13.640]   "That remains to be seen," said Gandalf.
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:15.880]   "Is there any more writing?"
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:22.520]   "None to be seen by this moon," said Elrond, and he gave the map back to Thorin.
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:29.480]   And then they went down to the water to see the elves dance and sing upon the midsummer's eve.
[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:37.320]   The next morning was a midsummer's morning as fair and fresh as could be dreamt.
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:44.520]   Blue sky and never a cloud, and the sun dancing on the water. Now they rode away
[01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:50.440]   amid songs of farewell and good speed, with their hearts ready for more adventure,
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:56.040]   and with the knowledge of the road they must follow over the misty mountains to the land beyond.
[01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:07.800]   Chapter 4 Overhill and Underhill There were many paths that led up into those
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:13.640]   mountains and many passes over them, but most of the paths were cheats and deceptions and led
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:21.240]   nowhere or to bad ends, and most of the passes were infested by evil things and dreadful dangers.
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:28.680]   The dwarves and the hobbit, helped by the wise advice of Elrond and the knowledge and memory of
[01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:36.040]   Gandalf, took the right road to the right path. Long days after they had climbed out of the valley
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:44.760]   and left the last homely house miles behind, they were still going up and up and up. It was a hard
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:53.000]   path and a dangerous path, a crooked way and a lonely and a long. Now they could look back
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:59.880]   over the lands they had left, laid out behind them far below, far far away in the west,
[01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:07.240]   where things were blue and faint, Bilbo knew there lay his own country of safe and comfortable
[01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:15.400]   things, and his little hobbit hole, he shivered. It was getting bitter cold up here, and the wind
[01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:21.080]   came shrill among the rocks. Baldur's two at times came galloping down the mountainsides,
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:27.000]   let loose by midday sun upon the snow, and passed among them which was lucky, or over their heads
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:35.640]   which was alarming. The knights were comfortless and chill, and they did not dare to sing or talk
[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:41.880]   too loud, for the echoes were uncanny, and the silence seemed to dislike being broken,
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:47.720]   except by the noise of water on the wail of wind and the crack of stone. The summer is getting on
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:54.120]   down below thought Bilbo, and he making is going on and picnics. They will be harvesting and black
[01:46:54.120 --> 01:47:00.040]   bringing before we even begin to go down the other side at this rate, and the others were thinking
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:05.000]   equally gloomy thoughts, although when they had said goodbye to Elrond in the high hope of a
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:10.520]   midsummer morning, they had spoken gaily of the passage of the mountains, and a riding swift
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:17.080]   across the lands beyond. They had thought of coming to the secret door in the lonely mountain,
[01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:23.800]   perhaps that very next moon of autumn. "And perhaps it will be Durren's day," they had said.
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:27.160]   Only Gandalf had shaken his head and said nothing.
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:34.520]   Dwarves had not passed that way for many years, but Gandalf had, and he knew how evil and danger
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:40.040]   had grown and thriven in the wild, since the dragons had driven men from the lands and the goblins
[01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:46.760]   had spread in secret after the battle of the minds of Moria. Even the good plans of wise wizards like
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:52.920]   Gandalf and of good friends like Elrond go astray sometimes when you are off on dangerous adventures
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:57.560]   over the edge of the wild, and Gandalf was a wise enough wizard to know it.
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:48:04.520]   He knew something unexpected might happen, and he hardly dared to hope that they would pass without
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:10.200]   fearful adventure over those great tall mountains with lonely peaks and valleys where no king
[01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:20.360]   ruled. They did not. All was well, until one day they met a thunderstorm more than a thunderstorm,
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:27.800]   a thunder battle. You know how terrific a really big thunderstorm can be down in the land and in a
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:33.880]   river valley, especially at times when two great thunderstorms meet and clash, more terrible still
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:40.840]   are thunder and lightning in the mountains at night when storms come up from east and west
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:48.600]   and make war. The lightning splinters on the peaks and rocks shiver and great crashes split the air
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:54.680]   and go rolling and tumbling into every cave and hollow, and the darkness is filled with
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:49:02.120]   overwhelming noise and sunlight. Bilbo had never seen or imagined anything of the kind. They were
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:06.760]   high up in a narrow place with a dreadful fall into a dim valley at one side of them.
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:12.440]   There they were sheltering under a hanging rock for the night and he lay beneath a blanket and
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:20.040]   shook from head to toe. When he peeped out in the lightning flashes he saw that across the valley
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:26.680]   the stone giants were out and were hurling rocks at one another for a game and catching them and
[01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:31.720]   tossing them down into the darkness where they smashed among the trees far below or splintered
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:38.520]   into little bits with a bang. Then came a wind and a rain and the wind whipped the rain and
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:43.720]   the hail about in every direction so that an overhanging rock was no protection at all.
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:48.120]   Soon they were getting drenched and their ponies were standing with their heads down and
[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:53.960]   their tails between their legs and some of them were winnying with fright. They could hear the
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:50:02.200]   giants beforeing and shouting all over the mountainsides. "This won't do at all," said Thorin. "If you
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:07.720]   don't get blown off or drowned or struck by lightning, we shall be picked up by some giant
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:13.640]   and kicked sky high for a football." "Well, if you know of anywhere better, take us there!"
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:18.680]   said Gandalf, who was feeling very grumpy and was far from happy about the giants himself.
[01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:25.000]   The end of their argument was that they sent Philly and Kylie to look for a better shelter.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:30.680]   They had very sharp eyes and being the youngest of the dwarves by some 50 years they usually got
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:35.400]   these sort of jobs, when everybody could see that it was absolutely no use sending Bilbo.
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:41.320]   "There is nothing like looking if you want to find something," or so Thorin said to the young
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:46.760]   dwarves. "You certainly usually find something if you look, but it is not always white to the
[01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:50.440]   something you were after, so it proved on this occasion."
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:56.840]   Soon, Philly and Kylie came crawling back, holding onto the rocks in the wind.
[01:50:56.840 --> 01:51:03.320]   "We found a dry cave," they said, "not far around the next corner and ponies and all get inside."
[01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:09.480]   "Have you thoroughly explored it?" said the wizard, who knew that caves up in the mountains
[01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:16.200]   were seldom unoccupied. "Yes, yes!" they said, though everybody knew they could not have been long
[01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:21.560]   about it, they had come back too quick. "It isn't all that big and it does not go far back."
[01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:29.080]   "That, of course, is the dangerous part about caves. You don't know how far they go back,
[01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:35.000]   sometimes, or where a passage behind may lead to, or what is waiting for you, inside."
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:41.800]   But now, Philly and Kylie's news seemed good enough, so they all got up and prepared to move.
[01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:47.240]   The wind was howling and the thunder still growling and they had a business getting themselves
[01:51:47.240 --> 01:51:54.120]   and their ponies along. Still, it was not very far to go, and before long, they came to a big rock
[01:51:54.120 --> 01:52:00.520]   standing out into the path. If you stepped behind, you found a low arch in the side of the mountain.
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:06.200]   There was just room to get the ponies through with a squeeze, when they had been unpacked and
[01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:12.360]   unsettled. As they passed under the arch it was good to hear the wind and the rain outside,
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:16.760]   instead of all about them, and to feel safe from the giants and their rocks,
[01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:25.080]   but the wizard was taking no risks. He lit up his wand. As he did that day in Bilbo's dining room
[01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:32.600]   that seemed so long ago, if you remember, and by its light they explored the cave from end to end.
[01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:37.800]   It seemed quite a fair size, but not too large and mysterious.
[01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:43.000]   It had a dry floor and some comfortable nooks. At one end there was room for the ponies,
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:49.640]   and there they stood, mighty glad of the change, steaming and champing in their nose backs.
[01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:54.600]   Owen and Glowyn wanted to light a fire at the door to dry their clothes, but Gandalf
[01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:59.640]   would not hear of it, so they spread out their wet things on the floor and got dry ones out of
[01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:04.760]   their bundles. Then they made their blankets comfortable, got out their pipes, and blue smoke rings,
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:09.800]   which Gandalf turned into different colours and set dancing up by the roof to amuse them.
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:16.440]   They talked and talked and forgot about the storm, and discussed what each would do with
[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:21.080]   his share of the treasure when they got it which at the moment did not seem so impossible,
[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:28.440]   and so they dropped off to sleep one by one. And that was the last time that they used the
[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:33.720]   ponies, packages, baggages, tools and paraphernalia that they had brought with them.
[01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:39.480]   It turned out a good thing that night that they had brought Little Bilbo with them after all.
[01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:45.560]   For somehow he could not go to sleep for a long while, and when he did sleep he had very nasty
[01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:52.360]   dreams. He dreamt that a crack in the wall at the back of the cave got bigger and bigger and opened
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:57.880]   wider and wider, and he was very afraid but could not call out or do anything but lie and look.
[01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:04.840]   Then he dreamt that the floor of the cave was giving way, and he was slipping, beginning to
[01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:13.000]   fall down, down, goodness knows where to. At that he woke up with a horrible start and found that
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:19.160]   part of his dream was true. A crack had opened at the back of the cave and was already a wide
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:24.600]   passage. He was just in time to see the last of the ponies tail disappearing into it. Of course he
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:30.120]   gave a very loud yell as loud a yell as a hobbit can give, which is surprising for their size.
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:37.560]   Out jumped the goblins, big goblins, great ugly looking goblins, lots of goblins before
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:43.240]   you could say rocks and blocks. There were six to each dwarf at least and two even for Bilbo,
[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:48.280]   and they were all grabbed and carried through the crack before you could say tinder and flint,
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:55.640]   but not Gandalf. Bilbo's yell had done that much good. It had wakened him up wide in a splintered
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:55:00.360]   second and when goblins came to grab him there was a terrific flash like lightning in the cave,
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:07.880]   a smell like gunpowder and several of them felled. The crack closed with a snap and Bilbo and the
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:13.640]   dwarves were on the wrong side of it. Where was Gandalf? Of that neither they nor the goblins had
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:18.600]   any idea and the goblins did not wait to find out. They seized Bilbo and the dwarves and hurried them
[01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:24.760]   along. It was deep, deep, dark, such as only goblins that have taken to living in the heart
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:30.520]   of the mountains can see through. The passages there were crossed and tangled in all directions,
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:37.720]   but the goblins knew their way as well as you do to the nearest post office and the way went down
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:44.200]   and down and it was most horribly stuffy. The goblins were very rough and pinched unmercifully
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:49.960]   and chuckled and laughed in their horrible stony voices and Bilbo was more unhappy even
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:56.200]   than when the troll had picked him up by his toes. He wished again and again for his nice bright
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:56:02.520]   hobbit hole and not for the last time. Now there came a glimmer of red light before them.
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:09.800]   The goblins began to sing or croak keeping time with a flap and their flat feet on the stone and
[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:17.480]   shrieking their prisoners as well. "Clap, snap the black, crack, grip, grab, pinch,
[01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:27.800]   nab and down, down to goblin, down you go, my lad, class, crass, crass, smash, hammer and tongs,
[01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:37.480]   knock around dongs, pound, pound, far underground, ho, ho, my lad, swish, smack, whip, crack,
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:45.320]   batter and beat, yammer and bleat, work, work not dare to shirk while goblins quath and goblins
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:55.080]   laugh round and round far underground below my lad." It sounded truly terrifying. The walls echoed
[01:56:55.080 --> 01:57:04.680]   to the clap, snap and the crush, smash and to the ugly laughter of their ho, ho, my lad. The general
[01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:11.160]   meaning of the song was only too plain, for now the goblins took out whips and whipped them with a
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:17.000]   swish smack and set them running as fast as they could in front of them and more than one of the
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:23.480]   dwarves were already yammering and bleating like anything when they stumbled into a big cavern.
[01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:30.280]   It was lit by a great red fire in the middle and by torches along the walls and it was full
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:37.160]   of goblins. They all laughed and stamped and clapped their hands when the dwarves,
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:41.320]   with poor Bilbo at the back and nearest to the whips, came running in while the goblin
[01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:47.240]   drivers whooped and cracked their whips behind. The ponies were already there, huddled in a corner
[01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:54.040]   and there were all the baggages and packages lying broken, open and being rummaged by goblins
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:58:01.720]   and smelt by goblins and fingered by goblins and quarreled over by goblins. I'm afraid
[01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:08.200]   that was the last they ever saw of those excellent little ponies, including a jolly sturdy little
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:13.800]   white fellow that Elrond had lent to Gandalf since his horse was not suitable for the mountain paths.
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:23.640]   For goblins eat horses and ponies and donkeys and other much more dreadful things and they are
[01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:29.720]   always hungry. Just now however the prisoners were thinking only of themselves. The goblins
[01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:33.960]   chained their hands behind their backs and linked them all together in a line and dragged them
[01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:38.920]   to the far end of the cavern with little Bilbo tugging at the end of the row.
[01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:49.240]   There in the shadows on a large flat stone sat a tremendous goblin with a huge head
[01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:54.920]   and armed goblins were standing round in carrying the axes and the bent swords that they use.
[01:58:54.920 --> 01:59:03.400]   Now goblins are cruel, wicked and bad-hearted. They make no beautiful things but they make many
[01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:09.800]   clever ones. They can tunnel and mine as well as any but the most skilled dwarves when they take
[01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:17.880]   the trouble, though they are usually untidy and dirty. Hammers, axes, swords, daggers, pickaxes,
[01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:23.960]   tongs and also instruments of torture they make very well or get other to make to their design,
[01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:28.440]   prisoners and slaves that have to work till they die for want of air and light.
[01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:35.240]   It is not unlikely that they invented some of the machines that have since troubled the world,
[01:59:35.240 --> 01:59:42.920]   especially the ingenious devices for killing large numbers of people at once, for wheels and
[01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:50.200]   engines and explosions always delighted them and also not working with their own hands more than
[01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:57.560]   they could help. But in those days and those wild parts they had not advanced, as it is called,
[01:59:57.560 --> 02:00:04.760]   so far. They did not hate dwarves especially, no more than they hated everybody and everything

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.340
 ROTH. Book Four of the Faithful and the Fallen by John Gwynn, read by Damian Lynch.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:15.140
 ROTH and Vengeance Pored. John Milton. Paradise Lost.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.380
 Chapter One. There it is.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:27.300
 The year 1144 of the Age of Exiles, Hound Moon.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.580
 There it is, fell through the night air, weightless. He caught glimpses of the Tower

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.540
 of Brickhan, Caledas's still smoldering outline at the window, then below, the river coming up

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.940
 to meet him. He slammed into the water, the cold shocking the breath out of him. He panicked,

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.300
 disorientated, realising he didn't know which way was up. All about him was darkness and ice.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.780
 Then something grabbed his hair, and he was surging upwards, breaking through the water

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.860
 in a burst of spray, and saw Alcion's pale broad face staring back at him.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.460
 "They will come hunting for us," the giant shouted over the roar of the river,

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.220
 as the current gripped them, sweeping them away from the thunder of warriors feet crossing the

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:24.260
 bridge. "Let the water take us far from them." Veridos saw the sense of that, though his hands and

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.100
 feet were already numbing from the cold. He put some effort into swimming, speeding his

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.060
 way from Brickhan, from Caledas, from the Kadashim. The thought still jolted him like a blow.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.460
 They turned a bend in the river, and the fortress was gone, darkness enfolding them.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.420
 The soft, weak sheen of Dorn's grey light filtered down through the lattice of branches above,

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.820
 as Veridos met Alcion's gaze, an unspoken agreement passing between them,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.940
 as they both headed for the riverbank. It was harder going, swimming across the current,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.780
 and Veridos realised how exhausted his body was, but eventually he felt silt beneath his feet,

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.060
 his hands grasping at Reeds as he pulled himself out of the water and flopped onto his back,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:22.100
 gasping, his limbs feeling lead-filled. Turning, he saw Alcion on the bank, thirty of forty paces up

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.860
 river from him, staggering wearily towards him before he slumped down beside him with a grown,

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.980
 water dripping from his drooping moustache. "Thank you," Alcion said. "For what?"

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.420
 "Everything. Most of all for helping my family escape Brickhan's dungeons."

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.660
 His wife and bairn. "How long has he gone without seeing them?"

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.340
 "And what must he have suffered, knowing they were Calidus and Lycus' prisoners?"

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:01.180
 "And for destroying Calidus' effigy of me," Alcion continued. "You have set me free."

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:10.740
 He gave a shudder, followed by a smile. "A shadow is gone from my soul. I feel reborn.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.460
 If you mean you feel weak as a newborn bairn," Veredis muttered as he emptied his boot of water

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.300
 and tried to pull it back on, "then I feel the same."

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:27.100
 "That is not what I mean," the giant rumbled, regarding Veredis with serious eyes.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:37.460
 "You set Reiner and Tain free. You set me free. I owe you a debt beyond all imagining."

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:44.580
 "You're in no debt to me," Veredis said. "I kicked the effigies into the fire on impulse,

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.460
 not really knowing what they were or what power they held over you."

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.060
 "But you suspected?" "Aye."

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.060
 "Something that Fidele said."

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.140
 He thought of Nathair's mother, hoped that she had made it to freedom along with his brother,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:09.540
 Krellus, McKean and Albin. "And your wife and son, I set them free because it was the right thing to

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:21.100
 do. There was no other choice." "Ah, but there was, true heart, there always is," Veredis shrugged.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:29.140
 "There is no debt between us. You are my friend." "One of my only friends," it has turned out.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:35.460
 His thoughts swept bitterly to Nathair and the confession and revelations that had stunned

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:43.500
 Veredis. He remembered Caledus's confession, that Nathair had slain Aquilis, his own father.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:52.860
 Anger and shame twisted through him. There had been so many signs. How can I have been

00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:02.860
 deceived for so long? I am a fool." "How long?" Veredis asked him. "How long have you been Caledus's

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:15.700
 prisoner?" Alcian's smile withered. "Sixteen years." "That is a long time." "It is," Alcian

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:24.100
 clenched his fists, knuckles cracking. "I should have killed him." "To be fair, we both tried hard

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.700
 on that count. I put a knife in his belly, threw him in a fire, and he shattered his chest with a

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:40.620
 war hammer." "Kadashim are hard to kill." "I'd have to agree. Can he be killed?" "Maybe taking his head.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:50.340
 That is how the others are slain." "Others?" "The Jihah, they are demon possessed by Kadashim,

00:05:50.340 --> 00:06:00.140
 at Murias," Alcian said to the question in Veredis's eyes. "The Jihah," Veredis muttered,

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:07.780
 shaking his head, "have been so blind." "You trusted your king and your friend,"

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:18.220
 Alcian shrugged. "There are worse failings to have." "Are there?" "I have dedicated my life to

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:27.540
 a lie." "They both sat in silence, water dripping from clothes and hair." "What now?" Veredis said

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.700
 to himself. "It feels as if my whole life has been dedicated to an affair in his cause."

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:42.300
 "What do I do now?" Alcian regarded him gravely, then poked his chest with a thick finger. "What

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:51.300
 does your heart tell you?" "I will not trust it." "Look what has led me thus far," Veredis said

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:59.860
 sourly. "Your eyes are open now." Veredis sucked in a deep breath, felt exhaustion seeping through

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:11.580
 him. "What would you do?" he asked the giant. "Find my kin, my Reina and Tane." He smiled as he

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:20.540
 said their names. "Kin? My father is slain, as is my brother Ektor. Only Krellus is left."

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:29.700
 Suddenly, he was desperate to see his older brother. "Find our kin," he echoed. "A good place

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:36.760
 to start." Something squawked, a handful of wood pigeons suddenly bursting from the trees and

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:45.380
 flapping noisily overhead. "We should move." "We need cover." "Aye, to the trees," Veredis said as he

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:50.700
 stood suppressing a groan. They were halfway across the clearing when Alcian stopped abruptly,

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:57.980
 staring back along the riverbank. Forms appeared around a distant bend on the track, shadows in

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:03.820
 the half-light that Fawn's canopy created, black shadows with curved swords sheathed across their

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:12.860
 backs. "Kadoshim," Alcian growled. Veredis counted at least seven of them, moving quickly, a loping,

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:18.500
 ground-eating paste like a pack of wolfen. They were spread in a half-circle between the riverbank

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:25.420
 and the tree-line. "They are hunting us, have been running all night long following the river in

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:33.860
 search of our trail." One of the figures paused, the others rippling to a halt about it. It lifted

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:40.540
 its head as if tasting the air, then gave an ululating howl and leapt forwards a new energy

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:50.580
 in its stride. "They've caught our scent." Veredis felt a jolt of fear. He'd faced giants, dregs,

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:55.820
 warbands. But somehow, knowing that the demons of the other world were hunting him, sent a cold

00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:06.620
 shock of fear tingling through his veins. "Kadoshim," Calidis's kin, "my enemy." Calidis

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:11.980
 filled his mind, an image of the man he had thought counsellor and ally emerging from the fire in

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:19.940
 Brican's tower, flame-reathed and snarling. "He has corrupted Nathair and has deceived me for so long.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:28.620
 He is the author of this evil." Fear morphed into a cold rage and he reached for his sword, lips

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:37.460
 twisting. "Move!" Altian grunted and broke into a run. Veredis resisted for a moment, inexplicably

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.740
 wanting to stand and fight these creatures, but Altian dragged him along and, in a heartbeat

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:48.940
 they were only a few strides from the tree-line. He realised the giant had no weapon, no war hammer

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:54.780
 or battle axe strapped across his back, no sword or dagger at his hip. They crashed through the

00:09:54.780 --> 00:10:00.060
 first layer of undergrowth and were immediately enveloped by a twilight world of shadow and thorn.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:08.420
 Altian forged ahead, grunting as branches snapped upon his rock-like torso, thorns whipping at

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:15.220
 Veredis, vines tangling about his boots. For what seemed a long time, Veredis only heard

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:20.820
 his own heart thumping, the rasp of his breath, the thud of Altian's feet. Then there were sounds

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:26.420
 behind him, faint at first, like the rustle of wind through foliage, but soon louder,

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:33.460
 keening cries were floating about him. They splashed through a stream, something sinuous

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:40.340
 and slithered beneath Veredis' feet, making him stumble. "They are almost upon us," he gasped to

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:47.780
 Altian. "Better to turn and fight, hold a sword in my fist than die running." "I know," the giant said,

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:54.740
 turning, chest heaving. Veredis drew his sword as they put their backs to a huge tree, the stream

00:10:54.740 --> 00:11:01.740
 before them, and waited. Forms flitted through the gloom, emerging from a curtain of shadows and thick

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:09.100
 foliage. One was a long way ahead of the others, clothed in the dark mail of the Jihar, pale-skinned,

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:16.740
 dark veins making a tapestry of its flesh. It saw them and leapt the stream, arms reaching for

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:24.260
 Veredis, not even bothering to draw its sword. "Remember, you must take their heads," Altian

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:29.220
 grunted, as he pushed away from the tree, hurling himself into the oncoming kaddashim with bone

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:37.020
 crushing power. The two fell to the ground. Veredis hurtled forwards, sword raised, hacking two-handed

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:42.740
 at the kaddashim's arm, its hand spinning away, blood like oil pumping languidly from the stump.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:49.180
 Then the two forms were rolling together again. Altian growled in pain, then he was on his knees,

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:55.540
 arms wrapped about the kaddashim's torso, pinning its arms at its side. The creature's head writhed,

00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:00.880
 veins bulging as it strained to break free, Altian's face turning purple with the effort,

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:09.020
 his locked fingers slowly pulling apart. "What are you waiting for?" the giant rasped,

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:15.540
 and Veredis swung his sword, chopping into the creature's neck. Dark blood spurted from the

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:20.860
 half-severed neck, the kaddashim screeching with fury, Altian roared with the strain of holding

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:28.140
 the creature. Veredis wrenched his sword free and swung again. The kaddashim's head flew through

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:35.500
 the air landing with a splash in the stream. Its body slumped, legs drumming as Altian fell away

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:43.460
 and rolled clear. A black, icor-like mist flowed from the kaddashim's neck, hissing and swirling,

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:49.220
 gathering above its body, forming a human shape with tattered wings of smoke spread about it,

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:57.980
 and red eyes glowing like coals at its heart. Veredis stared, frozen. It screamed savagely,

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:05.060
 then it was melting away, torn and dispersed by a slight breeze. "What the hell?" Veredis gasped.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:11.900
 "Down!" Altian yelled as he surged up from the ground, a fist slamming into the jaw of a leaping

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:19.100
 kaddashim, hurling it spinning into the undergrowth. Almost as soon as it hit the ground, it was back

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:26.140
 on its feet, twisting like a feral cat. Veredis hefted his sword, spread his legs to meet the

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:30.980
 impact and then something crunched into his side, sending him flying through the air another

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:36.420
 kaddashim's arms locked around his waist. He caught a glimpse of Altian standing,

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:43.740
 kaddashim swarming upon him, then Veredis was slamming into the ground. Pain exploded in his

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:50.220
 shoulder and his sword skidded away. He rolled, punched at his attacker, for a moment staring

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.700
 into its black soulless eyes. Then they were sliding into the stream, the kaddashim beneath

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:59.980
 him, his hands fastening about its neck, squeezing, seeking to crush the life from the black-eyed

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:06.540
 abomination. It bucked and kicked like a wild stallion, thrashing a tempest amidst the stream

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:13.300
 water, but Veredis would not let go. He felt its strength ebbing, some of its vitality fading,

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:18.420
 then hands gripped him from behind, dragging him backwards, his fingers slipping as he was

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:25.020
 hauled to the bank. Another kaddashim stood over him, drawing its sword from its back as

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:30.700
 the one from the stream splashed into view. He rolled and saw a handful of kaddashim circling

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:36.580
 Altian, who had fallen to one knee, the giant bleeding from a dozen wounds. Veredis tried

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:41.460
 to drag himself through the mud towards his friend. Another kaddashim was held in Altian's

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:47.500
 arms. He had one hand gripping its jaw, the other wrapped about its chest. With a savage

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:53.700
 wrench, Altian heaved. Veredis heard the kaddashim's neck break, then the sound of flesh tearing,

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:59.260
 Altian screaming his defiance as he ripped the kaddashim's head from its shoulders. He

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:05.380
 flung the corpse to the ground as the black mist boiled from the dead creature's wound.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:11.980
 A searing pain lanced through Veredis's leg, a kaddashim blade scoring along his thigh.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:16.260
 He dropped to the ground, looked back at the two kaddashim on the stream bank. They were

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:23.100
 following him, toying with him. The one with the drawn sword slashed his blade across Veredis's

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:30.740
 upheld forearm, a new cut burning like fire. "Think we'll bleed you a while," the kaddashim

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:38.540
 said, leering with pale lips, "pay you back for the chase you've led us." It should not

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:44.820
 end like this. Frustration gave Veredis a last surge of strength and he rolled to his

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:51.700
 feet, pushed himself upright. The kaddashim before him grinned, then paused, cocking its

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:58.860
 head to one side. Figures burst out of the gloom. Veredis's hopes rose and then fell

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:04.860
 as he saw the newcomers were dressed in black breastplates with silver eagles on their chests.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:10.060
 Eagle guard, no doubt sent by Nefear to make sure that his monsters complete their task.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:16.980
 Ten, twelve, fifteen more men, one of them tall and wide.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:25.860
 Veredis blinked, something familiar. "Well met, little brother," the big man bellowed,

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:34.740
 whining wildly. A moment's confusion followed swiftly by elation. "Krellus!"

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.680
 Then Krellus and his men were attacking the kaddashim, Krellus taking her head in one

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:45.220
 great swing of his longsword. Another warrior swept into view, this one not dressed as a

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:51.900
 man of tenerbrow but gripping a knife in each hand. He joined Krellus and together they attacked

00:16:51.900 --> 00:17:00.980
 the kaddashim before Veredis, McKean and Krellus.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:06.140
 Chapter 2 Nefear

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:12.180
 Nefear stood in the great hall of Drassil and stared at the giant skeleton on its throne.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:18.740
 The bones of the ribcage surrounded a thick-shafted spear, the wood dark and pale-veined, only

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:25.780
 a hint of black iron of the blade visible, the rest buried in the great tree of Drassil.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:34.180
 So that is Scald, High King of the Giants, and that is the Starstone Spear. Scald, the

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:40.800
 last man to rule a united empire where giants and men lived together in peace.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:45.980
 Will I be the next to unite this shattered world? The skeleton was mottled yellow and

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:52.460
 brown, ancient, the brow of the skull broad and thick eye sockets, black holes that seemed

00:17:52.460 --> 00:18:03.340
 to stare at Nefear, questioning him. Are you worthy? Are you capable? He sighed. History

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:11.240
 shall be my judge, nothing and no one else. The hand touched his shoulder.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:17.740
 Jesus was standing at the head of Threescore Eagleguard. The young warrior had been recently

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:26.940
 promoted to High Captain of the Fairs Warband now that Veridus was gone. Ah, Veridus. Are

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:33.300
 you dead or alive, old friend? It does not seem right that you are not beside me to share

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:39.460
 in this great victory. He had been informed of Veridus's betrayal, his attempt on Calidus's

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:43.100
 life and he and Althean's escape.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:51.300
 Veridus. How could you abandon me, break your oath to me? He looked at the white scars on

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:56.500
 the palm of his hand, one of them made as a blood oath of brotherhood to Veridus on

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:03.500
 a moonlit hillside in Tenebrel. It felt like a lifetime ago, words and promises spoken

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:13.640
 by different people. "My king," Cesar said. "It is Calidus. He asks for you."

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.340
 Nefear looked back at the skeleton one last time, then turned and strode through the huge

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:25.700
 chamber. The dead were still being cleared from the battle of the day before. Blood stained

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:34.020
 the stone floor. Mounds of corpses lay in stinking piles. Hundreds of them—Kadashim,

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:42.140
 Jeha, Venthalan, Eagleguard, Banothi Giants, many others. The cost of taking Drassil had

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:46.460
 been high, higher than he would have imagined considering that the element of surprise had

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:56.980
 been on their side. But victory is victory. The fortress is ours, the back of our enemy,

00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:03.740
 broken. Though many had escaped, reports were coming in of pitched battles still being fought

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:09.340
 beyond the walls of Drassil. Nefear glanced to his right as he passed an open trapdoor

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:15.380
 as wide as the gates of Geralin and the dark stain of blood on the stone before it.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:22.660
 Michael's blood. The Ben Elim's head now adorned a spear set in the ground of the courtyard

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:30.860
 before the gates of Drassil. It was not alone. But what of Corbin, their bright star? Where

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:36.920
 is he? He glared mistrustfully into the yawning dark of the tunnel, knew that Michael had chosen

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:42.540
 to stand and fight there to gain time for many who escaped into the tunnel. Was Corbin

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:49.180
 one of them? There had been no reports of Corbin being seen during the battle. Had he

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:55.060
 even been here? It had been a long night and Nefear felt a greater weariness settling upon

00:20:55.060 --> 00:21:00.940
 him than he had ever known before. Caesar snapped an order behind him and Eagleguard

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:07.540
 spread to either side, forming a protective column. "Drassil is not yet secure," Caesar

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:13.940
 said in reply to Nefear's inquiring look. The courtyard also bore the signs of yesterday's

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:21.840
 battle, bodies scattered all about, flies buzzing, the metallic aroma of blood everywhere.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:27.340
 For an instant, Nefear thought he saw a wolfen cub tugging at the leg of a dead caddishim,

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:33.860
 but looking back realised it was a small white furred dog. They turned a corner in a street

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:38.300
 and Nefear glimpsed the towering outer walls of Drassil beyond the layers of stone buildings

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:46.640
 latticed with thick branches. This is a truly remarkable place. Branches soared above him

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:51.440
 as thick as towers, with buildings of stone and iron wrapped about them bound tighter

00:21:51.440 --> 00:22:02.860
 than leather armour. It looks almost alive. The tree, the bones, the fortress, its flesh.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:07.740
 The rasp of a sword drawn from its scabbard drew his attention and he glimpsed the black-clothed

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:13.920
 warrior hurtling from the shadows of a doorway. Abruptly, Caesar was yelling as more dark

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:20.820
 figures emerged, iron glinting. The Eagleguard moved, shields thudding together around the

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:27.220
 fair obscuring his view. Blood sprayed, spattering the fair's face as an Eagleguard before him

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:33.780
 collapsed. A black-clothed Jihar slipped into the gap carved in the shield wall, surging

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:40.820
 towards Nefear. Nefear drew his sword, fear and rage his constant companions igniting within

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:46.420
 him. The shouts and screams of battle faded, his world contracting to the Jihar warrior

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:53.340
 before him. A woman, her dark-skinned face all sharp bones almost fragile looking.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:23:00.340
 "Truth and courage!" she yelled, curved sword rising.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:04.500
 There was an explosion of sparks as their weapons met, the power of the Jihar's strike

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:12.500
 making the tendons of his wrist shriek, shuddering on into his arm and shoulder. He pushed forwards,

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:17.700
 knowing to retreat was to die, tried to move within her guard, use his short sword where

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:24.460
 her longer blade would hinder her. They collided, limbs tangling as both crashed to the ground,

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:28.700
 wrestling, punching, kicking and biting at each other as they rolled back and forth across

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:33.140
 the stone street, with a battle raging all about them.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:37.980
 The Jihar struck a glancing blow that made his vision blur, then her knee crunched into

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:43.180
 his groin and he slumped, pain exploding, pulsing through him in savage waves, draining

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:49.060
 his strength. She pulled herself free and half rose as he coughed into the cold stone,

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:56.580
 tried to rise, knew if he didn't, he was dead. Fear and rage sparked inside him, sent new

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:02.140
 energy coursing through his veins. "I'll not die here."

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:09.300
 The Jihar stood over him, sword raised, her eyes bright with victory. Then a form crashed

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:14.900
 into her, throwing her to the ground. She started to rise and a boot slammed into her

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:21.980
 jaw, sent her crashing back down. The figure was blurred, a buzzing cloud swirling about

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:27.540
 it. Hands gripped him and pulled him upright, says as his concerned face appeared, blood

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:33.300
 sheeting from a long cut across his forehead. Nefert looked past him, saw his rescuer pull

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:39.620
 a sword from a scabbard upon its back and raised it over the unconscious Jihar. "A kaddashim?"

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:46.620
 "No," Nefert called. The figure's head turned to look at him, the buzzing cloud parting.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:57.140
 "Flies," Nefert realized, recognizing the kaddashim. "No, Legion. I want her alive."

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:05.440
 The kaddashim regarded him for a moment with cold black eyes. "Better dead," it said. "I

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:14.620
 want her alive." Nefert snapped. "Kalidas may have questions." "Dead after, then,"

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:22.500
 the kaddashim said, then sheathing its sword. "Kalidas wants you."

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:27.220
 The flesh of its face and neck rippled, seeming to move of its own accord as if something

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:35.340
 were locked within, trying to get out. About them, the battle seemed almost done. Nefert

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:40.500
 scanned the street, counted nearly a score of his eagle guard dead to five or six of

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:46.540
 their Jihar attackers. "This part of Jassil is supposed to have been cleared," he snarled.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:52.420
 "How did they get in here?" He looked down at the unconscious Jihar's form at Legion's

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:58.020
 feet. "Bring her," Nefert said as he marched away.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:03.480
 As Nefert entered the courtyard before Jassil's gates, he heard a rumbling growl reverberate

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.380
 from one of the many stables that edged the courtyard. He looked fondly at the doors that

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:14.620
 contained his drake. Kalidas stood before the closed gates of Jassil, to either side

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:19.900
 of him were a host of spears driven into the ground, most of them adorned with a head.

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:25.460
 A handful of Venthalan warriors were planting new spears into the ground, while behind them

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:32.700
 Kalishim prowled into the courtyard's shadows. Before Kalidas knelt a ragged group of people

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:40.540
 bound at wrist and ankle, over three hundred prisoners from yesterday's battle. Above them,

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:45.700
 one guard stood upon Jassil's wars. "My warriors."

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:50.420
 They were easily the best disciplined troops amongst those that had stormed Jassil. The

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:55.600
 Kalishim and many of Lycus's Venthalan were involved in the pursuit of their scattered

00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:01.660
 enemy out beyond Jassil's wars, but Nefert suspected that most by far were ranging throughout

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:07.700
 the forest, looting and drinking. The Kalishim were doing other things, such as eating their

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:16.460
 victims. Lycus was standing behind Kalidas. A dozen Venthalan ranged about him, hard-looking

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:23.820
 men, bodies lean and muscular, skin weathered and scarred. Lycus lifted a waterskin to his

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:30.100
 mouth and took a long drink. "I'd wager it's not water that he's drinking."

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:36.460
 The Venthalan saw him approaching and nodded a greeting. Nefert hid his disgust. "Him and

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:43.540
 my mother." "Ah, Nefert," Kalidas said. He raised an

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:49.020
 eyebrow at the blood on Nefert's face, then saw Legion dragging the Jihar warrior across

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:56.900
 the courtyard by her ankle. "Kalidas?" Nefert said, with a dip of his head.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:02.500
 His old counsellor was not looking his best. Part of his face was burned charcoal black

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:08.100
 and peeling. Silver hair was growing in tufts from patches on his head, elsewhere singed

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:12.780
 to stubble or burned clear. "It would appear that the streets of Drassil

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:19.140
 are not yet cleared of our enemy," Nefert said sourly, as Legion dumped the Jihar warrior

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:24.940
 in front of Kalidas. She groaned, pushing herself to her knees as Legion's hand clamped

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:33.380
 on her shoulder, holding her before Kalidas. "What is your name, child?" Kalidas asked,

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:38.700
 regarding her with his cold eyes. She spat blood at Kalidas's feet and glowered

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:44.780
 up at him. "Ilta," the Jihar said. "And I am no child."

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:54.140
 "Well, Ilta, I shall ask you the same question that I have just put to your comrades. Where

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:59.680
 is Corban?" "You will see him soon enough," a voice said,

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:03.940
 from amongst the prisoners. "He will come for you."

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:09.780
 "And when he does," said Ilta, as she turned her head to look from Kalidas to Nefert and

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:18.300
 Lycos, "he will kill you all." "He is a boy, a puppet. Your ill master is

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:24.260
 already slain," Kalidas said angrily, sweeping a hand towards Michael's head.

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:32.160
 "You are wrong," Ilta said. "Koban is our lord. He slew your best, Sumur, in single

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.340
 combat. We all saw it. He will do the same to you."

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:42.500
 "Sumur," Kalidas frowned. "I saw his head decorating your gates."

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:51.540
 "Corban killed him," the prisoner's voice called out again, one vaguely familiar to Nefert.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:58.660
 "A figure straightened amongst the captives black hair hanging lank about her face. He

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:07.860
 took Sumur's head, and he will take yours, too." "Ah, Cohen, I want nothing more than

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:13.660
 for him to come and try," Kalidas said with a sigh, his expression mocking, but Nefert

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:21.180
 glimpsed something else in his eyes. "Doubt?" "But so far, he does not seem inclined to

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:28.700
 do so," Kalidas continued. "Perhaps a message will speed him to us."

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:35.660
 He looked to the Kalidasim. "Legion, choose one prisoner and impale them upon a spear,"

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:42.340
 he ordered. Legion drabbed Cohen and pulled her, struggling towards a spear. "Not her,"

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:49.420
 Kalidas said with a wave of his hand. Legion grabbed another prisoner. He was a man of

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:54.900
 Izeltir by the look of him. The Kalidasim hoisted him effortlessly into the air and brought

00:30:54.900 --> 00:31:03.540
 him down slowly upon the upright spear. Then the screaming began. When it was over, the

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:09.400
 prisoner was skewered like a squirrel, ready for the cook fire. He was writhing upon the

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:15.880
 spear, blood pooling about his feet, screaming himself to oblivion. Nefert resisted the urge

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:24.060
 to cover his ears. "On your feet," Kalidas said to Iltar. "Go and tell Corban what is

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:29.980
 happening to his followers, what I am doing. Tell him I will not stop until he has faced

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:34.500
 me." Legion pushed her stumbling forwards as, with

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:41.940
 a rumble, the gates opened. She looked back once and then ran, the gates slamming behind

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:49.220
 her. Kalidas barked in order and the remaining captives were led away. Cohen caught Nefert's

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:53.180
 eye as she walked in line, hatred pouring from her.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:32:01.980
 "We must talk soon," Kalidas said to Nefert and Lycos. "Hi, son, and the Great Hall."

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.740
 Then he was striding away.

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:10.620
 Lycos raised an eyebrow and offered Nefert his water-skin. Without thinking, Nefert took

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:17.640
 it and drank, then coughed, almost choking on the contents. "Is that . . . mead," Lycos

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:25.180
 finished for him, found a dozen wagons with barrels full of the stuff. Nefert handed it

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:31.380
 back to him and Lycos walked away, chuckling to himself, his Venthallan following him.

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:38.420
 Nefert headed for the wide stairs that scaled Drassil's walls and climbed to the top, stopping

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:42.980
 above the great gates where he stared out at the world beyond.

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:48.180
 A wide plain circled the fortress, clear blue sky bathing the ground in sunshine before

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:52.140
 the great trees of fawn blotted it from view.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:58.300
 He caught a glimpse of Ilta just before she disappeared into the tree-line. Behind him,

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:04.620
 he heard the footsteps of Cesus and his eagle-guard stopping a respectful distance away. The screams

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:10.820
 of the impaled in the courtyard were much fainter up here, fading to a pathetic mewling.

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:16.500
 He wished he would just die. "How have I allowed myself to come to this?"

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:23.860
 "It is for the greater good. For me to win the war, Corbin must die. To bring peace to

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:28.020
 the banished lands, Corbin must die."

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:32.860
 He felt his resolve stir, but still the screams wormed their way into his head, reminding

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:36.740
 him of other battles, other deaths in the name of this great cause.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:45.380
 "And now I follow the path of Karushim, of demons, of As-Roth himself."

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:49.260
 He remembered Caledus' words to him in Murias, so persuasive.

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:56.260
 It had all been so logical when Caledus explained it, made sense of the alliances, the lies,

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.740
 deception upon deception, heaped in a great pile.

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:04.980
 "But the truth is simpler," a voice seemed to whisper inside his mind.

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.940
 Deep down, he knew.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:12.660
 It was more basic when all was stripped away. Caledus' persuasive arguments and philosophical

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:17.780
 debates on good and evil, right and wrong, the abstract meanings that were attached to

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:22.900
 names, politics, power struggles, who deserved what.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:27.100
 The honest answer was much simpler than any of those meandering debates, and one that

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:31.740
 had been clearly reinforced by his brief struggle with the Jihad warrior before him.

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:38.140
 "I don't want to lose."

00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:39.900
 CHAPTER 3

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:40.900
 Coraline

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:49.580
 Coraline sat with her back to a tree, staring into the dawn gloom of fawn, absently twirling

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:52.820
 a knife between her fingers.

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:56.140
 Behind her were the sleeping forms of three score or so of the survivors with whom she

00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:59.060
 had fled Drassil.

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:04.980
 Across them was Brinna, gray hair poking from beneath her cloak. Beside her, the bolts of

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:09.260
 Feral and Laith curled close together.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:15.820
 She glimpsed the Jihad, Akar, standing guard on the far side of their camp. Exhaustion

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:20.340
 hovered at the fringes of her consciousness and, in so many ways, it would be wonderful

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:23.020
 to lose herself in the nothingness of sleep.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.820
 But she couldn't.

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:30.780
 Her mind was reeling, a whirlwind of grief, fear and rage as fractured moments of the

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.500
 previous day played out in her mind's eye.

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:43.020
 Out of them all, though, everything kept returning to one thought, circling, "Where is Corbin?"

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:47.980
 The fog of tiredness crept upon her again, a relentless assault, but she knew that sleep

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:53.740
 would not come, the shock and horror of yesterday's battle was still too present.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:36:00.700
 There was a soft footfall from behind and a figure came to stand beside her – Gar.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:05.340
 The lord of the Jihad looked at her, lines of worry etched upon his usually unreadable

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:07.140
 face.

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:12.500
 He was clothed in a shirt of dark chain mail, splattered with grime and blood, his curved

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:18.360
 sword sheathed across his back, a single bladed throwing axe hanging at his belt.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:23.700
 Then he was not free of injury, a blood-stained bandage was tied around his forehead.

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:29.660
 "Storm is with him," Gar said, as if he could read her thoughts.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:34.820
 "They must be as plain to read upon my face as are his."

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:35.820
 Storm.

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:39.260
 "That was a measure of comfort."

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:45.100
 Corbin knew that the wolfen was a better guardian than a dozen shieldmen, but still, "We will

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:48.340
 find him," Gar said.

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:52.940
 Corbin had seen the familiar scuff marks of Storm's claws in the tunnel, which was why

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.420
 they had exited at this spot.

00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:01.420
 After a brief search, she'd found more tracks leading to the brow of the slope, but darkness

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:05.620
 has settled upon them and no matter how frustrating, it was pointless to stumble around in the

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:06.620
 dark.

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:10.700
 "But where can Corbin be?"

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:16.500
 He must have heard the din of battle from Drassil, even if he were this far away.

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:21.740
 The thoughts rose unbidden in her mind, the one thought she had refused to acknowledge

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.980
 throughout the long dark of night.

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:27.680
 What if he is slain?

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.460
 What else could have kept him from returning to Drassil?

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:36.020
 She felt a worm of fear wriggling through her belly but refused to consider it.

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:38.260
 "He lives."

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.140
 He must.

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:46.700
 She nodded and stood, sheathing her knife, a myriad of cuts, bruises, and strains aching

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:48.740
 for attention.

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.260
 She ignored them all.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:54.580
 "We need to go," she said.

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:58.020
 "Aye," Gar agreed.

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.380
 He continued to stare at the trapdoor.

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:06.820
 "I had hoped that Michael would find us, that he escaped."

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:12.460
 Corbin remembered her last sight of the Ben-el-Im, wielding his sword two-handed, feet planted

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:16.020
 before the entrance to the tunnel in Drassil's great hall as they had retreated into its

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.820
 shadows.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:23.900
 Swaths of blood had surrounded him as he swung his sword in deadly arcs, holding back the

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:26.940
 enemy, protecting them, purchasing them time to escape.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:33.580
 "He would have come by now, if he could," Corbin said.

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.740
 Gar sighed and nodded.

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:41.800
 Corbin cocked her head, listening, staring down the hill.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:46.260
 Something was moving in the undergrowth, heading towards the trapdoor.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:50.180
 Gar saw it, too, and without words the two of them separated, slipping into the shadows

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:54.260
 as they quietly surrounded the intruder.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:39:00.020
 Bushes rustled, a twig snapped, and Corbin caught a glimpse of dark hair.

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:01.860
 She knew it wasn't Corbin.

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.580
 Even he isn't that clumsy.

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:09.980
 A figure burst from the undergrowth, a young man clad in leather and wool, his dark hair

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:14.580
 tousled and a scabbing cut marking his forehead.

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:19.020
 He started at the sight of her, fumbled for a weapon at his belt, his eyes widening.

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:24.780
 "I know you," Corbin said, though she didn't remember his name.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:32.460
 "Your da is Attilius," a competent, unassuming warrior, Attilius had been a slave oarsman

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:35.420
 on a Vinthalen ship.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:38.500
 The lad nodded, his lip trembling.

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:42.540
 "Pax, what are you doing here?"

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:47.780
 Gar said, stepping silently from the shadows, making the young warrior jump again.

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:51.180
 "You must come quickly," Pax blurted.

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:52.180
 "My da!

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:53.180
 Corbin!

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.180
 Giants!"

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:56.180
 "Corbin?"

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:57.180
 Corbin hissed.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.180
 "Aye!

00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.120
 We must go!"

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:05.100
 Gar was spilling down Pax's cheeks now, tracing tracks through blood and grime.

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:08.180
 "He's dead."

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:12.620
 Corbin froze, feeling as if a fist had just clamped around her heart.

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:16.540
 "I ran," Pax said.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:21.580
 He began to shake, an involuntary twitching that quickly became more violent.

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:24.900
 "Where is Corbin?"

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:28.820
 Corbin asked, trying to control the panic leaking through her, reaching out to grab

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:32.340
 the now sobbing boy and shake the scents from him.

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:37.420
 "Hold," Gar said, putting a hand upon her arm.

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:41.020
 "Pax, you must tell us as clearly as you can.

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:42.580
 Where is Corbin and Yoda?

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.980
 What happened?"

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:49.880
 Others were coming down the hill now, corralling glimpse dath and color, a handful of jihar

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.900
 lath looming behind them.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:57.620
 "We heard, fighting, knew Corbin was out there," Pax began, haltingly.

00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:59.980
 "We found him, facing giants and bears."

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:00.980
 "What?"

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:05.100
 "But there were no giants within the fair at Drassil."

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:06.100
 "Dah!

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:09.060
 He threw a spear at a giant, then we all ran.

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.220
 We thought we'd lost them.

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.220
 Then—"

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:14.020
 "Go on," Gar said.

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:18.660
 The whole group was gathered around them now, listening in absolute silence.

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:24.100
 "They came from nowhere, my dah."

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.140
 He rubbed his eyes, blew out a long breath.

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:31.780
 "They killed my dah.

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.220
 Corbin told me to run to fetch help."

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:36.620
 "When did this happen?"

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:40.340
 Gar asked, not able to keep the urgency from his voice.

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:44.900
 "Yesterday, after High Sun before sunset."

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.660
 Pax's face had grown paler as he spoke.

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.060
 Now he looked like a corpse.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:50.220
 "I ran.

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:53.340
 I fell, hit my head."

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.740
 He raised a hand to the cut on his brow.

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:58.980
 "When I came to, it was dark.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:01.940
 I've been trying to find my way since then."

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.900
 "Take us, now," Gar said.

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:07.140
 "I will try," Pax nodded.

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:13.100
 "I became lost for a while, but I know it was that direction."

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:17.900
 Gar barked orders and then they were moving, Corbin taking the lead with Pax, Gar jogging

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:22.060
 beside the lad, a steadying hand on his arm.

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:28.180
 Then storm, facing giants, alone, yesterday.

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:32.620
 She sent a silent prayer to Elion, one of many that she had made over the last half

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:33.620
 day.

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:37.660
 "Let them still live."

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.020
 Corbin was the first to enter the Glade.

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:45.700
 At its far end was a sudden ridge, and beyond it, the sound of a fast flowing river.

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:51.060
 The smell hit her first, the metallic tang of blood and decay.

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:52.500
 Death.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:57.380
 Flies were buzzing in great clouds about bodies heaped on the floor.

00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:03.060
 She counted three giant corpses on the ground, and Atilius, pinned to a great oak by a giant's

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.700
 axe.

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:07.420
 She could not see Corbin or Storm.

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:12.060
 She ran to the first giant, who was on his back, a hole in his belly, throat cleanly

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:17.780
 cut, his wrist bearing the tell-tale ripping wounds of the wolfen.

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:23.060
 Corbin moved on, dimly aware of others spilling into the Glade behind her, the sound of Pax's

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:29.140
 sobs as he dropped to his knees before his dar, Gar's presence at her shoulder.

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:34.480
 The other two giants were close together, the ground trampled, rutted, dark and still

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:37.140
 sticky with blood.

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:42.860
 One's throat had been ripped out by Storm, the flesh mangled and torn.

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:46.320
 He is not here, nor Storm.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:49.980
 The relief was a physical thing, though she knew their absence did not mean that they

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:55.580
 were safe or even alive, but it was clear they had fought here and won.

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:58.980
 They slew three giants.

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:03.980
 She felt a flush of pride at that feat, knew that it would be a story told around the campfire

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:08.020
 this very night, adding to the tales that were growing up around Corbin and his wolfen

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:10.220
 companion.

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.380
 The other giant lay upon his front.

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:18.740
 Gar and Corbin tried to turn him over together, flies buzzed angrily, the huge warriors' dead

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:21.540
 weight like a boulder.

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:26.020
 Farrell and Laith joined them, and together they rolled the giant, the stench of corruption

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:28.820
 and decay wafting up to them as they disturbed the body.

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:35.300
 "He is of the Jotun clan," Laith spat as they stood and stared at the dead giant.

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:39.340
 "What are they doing here?"

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:43.820
 Corbin's eyes were drawn to the glint of leather and iron amidst the congealed blood.

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:48.260
 She bent and wrapped a fist around the hilt of a sword buried deep in the giant's thigh,

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:50.020
 angled upwards into its groin.

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:55.740
 It came free with a sucking sound, and she lifted it for them all to see, the pommel

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:58.420
 shaped like a howling wolfen.

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:02.820
 The relief she'd felt fled, replaced by the crushing weight of fear.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:07.260
 "That's Ban's sword," Dath said as he joined them.

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:10.860
 Collar, a pace behind him.

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:14.500
 Corbin stared at them a moment, felt a wave of sympathy for them.

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:18.580
 They'd been weighed less than two nights.

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:20.860
 Gar took the sword from her and stared at it.

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:24.580
 "I watched Ban's da give him this blade."

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:29.860
 "In the rowan field at Duncarig," Farrell said, "I remember it."

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:31.860
 "And I?"

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:34.300
 Dath muttered.

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:38.740
 Ban turned away, her eyes scanning the ground, searching for any sign.

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:40.980
 "He is not here.

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:42.740
 Storm is not here.

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:47.020
 They escaped, but they did not make their way back to Drassil.

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:48.780
 Why?"

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:51.660
 Brinner was on her knees beside the giant.

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:55.780
 The old healer had a file in one hand, a knife in the other that she was using to scrape

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:58.980
 blood from the trampled grass.

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:03.980
 One side of Brinner's face was still an angry red, seared by the explosions she had generated

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:07.620
 that had rocked the chamber in Drassil yesterday.

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:13.200
 Whatever benefit Brinner thought the giant's blood would bring, she was welcome to it.

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:18.140
 As Coraline scanned the rest of the clearing, her eyes caught a patch of crushed grass spattered

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:19.980
 with blood.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:25.780
 It was close to the edge of the glade, leading to a sheer drop to the river below.

00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:29.100
 As if something were dragged.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:34.820
 She followed the marks and dropped to a crouch, looking down to the river.

00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:38.860
 Further down she spied a dark smear on a boulder, blood.

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:43.580
 "They jumped into the river!" she called out.

00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:45.940
 Gar was first to join her.

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:49.420
 His eyes found the same evidence and he gripped her wrist.

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:53.620
 "After them!" he said.

00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:58.740
 Coraline led the way, running along the ridge that shadowed the river, twisting around thick-rooted

00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:03.420
 trees in dense vegetation, her eyes flitting between the path she was navigating and the

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:06.340
 banks of the river.

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:11.620
 Rounding a sharp bend in the path, she suddenly saw a shape lying on a grassy verge, firm

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:14.500
 ated and blood-stained.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.500
 Her heart stopped.

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.660
 "Storm!"

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:23.220
 She skidded to a halt on the ridge above the wolfen, a part of her mind noticing large boot

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:25.620
 prints in the grass.

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:30.580
 In a spray of dirt, she scrambled over the edge, clinging to root and vine as she made

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.940
 her way down to the riverbank.

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:39.180
 Storm lay still as stone, and she was covered in blood, a huge wound was visible above her

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.620
 shoulder.

00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:45.700
 Coraline crouched, too scared to touch her, not wanting to confirm what her eyes were

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:48.300
 telling her.

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:52.860
 Stifling tears, she remembered the first time she had seen Storm, when she had threatened

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:56.140
 to turn the wolfen into a cloak.

00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:01.720
 Even then she had seen the bond between Coraline and his faithful and vigilant shadow.

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:06.460
 Since then, she had developed her own bond with the wolfen, more like a sword-brother

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.300
 to her than a mere animal.

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:14.980
 As Gar joined her, she tentatively reached out her hand and laid it upon Storm's body.

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:16.580
 She felt nothing.

00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:20.700
 "No, please, Elion above."

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:27.360
 She screwed her eyes shut tight, pressed harder, flattening her palm against Storm's deep chest,

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:33.220
 willing her hand to feel the movement of life, a drawn breath, the pumping of Storm's heart.

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:38.340
 With every moment, her hopes faded, a bleakness taking hold inside, spreading through her

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.940
 like ink through water.

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:42.380
 And then?

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:43.380
 She felt it.

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:48.780
 A flicker, a heartbeat deep within the cavern of Storm's broad chest.

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:52.580
 Then opened her eyes and saw Storm's amber gaze regarding her.

00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:58.860
 The wolfen whined, a weak, miserable sound, but one that gave Coraline a rush of joy.

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:05.660
 Storm's tail thumped feebly on the turf.

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:10.620
 Chapter 4 Corbin

00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:15.020
 Corbin walked through a world of grey, dimly aware that he was staggering close to a wide

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:17.140
 and dark river.

00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:21.620
 There was a splash and a wide ripple, the hint of something large and sinuous in its

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:23.420
 depths.

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:28.700
 Bloated dark clouds boiled above him, flickering with lightning, and black shapes winged through

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:32.500
 them with an occasional gleam of chainmail and iron.

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:35.420
 This is the other world.

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:41.580
 His knee throbbed and a pain spasm through his chest with every in-drawn breath.

00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:46.300
 He fixed his eyes on the ground before him, concentrating on each step.

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:50.200
 There had always been an element of the other world that calmed him, a serenity that settled

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:54.220
 within him that gave him a sense of strength and hope.

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:56.480
 But this time was different.

00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:59.020
 There was something frayed about the peacefulness.

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:01.560
 It felt force.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:07.460
 Something lurked at the fringes of his mind, trying, needing to be remembered.

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:12.620
 When next he looked up, the river was flowing into a valley, cliffs rearing up by the side

00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:15.740
 of him tall and forbidding.

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:19.340
 Inside of him, the river spilt into a lake.

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:22.940
 Vibrant colour was seeping into the landscape with every step into the valley.

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:29.740
 The grass grew greener, the river bluer, as if colour was seeping up from the rock below.

00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:33.820
 I know this place had been here before.

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:37.220
 The green valley and the lake of deep blue.

00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:40.140
 Gentle waves lapped against the shore.

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:45.500
 A sound drew Corbin's eye towards the lake's heart, a splash and ripples, as if a stone

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.380
 had been thrown into water.

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:52.460
 His memory prodded at him and his eyes wandered back to the lakeshore, searching for something

00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:55.140
 else and then he saw it.

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:59.540
 The red-leafed maple that he had once sat beneath.

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:04.500
 Without thinking, he made his way to it and sat down, his back to the trunk.

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:10.220
 Everything was still, no breeze to stir the grass or leaves, no hum of insects.

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:12.900
 The silence was oppressive.

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:19.380
 And then, high above, like a heartbeat, there was a beat of wings.

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:23.680
 He glanced up through the lattice of leaf and bark and saw a figure silhouetted against

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:29.460
 the clouds, human-like, a spear clutched in one hand, broad, white-feathered wings powering

00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:32.060
 it through the air.

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:38.420
 The Ben-Elim, Michael, Michael.

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:42.260
 Then, like an avalanche, he remembered.

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:47.300
 Michael, in the great hall of Drassil, telling Corbin about the deception of the Ben-Elim,

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:52.420
 how the prophecy was nothing more than a strategy, a trick to force Asroth's hand to lure Calidus

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:54.980
 and the Karashim to Drassil.

00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:59.900
 That the bright star and black sun were an invention, fabricated to snare Asroth in a

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:02.380
 trap of his own making.

00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:07.540
 A sound strategy, maybe, in the great war between Ben-Elim and Karashim, the faithful

00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:14.380
 and the fallen, apart from the fact that it used people's lives like pawns on a throwboard.

00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:19.420
 My daar's life, my ma'am's, so many others.

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:25.800
 Rage swept through him, veined with betrayal at the memory of Michael's confession.

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:29.740
 He remembered resisting the urge to strike Michael, then leaving, knowing his rage was

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:34.540
 at the boundaries of his control, and had ended up sitting upon a hill in the forest.

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:40.500
 He had sat there a long time, contemplating Michael's words, trying to make some sense

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:43.620
 of what it would mean for the future.

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:52.540
 And then the Jotun giants had come, Ildar, their warlord, Slayer of Tuckle, Ghaz Da.

00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:58.860
 Images flickered through his mind, a bear roaring, spittle spraying from its red moor,

00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:03.740
 running, foliage whipping his face, the thunder of the bear's pursuit, the wounds to his knee

00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:10.520
 and chest, a spear piercing Storm, a river, ice-cold water.

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:15.020
 Storm howling as giants had dragged him away from her side.

00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:16.460
 Storm.

00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:20.620
 Pain shuddered through Corbin's chest as if someone were gripping his heart, squeezing

00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:22.100
 and twisting it.

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:24.900
 He couldn't breathe.

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:27.780
 His sorrow was a physical thing that crushed the air from his lungs.

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:32.900
 He staggered towards the lake, dropping to his knees at the water's edge.

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:38.380
 And as he did so, more memories flooded his mind, an unstoppable wave of drassil, the

00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:43.220
 frantic blowing of horns and sound of battle that had drifted up to him.

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:50.460
 Images of his loved ones swam before his eyes, Coraline, Gaar, Cohen, Dath and Farrell, Brynna,

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.940
 so many others.

00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:54.740
 Do they still live?

00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:57.140
 Who was attacking drassil?

00:53:57.140 --> 00:54:01.980
 Dimly, he became aware of movement.

00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:07.140
 Around him, the water of the lake started to shift and foam, something rising from the

00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:08.140
 depths.

00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:15.140
 A shape appeared, water cascading and masking for a moment the creature within.

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:20.220
 Then a man was striding from the lake, with water dripping from the dark cloak that trailed

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:22.500
 him like seaweed.

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:26.900
 He approached Corbin, an interested, amicable smile upon his face.

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:29.420
 His skin was grey-mottled and veined like a dead thing.

00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:32.340
 His hair was black and slick as oil.

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:36.220
 A black scabbarded sword hung at his hip.

00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:43.160
 "Well," the man said, "it's not often that I get visitors."

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:47.580
 His voice was liquid, flowing like a shallow stream over shingle.

00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:51.260
 "What brings you to my home?"

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:55.660
 "I, I've been here before," Corbin said.

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:59.860
 "I know, I've watched you."

00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:03.260
 "This is the other world," Corbin said.

00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:10.980
 "It is, and this lake, this tree, this valley," the dark-haired man said with a wave of his

00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:14.300
 hands, "are mine."

00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:17.460
 He shrugged, water dripped from his hair.

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:21.000
 "Are you Ben Ellum?"

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000
 Corbin asked.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.460
 The man laughed, a damp exhalation.

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:30.260
 "Those pompous fools, no, though to my shame we are related."

00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:34.140
 "Carashim," Corbin asked, fearful.

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:39.660
 "Hardly," the man snorted, "those fawning debauch deviants.

00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:42.060
 Do I look like one of them?"

00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:44.100
 "No," Corbin admitted.

00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:49.980
 "Well, then, I am just me, Viathan."

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:55.260
 He lifted his hands, held one up to the sky, splayed his fingers.

00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:58.340
 Corbin saw that they were webbed like a frog's feet.

00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:03.220
 "You are from the world of flesh, are you not?"

00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:04.860
 The man said.

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:06.460
 Corbin nodded wearily.

00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:12.660
 "And what is your name, creature of flesh?"

00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:18.900
 Viathan asked him, leaning in uncomfortably close, his breath washing over Corbin moist

00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:22.060
 and full of rot.

00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:23.880
 Corbin did not want to tell him.

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:30.260
 "I'm going to go now," he said, standing, wanting to be far away from his creature.

00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:34.020
 "I don't think so," Viathan sighed.

00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:42.260
 "I think we should continue this conversation somewhere a little more private."

00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:45.180
 Corbin backed away, turning to leave.

00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:47.260
 Something grabbed his ankle.

00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:51.500
 Looking down, he saw that it was a tendril of Viathan's cloak, flexing like a grasping

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:52.900
 limb.

00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:56.240
 It wrapped itself around his leg as Viathan walked back towards the lake.

00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:02.500
 Then, with shocking strength, the cloak pulled tight and started dragging Corbin.

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:07.380
 For a moment, Corbin was too shocked to resist, but then he scrambled back, yanking at his

00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:09.980
 ankle, hand grasping for his sword.

00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:15.820
 "Come on, don't dally," Viathan called over his shoulder as he reached the lake.

00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:19.780
 He walked in, sinking rapidly.

00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:25.300
 The cloak seemed to split to flow, forming a myriad of strands, reaching up to Corbin,

00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:29.220
 each one contracting around his ankles, wrists and throat.

00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:35.020
 Then, he was being pulled down to the lakeshore, trussed like a fly in a spider's web into

00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:36.900
 the water.

00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:41.180
 Panic filled him as his head sank beneath the surface and he struggled desperately,

00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:45.260
 straining veins bulging, muscles screaming.

00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:50.020
 With a sinew tearing effort, he pulled one arm free and then he was bursting out of the

00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:54.780
 water, hoisted into the air, dangling before the creature, held up by his dark cloak that

00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:59.100
 looked now more like a squirming nest of snakes.

00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:04.620
 Corbin gasped for breath, ripping at the cloak strands, enclosing him to little effect.

00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:06.860
 Viathan regarded him with a cold fascination.

00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:14.340
 "Tell me your name," Viathan said, anger swelling in his voice the crash of waves upon rocks.

00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:18.820
 "Let me go," Corbin grunted through his constricted chest.

00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:26.180
 "You have trespassed here, disturbed my rest," Viathan said wetly as he pulled Corbin closer.

00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:37.220
 "In return, I will have some answers, and then, after, I may see how you taste."

00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:40.820
 A wave of found breath engulfed Corbin, making his stomach lurch.

00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:42.740
 "What are you?"

00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:43.740
 Corbin coughed.

00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:51.660
 "I am Viathan," the creature said, his mouth opening wide, seeming to grow before Corbin's

00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:58.020
 eyes wider and wider, revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth glistening and dripping with mucus.

00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:03.660
 "Eater of souls."

00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:09.700
 There was a whistling sound, and a spear slammed into Viathan's cloak, piercing it.

00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:13.580
 Corbin screamed as Ben-Elim swept down from the sky.

00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:17.200
 More spears flew, stabbing into Viathan's body.

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:22.300
 His yell deepened into a bellow of pain and rage, and Corbin found himself thrown to the

00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:26.940
 ground as the creature turned its attention to its attackers.

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:31.420
 Then hands were grasping Corbin, and he was hoisted into the air again.

00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:37.980
 There was a Ben-Elim either side of him surging skywards, their wings beating hard.

00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:43.220
 When heartbeats the conflict in the lake was below them, Viathan and his living cloak sinking

00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:49.980
 into the water, one strand coiling around a Ben-Elim, dragging it beneath the surface.

00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:55.380
 The Ben-Elim's scream cut short as the water closed over its head.

00:59:55.380 --> 01:00:00.420
 They flew higher, following the course of a winding valley, twisting and turning amongst

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   "Roth, Book IV of the Faithful and the Fallen" by John Gwynne, read by Damien Lynch
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   "Roth and Vengeance Poured" John Milton, Paradise Lost
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Chapter 1 "Veritus"
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   The year 1144 of the Age of Exiles, Hound Moon
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Veridis fell through the night air, weightless.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   He caught glimpses of the Tower of Brickhan, Calidus's still smoldering outline at the window, then below, the river coming up to meet him.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   He slammed into the water, the cold shocking the breath out of him.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   He panicked, disorientated, realizing he didn't know which way was up.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   All about him was darkness and ice.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Then something grabbed his hair, and he was surging upwards, breaking through the water in a burst of spray, and saw Alcyon's pale broad face staring back at him.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   "They will come hunting for us," the giant shouted over the roar of the river as the current gripped them, sweeping them away from the thunder of warrior's feet crossing the bridge.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   "Let the water take us far from them."
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Veridis saw the sense of that, though his hands and feet were already numbing from the cold.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   He put some effort into swimming, speeding his way from Brickhan, from Calidus, from the Kadashim.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   The thought still jolted him like a blow.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   They turned a bend in the river, and the fortress was gone, darkness enfolding them.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   The soft, weak sheen of dawn's gray light filtered down through the lattice of branches above as Veridis met Alcyon's gaze, an unspoken agreement passing between them as they both headed for the riverbank.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   It was harder going, swimming across the current, and Veridis realized how exhausted his body was, but eventually he felt silt beneath his feet, his hands grasping at reeds as he pulled himself out of the water and flopped onto his back, gasping, his limbs feeling lead-filled.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Turning, he saw Alcyon on the bank, thirty or forty paces upriver from him, staggering wearily towards him before he slumped down beside him with a groan, water dripping from his drooping mustache.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   "Thank you," Alcyon said.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   "For what?"
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   "Everything. Most of all for helping my family escape Brickhan's dungeons."
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   His wife and Bern.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   How long has he gone without seeing them?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And what must he have suffered, knowing they were Callidus and Lycus's prisoners?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   "And for destroying Callidus's effigy of me," Alcyon continued. "You have set me free."
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   He gave a shudder, followed by a smile.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   "A shadow is gone from my soul. I feel reborn."
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   "If you mean you feel weak as a newborn Bern," Veridis muttered as he emptied his boot of water and tried to pull it back on, "then I feel the same."
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   "That is not what I mean," the giant rumbled, regarding Veridis with serious eyes.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   "You set Rayna and Tane free. You set me free. I owe you a debt beyond all imagining."
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   "You are in no debt to me," Veridis said.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   "I kicked the effigies into the fire on impulse, not really knowing what they were or what power they held over you."
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   "But you suspected."
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   "Aye. Something that Fidale said."
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   He thought of Nithair's mother, hoped that she had made it to freedom along with his brother, Krelis, Makin, and Albin.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   "And your wife and son. I set them free because it was the right thing to do. There was no other choice."
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   "Ah, but there was, True Heart. There always is."
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Veridis shrugged.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   "There is no debt between us. You are my friend."
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   "One of my only friends, it has turned out."
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   His thoughts swept bitterly to Nithair and the confession and revelations that had stunned Veridis.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   He remembered Callidus' confession, that Nithair had slain Aquilas, his own father.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Anger and shame twisted through him.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   There had been so many signs.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   "How can I have been deceived for so long? I am a fool."
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   "How long?" Veridis asked him.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   "How long have you been Callidus' prisoner?"
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Alcyon's smile withered.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   "Sixteen years."
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   "That is a long time."
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   "It is." Alcyon clenched his fists, knuckles cracking.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   "I should have killed him."
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   "To be fair, we both tried hard on that count.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   I put a knife in his belly, threw him in a fire, and he shattered his chest with a war hammer."
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   "Kadoshim are hard to kill."
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   "I'd have to agree."
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   "Can he be killed?"
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   "Maybe taking his head. That is how the others are slain."
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   "Others?"
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   "N'jihah. They are demon-possessed by Kadoshim. At Murias."
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Alcyon said to the question in Veridis' eyes.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   "The jihah," Veridis muttered, shaking his head, "have been so blind."
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   "You trusted your king and your friend," Alcyon shrugged.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   "There are worse failings to have."
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   "Are there?"
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   "I have dedicated my life to a lie."
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   They both sat in silence, water dripping from clothes and hair.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   "What now?" Veridis said to himself.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   "It feels as if my whole life has been dedicated to N'Thir and his cause."
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   "What do I do now?"
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Alcyon regarded him gravely, then poked his chest with a thick finger.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   "What does your heart tell you?"
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   "I would not trust it."
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   "Look what has led me thus far," Veridis said sourly.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   "Your eyes are open now."
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Veridis sucked in a deep breath, felt exhaustion seeping through him.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   "What would you do?" he asked the giant.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   "Find my kin. My Reinar and Tain."
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   He smiled as he said their names.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   "Kin?"
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   "My father is slain, as is my brother Ektor. Only Krelos is left."
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Suddenly he was desperate to see his older brother.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   "Find our kin," he echoed.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   "A good place to start."
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Something squawked, a handful of wood pigeons suddenly bursting from the trees and flapping noisily overhead.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   "We should move."
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   "We need cover."
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   "Aye, to the trees," Veridis said as he stood suppressing a groan.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   They were halfway across the clearing when Alcyon stopped abruptly, staring back along the riverbank.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Forms appeared around a distant bend on the track, shadows in the half-light that Form's canopy created.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Black shadows with curved swords sheathed across their backs.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   "Kadoshim," Alcyon growled.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Veridis counted at least seven of them, moving quickly, a loping, ground-eating pace like a pack of wolfen.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   They were spread in a half-circle between the riverbank and the treeline.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   "They are hunting us. Have been running all night long following the river in search of our trail."
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   One of the figures paused, the others rippling to a halt about it.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   It lifted its head, as if tasting the air, then gave an ululating howl and leapt forwards a new energy in its stride.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   "They've caught our scent."
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Veridis felt a jolt of fear.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   He'd faced giants, draigs, warbands, but somehow knowing that the demons of the Otherworld were hunting him sent a cold shock of fear tingling through his veins.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   "Kadoshim. Kalidus's kin. My enemy."
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Kalidus filled his mind, an image of the man he had thought counselor and ally emerging from the fire in Brickhand's tower, flame-wreathed and snarling.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   "He has corrupted Nefair and has deceived me for so long. He is the author of this evil."
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Fear morphed into a cold rage and he reached for his sword, lips twisting.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   "Move!" Altean grunted and broke into a run.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Veridis resisted for a moment, inexplicably wanting to stand and fight these creatures, but Altean dragged him along and, in a heartbeat, they were only a few strides from the treeline.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   He realized the giant had no weapon, no warhammer or battle axe strapped across his back, no sword or dagger at his hip.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   They crashed through the first layer of undergrowth and were immediately enveloped by a twilight world of shadow and thorn.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Altean forged ahead, grunting as branches snapped upon his rock-like torso, thorns whipping at Veridis, vines tangling about his boots.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   For what seemed a long time, Veridis only heard his own heart thumping, the rasp of his breath, the thud of Altean's feet. Then there were sounds behind him, faint at first, like the rustle of wind through foliage, but soon louder, keening cries were floating about him.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   They splashed through a stream, something sinuous slithered beneath Veridis' feet, making him stumble.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   "They are almost upon us," he gasped to Altean. "Better to turn and fight, hold a sword in my fist, than die running."
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   "I know," the giant said, turning, chest heaving.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Veridis drew his sword as they put their backs to a huge tree, the stream before them, and waited.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Forms flitted through the gloom, emerging from a curtain of shadows and thick foliage.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   One was a long way ahead of the others, clothed in the dark mail of the jihad, pale-skinned, dark veins making a tapestry of its flesh.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   It saw them and leapt the stream, arms reaching for Veridis, not even bothering to draw its sword.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   "Remember, you must take their heads," Altean grunted, as he pushed away from the tree, hurling himself into the oncoming Karashim with bone-crushing power.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   The two fell to the ground. Veridis hurtled forwards, sword raised, hacking two-handed at the Karashim's arm, its hand spinning away, blood-like oil pumping languidly from the stump.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Then the two forms were rolling together again.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Altean growled in pain. Then he was on his knees, arms wrapped about the Karashim's torso, pinning its arms at its side.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   The creature's head writhed, veins bulging as it strained to break free, Altean's face turning purple with the effort, his locked fingers slowly pulling apart.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   "What are you waiting for?" the giant rasped, and Veridis swung his sword, chopping into the creature's neck.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Dark blood spurted from the half-severed neck, the Karashim screeching with fury. Altean roared with the strain of holding the creature.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Veridis wrenched his sword free and swung again.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   The Karashim's head flew through the air, landing with a splash in the stream, its body slumped, legs drumming as Altean fell away and rolled clear.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   A black, icor-like mist flowed from the Karashim's neck, hissing and swirling, gathering above its body, forming a human shape with tattered wings of smoke spread about it and red eyes glowing like coals at its heart.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Veridis stared, frozen. It screamed savagely, then it was melting away, torn and dispersed by a slight breeze.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   "What the hell?" Veridis gasped. "Down!" Altean yelled, as he surged up from the ground, a fist slamming into the jaw of a leaping Karashim, hurling it spinning into the undergrowth.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Almost as soon as it hit the ground, it was back on its feet, twisting like a feral cat.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Veridis hefted his sword, spread his legs to meet the impact and then something crunched into his side, sending him flying through the air, another Karashim's arms locked around his waist.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   He caught a glimpse of Altean standing, Karashim swarming upon him, then Veridis was slamming into the ground.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Pain exploded in his shoulder and his sword skittered away. He rolled, punched at his attacker, for a moment staring into its black, soulless eyes.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Then they were sliding into the stream, the Karashim beneath him, his hands fastening about its neck, squeezing, seeking to crush the life from the black-eyed abomination.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   It bucked and kicked like a wild stallion, thrashing a tempest amidst the stream water, but Veridis would not let go.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   He felt its strength ebbing, some of its vitality fading, then hands gripped him from behind, dragging him backwards, his fingers slipping as he was hauled to the bank.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Another Karashim stood over him, drawing its sword from its back as the one from the stream splashed into view.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   He rolled and saw a handful of Karashim circling Altean, who had fallen to one knee, the giant bleeding from a dozen wounds.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Veridis tried to drag himself through the mud towards his friend. Another Karashim was held in Altean's arms, he had one hand gripping its jaw, the other wrapped about its chest.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   With a savage wrench, Altean heaved. Veridis heard the Karashim's neck break, then the sound of flesh tearing, Altean screaming his defiance as he ripped the Karashim's head from its shoulders.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   He flung the corpse to the ground as the black mist boiled from the dead creature's wound.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   A searing pain lanced through Veridis' leg, a Karashim blade scoring along his thigh.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   He dropped to the ground, looked back at the two Karashim on the stream bank. They were following him, toying with him.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   The one with the drawn sword slashed his blade across Veridis' upheld forearm, a new cut burning like fire.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   "Think we'll bleed you a while," the Karashim said, leering with pale lips. "Pay you back for the chase you've led us."
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   It should not end like this.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Frustration gave Veridis a last surge of strength and he rolled to his feet, pushed himself upright.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   The Karashim before him grinned, then paused, cocking its head to one side.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Figures burst out of the gloom. Veridis' hopes rose and then fell as he saw the newcomers were dressed in black breastplates with silver eagles on their chests.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Eagle Guard, no doubt sent by Nefair to make sure that his monsters complete their task.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Ten, twelve, fifteen more men, one of them tall and wide.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Veridis blinked. Something familiar.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   "Well met, little brother," the big man bellowed, grinning wildly.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   A moment's confusion followed swiftly by elation. "Krelis!"
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Then Krelis and his men were attacking the Karashim, Krelis taking a head in one great swing of his longsword.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Another warrior swept into view, this one not dressed as a man of Tenebraal but gripping a knife in each hand.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   He joined Krelis and together they attacked the Karashim before Veridis.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Makin and Krelis.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Chapter Two
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Nefair
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Nefair stood in the great hall of Drassil and stared at the giant's skeleton on its throne.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   The bones of the ribcage surrounded a thick-shafted spear, the wood dark and pale-veined,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   only a hint of black iron of the blade visible, the rest buried in the great tree of Drassil.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   "So that is Skald, High King of the Giants, and that is the Starstone Spear."
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   "Skald, the last man to rule a united empire where giants and men live together in peace."
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   "Will I be the next to unite this shattered world?"
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   The skeleton was mottled yellow and brown, ancient,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   the brow of the skull broad and thick eye sockets, black holes that seemed to stare at Nefair, questioning him.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   "Are you worthy?"
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   "Are you capable?"
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   He sighed.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   "History shall be my judge, nothing and no one else."
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   A hand touched his shoulder.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Sezus was standing at the head of three-score Eagle Guard.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   The young warrior had been recently promoted to High Captain of the Fares Warband now that Veridis was gone.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   "Ah, Veridis, are you dead or alive, old friend?"
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   "It does not seem right that you are not beside me to share in this great victory."
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   He had been informed of Veridis' betrayal, his attempt on Calidas' life, and he and Alteon's escape.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   "Veridis, how could you abandon me, break your oath to me?"
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   He looked at the white scars on the palm of his hand,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   one of them made as a blood oath of brotherhood to Veridis on a moonlit hillside and tenor brow.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   It felt like a lifetime ago, words and promises spoken by different people.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   "My king," Sezus said, "it is Calidas. He asks for you."
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Nefair looked back at the skeleton one last time, then turned and strode through the huge chamber.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   The dead were still being cleared from the battle of the day before.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Blood stained the stone floor, mounds of corpses lay in stinking piles.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Hundreds of them, Kadashim, Jiha, Vinthalan, Eagleguard, Bonothi giants, many others.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   The cost of taking Drassil had been high, higher than he would have imagined
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   considering that the element of surprise had been on their side.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   But victory is victory.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   The fortress is ours, the back of our enemy broken.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Though many had escaped, reports were coming in of pitched battles still being fought beyond the walls of Drassil.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Nefair glanced to his right as he passed an open trapdoor as wide as the gates of Jeralin
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   and the dark stain of blood on the stone before it.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Maikal's blood.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   The Ben Elim's head now adorned a spear set in the ground of the courtyard before the gates of Drassil.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   It was not alone.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   But what of Corbin, their bright star?
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Where is he?
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   He glared mistrustfully into the yawning dark of the tunnel,
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   knew that Maikal had chosen to stand and fight there to gain time for many who escaped into the tunnel.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Was Corbin one of them?
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   There had been no reports of Corbin being seen during the battle.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   Had he even been here?
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   It had been a long night and Nefair felt a greater weariness settling upon him than he had ever known before.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Saesir snapped an order behind him and eagle guards spread to either side forming a protective column.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Drassil is not yet secure, Saesir said in reply to Nefair's inquiring look.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   The courtyard also bore the signs of yesterday's battle.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Bodies scattered all about, flies buzzing, the metallic aroma of blood everywhere.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   For an instant, Nefair thought he saw a wolf and cub tugging at the leg of a dead Karashim,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   but looking back, realized it was a small white-furred dog.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   They turned a corner in a street and Nefair glimpsed the towering outer walls of Drassil
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   beyond the layers of stone buildings latticed with thick branches.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   This is a truly remarkable place.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Branches soared above him as thick as towers with buildings of stone and iron wrapped about them bound tighter than leather armor.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   It looks almost alive.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   The tree, the bones, the fortress, its flesh.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   The rasp of a sword drawn from its scabbard drew his attention
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   and he glimpsed the black-clothed warrior hurtling from the shadows of a doorway.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Abruptly, Saesir was yelling as more dark figures emerged, iron glinting.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   The eagle guard moved, shields thudding together around Nefair obscuring his view.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Blood sprayed, spattering Nefair's face as an eagle guard before him collapsed.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   A black-clothed jihad slipped into the gap carved in the shield wall, surging towards Nefair.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   Nefair drew his sword, fear and rage, his constant companions, igniting within him.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   The shouts and screams of battle faded, his world contracting to the jihad warrior before him.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   A woman, her dark-skinned face all sharp bones, almost fragile looking.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   "Truth and courage!" she yelled, curved sword rising.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   There was an explosion of sparks as their weapons met,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   the power of the jihad's strike making the tendons of his wrists shriek, shuddering on into his arm and shoulder.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   He pushed forwards, knowing to retreat was to die,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   tried to move within her guard, use his short sword where her longer blade would hinder her.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   They collided, limbs tangling as both crashed to the ground,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   wrestling, punching, kicking and biting at each other as they rolled back and forth across the stone street,
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   with a battle raging all about them.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   The jihad struck a glancing blow that made his vision blur.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   Then her knee crunched into his groin and he slumped, pain exploding,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   pulsing through him in savage waves, draining his strength.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   She pulled herself free and half rose as he coughed into the cold stone, tried to rise, knew if he didn't, he was dead.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   Fear and rage sparked inside him, sent new energy coursing through his veins.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   "I'll not die here."
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   The jihad stood over him, sword raised, her eyes bright with victory.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Then a form crashed into her, throwing her to the ground.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   She started to rise and a boot slammed into her jaw, sent her crashing back down.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   The figure was blurred, a buzzing cloud swirling about it.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Hands gripped him and pulled him upright, Sezus's concerned face appeared,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   blood sheeting from a long cut across his forehead.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Nathare looked past him, saw his rescuer pull a sword from a scabbard upon its back
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   and raise it over the unconscious jihad.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   "A Kadashim." "No," Nathare called.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   The figure's head turned to look at him, the buzzing cloud parting.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   "Flies," Nathare realized, recognizing the Kadashim.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   "No, Legion. I want her alive."
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   The Kadashim regarded him for a moment with cold black eyes.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   "Better dead," it said. "I want her alive," Nathare snapped.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   "Kalidas may have questions."
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   "Dead after, then," the Kadashim said, then sheathing its sword.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   "Kalidas wants you."
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   The flesh of its face and neck rippled, seeming to move of its own accord
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   as if something were locked within trying to get out.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   About them, the battle seemed almost done.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Nathare scanned the street, counted nearly a score of his eagle guard
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   dead to five or six of their jihad attackers.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   "This part of Drassil is supposed to have been cleared," he snarled.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   "How did they get in here?"
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   He looked down at the unconscious jihad's form at Legion's feet.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   "Bring her," Nathare said as he marched away.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   As Nathare entered the courtyard before Drassil's gates,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   he heard a rumbling growl reverberate from one of the many stables that edged the courtyard.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   He looked fondly at the doors that contained his draig.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   Kalidas stood before the closed gates of Drassil.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   To either side of him were a host of spears driven into the ground,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   most of them adorned with a head.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   A handful of Vinthalen warriors were planting new spears into the ground,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   while behind them, Kadashim prowled into the courtyard's shadows.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   Before Kalidas knelt a ragged group of people, bound at wrist and ankle,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   over three hundred prisoners from yesterday's battle.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Above them, eagle guards stood upon Drassil's walls.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   "My warriors."
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   They were easily the best-disciplined troops amongst those that had stormed Drassil.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   The Kadashim and many of Lycus's Vinthalen were involved in the pursuit of their scattered enemy out beyond Drassil's walls.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   But Nathare suspected that most by far were ranging throughout the forest, looting and drinking.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   The Kadashim were doing other things, such as eating their victims.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Lycus was standing behind Kalidas.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   A dozen Vinthalen ranged about him, hard-looking men, bodies lean and muscular, skin weathered and scarred.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Lycus lifted a waterskin to his mouth and took a long drink.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   "I'd wager it's not water that he's drinking."
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   The Vinthalen saw him approaching and nodded a greeting.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Nathare hid his disgust.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   "Him and my mother."
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   "Ah, Nathare," Kalidas said.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   He raised an eyebrow at the blood on Nathare's face, then saw a legion dragging the Jihar warrior across the courtyard by her ankle.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   "Kalidas?" Nathare said with a dip of his head.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   His old counselor was not looking his best.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Part of his face was burned charcoal black and peeling.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Silver hair was growing in tufts from patches on his head, elsewhere singed to stubble or burned clear.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   "It would appear that the streets of Drassil are not yet cleared of our enemy," Nathare said sourly,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   as legion dumped the Jihar warrior in front of Kalidas.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   She groaned, pushing herself to her knees as legion's hand clamped on her shoulder, holding her before Kalidas.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   "What is your name, child?" Kalidas asked, regarding her with his cold eyes.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   She spat blood at Kalidas's feet and glowered up at him.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   "Ilta," the Jihar said. "And I am no child."
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   "Well, Ilta, I shall ask you the same question that I have just put to your comrades."
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   "Where is Khoban?" "You will see him soon enough," a voice said from amongst the prisoners.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   "He will come for you."
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   "And when he does," said Ilta, as she turned her head to look from Kalidas to Nathare and Lycos, "he will kill you all."
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   "He is a boy. A puppet. Your ill master is already slain," Kalidas said angrily, sweeping a hand towards Michael's head.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   "You are wrong," Ilta said. "Khoban is our lord. He slew your best, Sumor, in single combat. We all saw it. He will do the same to you."
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   "Sumor," Kalidas frowned, "I saw his head decorating your gates."
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   "Khoban killed him," the prisoner's voice called out again, one vaguely familiar to Nathare.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   A figure straightened amongst the captives, black hair hanging lank about her face.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   "He took Sumor's head, and he will take yours too."
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   "Ah, Kohen."
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   "I want nothing more than for him to come and try," Kalidas said with a sigh, his expression mocking, but Nathare glimpsed something else in his eyes. "Doubt?"
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   "But so far, he does not seem inclined to do so," Kalidas continued. "Perhaps a message will speed him to us."
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   He looked to the Karashim. "Legion, choose one prisoner and impale them upon a spear," he ordered.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Legion drabbed Kohen and pulled her struggling towards a spear. "Not her," Kalidas said with a wave of his hand.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   Legion grabbed another prisoner. He was a man of Iseltir by the look of him.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   The Karashim hoisted him effortlessly into the air and brought him down slowly upon the upright spear.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Then the screaming began.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   When it was over, the prisoner was skewered like a squirrel ready for the cook fire.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   He was writhing upon the spear, blood pooling about his feet, screaming himself to oblivion.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Nathare resisted the urge to cover his ears. "On your feet," Kalidas said to Iltir.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   "Go and tell Korban what is happening to his followers, what I am doing.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   Tell him I will not stop until he has faced me."
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   Legion pushed her stumbling forwards as, with a rumble, the gates opened.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   She looked back once and then ran, the gates slamming behind her.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Kalidas barked in order and the remaining captives were led away.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   Kohen caught Nathare's eye as she walked in line, hatred pouring from her.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   "We must talk soon," Kalidas said to Nathare and Lycos.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   "High Sun and the Great Hall."
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Then he was striding away.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Lycos raised an eyebrow and offered Nathare his water skin.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Without thinking, Nathare took it and drank, then coughed, almost choking on the contents.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   "Is that..."
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   "Mead," Lycos finished for him.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   "Found a dozen wagons with barrels full of the stuff."
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Nathare handed it back to him and Lycos walked away, chuckling to himself, his Vinthalen following him.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Nathare headed for the wide stairs that scaled Drasil's walls and climbed to the top, stopping above the great gates where he stared out at the world beyond.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   A wide plain circled the fortress, clear blue sky bathing the ground in sunshine before the great trees of Faun blotted it from view.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   He caught a glimpse of Ilta just before she disappeared into the treeline.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Behind him, he heard the footsteps of Saesus and his eagle guard stopping a respectful distance away.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   The screams of the impaled in the courtyard were much fainter up here, fading to a pathetic mewling.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   He wished he would just die.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   "How have I allowed myself to come to this?"
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   "It is for the greater good. For me to win the war, Corban must die. To bring peace to the Banished Lands, Corban must die."
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   He felt his resolve stir, but still the screams wormed their way into his head, reminding him of other battles, other deaths in the name of this great cause.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   "And now I follow the path of Karoshim, of demons, of Asrath himself."
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   He remembered Kalidus' words to him in Murias, so persuasive.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   It had all been so logical when Kalidus explained it, made sense of the alliances, the lies.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   Deception upon deception heaped in a great pile.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   "But the truth is simpler," a voice seemed to whisper inside his mind.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Deep down, he knew.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   It was more basic when all was stripped away, Kalidus' persuasive arguments and philosophical debates on good and evil, right and wrong, the abstract meanings that were attached to names.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   Politics? Power struggles? Who deserved what?
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   The honest answer was much simpler than any of those meandering debates, and one that had been clearly reinforced by his brief struggle with the Jihar warrior before him.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   "I don't want to lose."
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   Chapter Three
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Corellon
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   Corellon sat with her back to a tree, staring into the dawn gloom of Faun, absently twirling a knife between her fingers.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Behind her were the sleeping forms of threescore or so of the survivors with whom she had fled Drassil.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   Amongst them was Brina, gray hair poking from beneath her cloak. Beside her the bolts of feral and laith curled close together.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   She glimpsed the Jihar, Akkar, standing guard on the far side of their camp.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   Exhaustion hovered at the fringes of her consciousness, and in so many ways it would be wonderful to lose herself in the nothingness of sleep.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   But she couldn't.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   Her mind was reeling. A whirlwind of grief, fear, and rage as fractured moments of the previous day played out in her mind's eye.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   Out of them all, though, everything kept returning to one thought circling.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   "Where is Corbin?"
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   The fog of tiredness crept upon her again. A relentless assault, but she knew that sleep would not come. The shock and horror of yesterday's battle was still too present.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   There was a soft footfall from behind, and a figure came to stand beside her.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Gar.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   The lord of the Jihar looked at her, lines of worry etched upon his usually unreadable face.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   He was clothed in a shirt of dark chainmail, splattered with grime and blood, his curved sword sheathed across his back, a single-bladed throwing axe hanging at his belt.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Even he was not free of injury. A bloodstained bandage was tied around his forehead.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   "Storm is with him," Gar said, as if he could read her thoughts. "They must be as plain to read upon my face as are his."
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Storm.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   That was a measure of comfort. Corolin knew that the wolfen was a better guardian than a dozen shieldmen, but still... "We will find him," Gar said.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   Corolin had seen the familiar scuff marks of Storm's claws in the tunnel, which was why they had exited at this spot.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   After a brief search, she'd found mawtracks, leading to the brow of the slope, but darkness had settled upon them, and no matter how frustrating, it was pointless to stumble around in the dark.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   But where can Corbin be?
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   He must have heard the din of battle from Drassil, even if he were this far away.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   The thoughts rose unbidden in her mind, the one thought she had refused to acknowledge throughout the long dark of night.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   What if he is slain?
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   What else could have kept him from returning to Drassil?
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   She felt a worm of fear wriggling through her belly but refused to consider it.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   "He lives. He must."
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   She nodded and stood, sheathing her knife, a myriad of cuts, bruises, and strains aching for attention.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   She ignored them all.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   "We need to go," she said.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   "Aye," Gar agreed.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   He continued to stare at the trapdoor.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   "I had hoped that Maekal would find us. That he escaped."
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Corolin remembered her last sight of the Benelim.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   Wielding his sword, two-handed, feet planted before the entrance to the tunnel in Drassil's great hall as they had retreated into its shadows.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   Swaths of blood had surrounded him as he swung his sword in deadly arcs, holding back the enemy, protecting them, purchasing them time to escape.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   "He would have come by now, if he could," Corolin said.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   Gar sighed and nodded.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   Corolin cocked her head, listening, staring down the hill.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   Something was moving in the undergrowth, heading towards the trapdoor.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   Gar saw it too, and without words the two of them separated, slipping into the shadows as they quietly surrounded the intruder.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   Bushes rustled, a twig snapped, and Corolin caught a glimpse of dark hair.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   She knew it wasn't Corbin. Even he isn't that clumsy.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   A figure burst from the undergrowth, a young man clad in leather and wool, his dark hair tousled, and a scabbing cut marking his forehead.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   He started at the sight of her, fumbled for a weapon at his belt, his eyes widening.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   "I know you," Corolin said, though she didn't remember his name.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   "Your da is Atilius."
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   A competent, unassuming warrior, Atilius had been a slave oarsman on a Vinthalan ship.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   The lad nodded, his lip trembling.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   "Pax? What are you doing here?" Gar said, stepping silently from the shadows, making the young warrior jump again.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   "You must come quickly," Pax blurted. "My da, Corbin, giants."
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   "Corbin?" Corolin hissed. "Aye, we must go."
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   Tears were spilling down Pax's cheeks now, tracing tracks through blood and grime.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   "He's dead."
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   Corolin froze, feeling as if a fist had just clamped around her heart.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   "I ran," Pax said.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   He began to shake, an involuntary twitching that quickly became more violent.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   "Where is Corbin?" Corolin asked, trying to control the panic leaking through her, reaching out to grab the now sobbing boy and shake the sense from him.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   "Hold," Gar said, putting a hand upon her arm. "Pax, you must tell us as clearly as you can. Where is Corbin and your da? What happened?"
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   Others were coming down the hill now, corralling glimpses of dath and color, a handful of Jeha laith looming behind them.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   "We heard fighting. Knew Corbin was out there," Pax began haltingly. "We found him, facing giants and bears."
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   "What? But there were no giants beneath there at Drassil."
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   "Da? He threw a spear at a giant. Then we all ran. We thought we'd lost them. Then..."
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   "Go on," Gar said. The whole group was gathered around them now, listening in absolute silence.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   "They came from nowhere, my da."
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   He rubbed his eyes, blew out a long breath.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   "They killed my da. Corbin told me to run, to fetch help."
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   "When did this happen?" Gar asked, not able to keep the urgency from his voice.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   "Yesterday, after Hai's son, before sunset."
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   Pax's face had grown paler as he spoke. Now he looked like a corpse.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   "I ran. I fell, hit my head."
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   He raised a hand to the cut on his brow.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   "When I came to? It was dark. I've been trying to find my way since then."
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   "Take us, now," Gar said.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   "I will try," Pax nodded. "I became lost for a while, but I know it was that direction."
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   Gar barked orders and then they were moving, Corolin taking the lead with Pax, Gar jogging beside the lad, a steadying hand on his arm.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   Corwin Storm, facing giants, alone. "Yesterday."
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   She sent a silent prayer to Elion, one of many that she had made over the last half day.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   "Let them still live."
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   Corolin was the first to enter the glade. At its far end was a sudden ridge, and beyond it, the sound of a fast-flowing river.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   The smell hit her first, the metallic tang of blood and decay.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   Death.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Flies were buzzing in great clouds about bodies heaped on the floor.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   She counted three giant corpses on the ground, and Atilius, pinned to a great oak by a giant's axe.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   She could not see Corbin or Storm.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   She ran to the first giant, who was on his back, a hole in his belly, throat cleanly cut, his wrist bearing the telltale, ripping wounds of the Wolfen.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   Corolin moved on, dimly aware of others spilling into the glade behind her, the sound of Pax's sobs as he dropped to his knees before his da, Gar's presence at her shoulder.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   The other two giants were close together, the ground trampled, rutted, dark and still sticky with blood.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   One's throat had been ripped out by Storm, the flesh mangled and torn.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   He is not here, nor Storm.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   The relief was a physical thing, though she knew their absence did not mean that they were safe or even alive, but it was clear they had fought here and won.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   They slew three giants.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   She felt a flush of pride at that feat, knew that it would be a story told around the campfire this very night, adding to the tales that were growing up around Corbin and his Wolfen companion.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   The other giant lay upon his front.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   Gar and Corolin tried to turn him over together, flies buzzed angrily, the huge warrior's dead weight like a boulder.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   Farrell and Laith joined them, and together they rolled the giant, the stench of corruption and decay wafting up to them as they disturbed the body.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   "He is of the Jotun clan," Laith spat as they stood and stared at the dead giant.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   "What are they doing here?"
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   Corolin's eyes were drawn to the glint of leather and iron amidst the congealed blood.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   She bent and wrapped a fist around the hilt of a sword buried deep in the giant's thigh, angled upwards into its groin.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   It came free with a sucking sound, and she lifted it for them all to see, the pommel shaped like a howling wolfen.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   The relief she'd felt fled, replaced by the crushing weight of fear.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   "That's Ban's sword," Dath said as he joined them, colour a pace behind him.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   Corolin stared at them a moment, felt a wave of sympathy for them.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   They'd been wed less than two nights.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   Gar took the sword from her and stared at it.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   I watched Ban's da give him this blade.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   "In the Rowan field at Duncarig," Farrell said. "I remember it."
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   "And I?" Dath muttered.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   Corolin turned away, her eyes scanning the ground, searching for any sign.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   "He is not here. Storm is not here."
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   "They escaped, but they did not make their way back to Drassil. Why?"
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   Briner was on her knees beside the giant.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   The old healer had a file in one hand, a knife in the other that she was using to scrape blood from the trampled grass.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   One side of Briner's face was still an angry red, seared by the explosion she had generated that had rocked the chamber in Drassil yesterday.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   Whatever benefit Briner thought the giant's blood would bring, she was welcome to it.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   As Corolin scanned the rest of the clearing, her eyes caught a patch of crushed grass spattered with blood.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   It was close to the edge of the glade, leading to a sheer drop to the river below.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   As if something were dragged.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   She followed the marks and dropped to a crouch, looking down to the river.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   Further down she spied a dark smear on a boulder. Blood.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   "They jumped into the river!" she called out.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   Gar was first to join her. His eyes found the same evidence, and he gripped her wrist.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   "After them," he said.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   Corolin led the way, running along the ridge that shadowed the river, twisting around thick-rooted trees in dense vegetation,
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   her eyes flitting between the path she was navigating and the banks of the river.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   Rounding a sharp bend in the path, she suddenly saw a shape lying on a grassy verge, firm-hatted and blood-stained.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   Her heart stopped.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   Storm.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   She skidded to a halt on the ridge above the wolfen, a part of her mind noticing large boot prints in the grass.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   In a spray of dirt, she scrambled over the edge, clinging to root and vine as she made her way down to the riverbank.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   Storm lay still as stone, and she was covered in blood a huge wound was visible above her shoulder.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   Corolin crouched, too scared to touch her, not wanting to confirm what her eyes were telling her.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   Stifling tears, she remembered the first time she had seen Storm when she had threatened to turn the wolfen into a cloak.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   Even then, she had seen the bond between Corbin and his faithful and vigilant shadow.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   Since then, she had developed her own bond with the wolfen, more like a sword brother to her than a mere animal.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   As Gar joined her, she tentatively reached out her hand and laid it upon Storm's body.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   She felt nothing. "No. Please, Elion above."
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   She screwed her eyes shut tight, pressed harder, flattening her palm against Storm's deep chest, willing her hand to feel the movement of life, a drawn breath, the pumping of Storm's heart.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   With every moment, her hopes faded, a bleakness taking hold inside, spreading through her like ink through water.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   And then, she felt it. A flicker, a heartbeat deep within the cavern of Storm's broad chest.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   Corolin opened her eyes and saw Storm's amber gaze regarding her.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   The wolfen whined, a weak, miserable sound, but one that gave Corolin a rush of joy.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   Storm's tail thumped feebly on the turf.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   Chapter 4 - Corbin
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   Corbin walked through a world of grey, dimly aware that he was staggering close to a wide and dark river.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   There was a splash and a wide ripple, the hint of something large and sinuous in its depths.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   Bloated dark clouds boiled above him, flickering with lightning, and black shapes winged through them with an occasional gleam of chainmail and iron.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   "This is the Otherworld."
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   His knee throbbed and a pain spasmed through his chest with every in-drawn breath.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   He fixed his eyes on the ground before him, concentrating on each step.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   There had always been an element of the Otherworld that calmed him, a serenity that settled within him that gave him a sense of strength and hope.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   But this time was different. There was something frayed about the peacefulness. It felt force.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   Something lurked at the fringes of his mind, trying, needing to be remembered.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   When next he looked up, the river was flowing into a valley, cliffs rearing up by the side of him tall and forbidding.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   Ahead of him, the river spilt into a lake. Vibrant colour was seeping into the landscape with every step into the valley.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   The grass grew greener, the river bluer, as if colour were seeping up from the rock below.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   "I know this place. I've been here before."
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   The green valley and the lake of deep blue. Gentle waves lapped against the shore.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   A sound drew Corbin's eye towards the lake's heart, a splash and ripples, as if a stone had been thrown into water.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   His memory prodded at him and his eyes wandered back to the lakeshore, searching for something else, and then he saw it.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   The red-leafed maple that he had once sat beneath.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   Without thinking, he made his way to it and sat down, his back to the trunk.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   Everything was still, no breeze to stir the grass or leaves, no hum of insects.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   The silence was oppressive.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   And then, high above, like a heartbeat, there was a beat of wings.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   He glanced up through the lattice of leaf and bark and saw a figure silhouetted against the clouds, human-like,
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   a spear clutched in one hand, broad, white-feathered wings powering it through the air.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   The Ben-elim. Maikal. Maikal.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   Then, like an avalanche, he remembered.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   Maikal, in the great hall of Drassil, telling Corwin about the deception of the Ben-elim,
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   how the prophecy was nothing more than a strategy, a trick to force Asroth's hand to lure Calidus and the Karashim to Drassil.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   That the bright star and black sun were an invention, fabricated to snare Asroth in the trap of his own making.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   A sound strategy, maybe, in the great war between Ben-elim and Karashim, the faithful and the fallen,
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   apart from the fact that it used people's lives like pawns on a throwboard.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   My Da's life. My Maam's. So many others.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   Rage swept through him, veined with betrayal at the memory of Maikal's confession.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   He remembered resisting the urge to strike Maikal, then leaving, knowing his rage was at the boundaries of his control,
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   and had ended up sitting upon a hill in the forest.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   He had sat there a long time, contemplating Maikal's words, trying to make some sense of what it would mean for the future.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   And then the Jotun giants had come.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   Ildir, their warlord, Slayer of Tuckle, Ghaz'dah.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   Images flickered through his mind, a bear roaring, spittles spraying from its red maw,
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   running, foliage whipping his face, the thunder of the bear's pursuit, the wounds to his knee and chest,
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   a spear piercing Storm, a river, ice-cold water.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   Storm howling as giants had dragged him away from her side.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   Storm.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   Pain shuddered through Corbin's chest as if someone were gripping his heart, squeezing and twisting it.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   He couldn't breathe.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   His sorrow was a physical thing that crushed the air from his lungs.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   He staggered towards the lake, dropping to his knees at the water's edge.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   Even as he did so, more memories flooded his mind, an unstoppable wave of drasil,
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   the frantic blowing of horns and sound of battle that had drifted up to him.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   Images of his loved ones swam before his eyes.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   Corolin, Ghah, Coen, Daph and Feral, Brynna, so many others.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   Do they still live?
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   Who was attacking drasil?
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   Dimly he became aware of movement.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   Before him, the water of the lake started to shift and foam, something rising from the depths.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   A shape appeared, water cascading and masking for a moment the creature within.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   Then a man was striding from the lake, with water dripping from the dark cloak that trailed him like seaweed.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   He approached Corbin.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   An interested, amicable smile upon his face.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   His skin was grey-mottled and veined like a dead thing.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   His hair was black and slick as oil.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   A black, scabbarded sword hung at his hip.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   "Well," the man said, "it's not often that I get visitors."
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   His voice was liquid, flowing like a shallow stream over shingle.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   "What brings you to my home?"
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   "I... I've been here before," Corbin said.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   "I know. I've watched you."
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   "This is the other world," Corbin said. "It is. And this lake, this tree, this valley,"
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   the dark-haired man said with a wave of his hands, "are mine."
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   He shrugged. Water dripped from his hair.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   "Are you... Ben Ellum?" Corbin asked.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   The man laughed, a damp exhalation.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   "Those pompous fools. No, though to my shame we are related."
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   "Caris him?" Corbin asked, fearful.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   "Hardly." The man snorted.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   "Those fawning debauched deviants. Do I look like one of them?"
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   "No," Corbin admitted. "Well, then, I am just me. Vaiarthen."
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   He lifted his hands, held one up to the sky, splayed his fingers.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   Corbin saw that they were webbed like a frog's feet.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   "You are from the world of flesh, are you not?" the man said.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   Corbin nodded wearily. "And what is your name, creature of flesh?"
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   Vaiarthen asked him, leaning in uncomfortably close,
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   his breath washing over Corbin moist and full of rot.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   Corbin did not want to tell him.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   "I'm... going to go now," he said, standing, wanting to be far away from this creature.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   "I don't think so," Vaiarthen sighed.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   "I think we should continue this conversation somewhere a little more... private."
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   Corbin backed away, turning to leave. Something grabbed his ankle.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   Looking down, he saw that it was a tendril of Vaiarthen's cloak, flexing like a grasping limb.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   It wrapped itself around his leg as Vaiarthen walked back towards the lake.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   Then, with shocking strength, the cloak pulled tight and started dragging Corbin.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   "For a moment," Corbin was too shocked to resist,
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   but then he scrambled back, yanking at his ankle, hand grasping for his sword.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   "Come on, don't dally," Vaiarthen called over his shoulder as he reached the lake.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   He walked in, sinking rapidly.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   The cloak seemed to split, to flow, forming a myriad of strands, reaching up to Corbin,
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   each one contracting around his ankles, wrists, and throat.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   Then he was being pulled down to the lakeshore, trussed like a fly in a spider's web, into the water.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   Panic filled him as his head sank beneath the surface,
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   and he struggled desperately, straining, veins bulging, muscles screaming.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   With a sinew-tearing effort, he pulled one arm free and then he was bursting out of the water,
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   hoisted into the air, dangling before the creature,
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   held up by his dark cloak that looked now more like a squirming nest of snakes.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   Corbin gasped for breath, ripping at the cloak strands, enclosing him to little effect.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   Vaiarthen regarded him with a cold fascination.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   "Tell me your name," Vaiarthen said, anger swelling in his voice the crash of waves upon rocks.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   "Let me go," Corbin grunted through his constricted chest.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   "You have trespassed here, disturbed my rest," Vaiarthen said wetly as he pulled Corbin closer.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   "In return, I will have some answers, and then, after, I may see how you taste."
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   A wave of found breath engulfed Corbin, making his stomach lurch.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   "What are you?" Corbin coughed. "I am Vaiarthen," the creature said,
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   his mouth opening wide, seeming to grow before Corbin's eyes, wider and wider,
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth glistening and dripping with mucus.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   "Eater of Souls."
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   There was a whistling sound, and a spear slammed into Vaiarthen's cloak, piercing it.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   Vaiarthen screamed as Ben-Elim swept down from the sky.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   More spears flew, stabbing into Vaiarthen's body.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   His yell deepened into a bellow of pain and rage,
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   and Corbin found himself thrown to the ground as the creature turned its attention to its attackers.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   Then hands were grasping Corbin, and he was hoisted into the air again.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   There was a Ben-Elim either side of him, surging skywards, their wings beating hard.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   Within heartbeats, the conflict in the lake was below them,
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   Vaiarthen and his living cloak sinking into the water,
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   one strand coiling around a Ben-Elim, dragging it beneath the surface.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   The Ben-Elim's scream cut short as the water closed over its head.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   They flew higher, following the course of a winding valley,
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   twisting and turning amongst peaks and sheer cliffs,
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   until Corbin saw a fortress appear in the crags,
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   a series of towers and battlements.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   Carved from bone-white stone, it seemed to glow,
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   even under the dark clouds that pressed down from above.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   The silhouettes of Ben-Elim filled the air about its towers,
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   some spiraling amidst the clouds, others hovering sentinels with long spears and glistening mail.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   He saw that many more patrolled the long, winding walls,
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   and the sounds of combat drifted up to him from the huge courtyards between the high towers.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   "They are sparring, as we were in Drassil. They are preparing for war."
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   His rescuers alighted upon the flat roof of a tower
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   and half-dragged Corbin through an archway, down a flight of stairs,
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   marching him into a huge, high-ceilinged chamber.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   Within it, thousands of Ben-Elim stood, all gleaming mail and white feathers,
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   a dense crown which parted before Corbin and his guards in an elegant ripple of feather and mail,
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   their pale, emotionless faces staring at him.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   In front of him was a raised dais, wide steps leading up to it,
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   and upon it, a great white throne, pale as bone,
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   a splayed-back fashion to look like feathered wings that rose and curled about the figure slumped within it.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   Its white, feathered wings were wrapped around the figure like a great cloak, feather tips draping the floor.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   The figure's head was bowed, dark hair hanging, concealing its face.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   As Corbin was marched closer, the figure raised its head,
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   its hair parting to reveal a familiar face that stared back at him.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   "Mycal."
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   Emotions ignited within Corbin warring with one another.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   Relief at seeing the face of a comrade, a friend in this strange place,
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   but alongside that the still raw wound of Mycal's betrayal.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   Corbin felt his cheeks flush with anger even as Mycal sat straighter,
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   his face racked with grief and pain,
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   an expression that was so out of place on the face of creatures normally marble-carved and expressionless.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   "What is wrong with him?"
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   Mycal drew in a shuddering breath.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   "Thank Elion," Mycal said.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   "You still live in your world of flesh.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.000]   If your spirit is here, then your body has survived."
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   Mycal seemed to struggle with his speech,
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   as if each word took an effort of pain and will.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   "Otherwise, your spirit would have crossed the bridge of swords."
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   Corbin blinked.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   Mycal reached out, beckoning Corbin to come closer.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   Corbin flinched away.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   "Don't touch me!" Corbin snapped, remembering the great hall in Drassil.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   The great lie.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   Corbin heard a hiss of outrage ripple through the room behind him.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   Mycal held a hand up.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   "Peace?" Mycal said.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   "But," one of the Ben Elim spluttered,
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   "this creature of flesh, he gives insult to you, our High Captain, second only to the Allfather."
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   "He has a good cause," Mycal said, lowering his head.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   He leaned back in his chair and gestured for Corbin to stand.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   Corbin saw that Mycal was paler than he'd ever seen him.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   Around his neck was a red wound, raw and angry.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   It was leaking some clear, icor-like substance.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   "What happened to you?" Corbin said.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   "Sometimes, if the wound is bad in the world of flesh, we bring a shadow of it with us back to the Otherworld."
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   Corbin's hand went to his chest, the dull ache he felt with every breath,
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   and understood that it was an echo of his broken ribs.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   "So, what is that a shadow of?" Corbin said, pointing to Mycal's wound.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   "I was beheaded in Drassil," Mycal said.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   "What?" The horn blasts, the sounds of battle that I heard.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   A seed of dread unfurled deep in Corbin's gut.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   "Calidus, Nathan, they attacked. How?"
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   "The tunnels," Mycal said wearily.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   "What are my friends and kin, my people?"
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   "Some escaped," Mycal breathed.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   "Gar led a retreat down the north tunnel. I held the Kadashim as long as I could."
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   He shook his head.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   "Drassil is taken."
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   The fortress, fallen. Taken by Nathan and Calidus.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   The implications hit Corbin like a stone fist, my warband defeated.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   Those that followed me trusted me. Dead. My friends.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   "See what your scheming has achieved," he snarled and launched himself at Mycal.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   His attack was so unexpected and so fast that he had his fingers clamped about Mycal's throat before anyone could move.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   Then there was an explosion of activity behind him, shouting, hands grasping him, wings flexing, beating.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   Blows rained upon Corbin, but he shrugged them off, continued squeezing.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   Mycal did not fight back, just sat within the great wings of his throne and stared into Corbin's eyes as he cried tears of grief and rage.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   "You have murdered my friends!" he yelled, a red rage swallowing him, replacing his despair.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   Something crunched into his head and the world disappeared for a moment in a white explosion.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   He felt his fingers slipping from Mycal, tried to hold on, but then more hands were gripping him, dragging him back, pressing him onto his knees.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   He looked up to see weapons raised over him and angry faces encircling him.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   A spear was speeding towards his heart.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   "No!" Mycal said, and the spear froze, a hand span from Corbin's chest.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   Angry voices called out. Corbin heard words like punishment and sacrilege.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   "No!" Mycal repeated, and the crowd parted before Corbin to reveal Mycal still sitting upon the throne.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   He regarded Corbin with his emotionless face back in place, though Corbin thought he saw cracks within it.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   "He has cause to be angry with me. Angry!" Corbin shook his head.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   "You lied to me. To all of us in Drasil. Used us as bait. As pawns."
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   "All of you," he added, glaring at the Ben Elim gathered around him.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   Most of them were glaring back at him.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000]   "And now? It seems that your plan has worked a little too well.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   You certainly brought Callidus running to Drasil. Tell me, Mycal, was it also part of your plan for Drasil to fall?
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   For my friends? My kin? My people? To be slaughtered?"
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   He ground his teeth, swallowed.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   "Or for you to be beheaded?"
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   "No. It was not," Mycal said with a slow sigh.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   The war is lost before it even began.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   The Banished Lands conquered, all those whom I love slain or scattered.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   Despair rose up in him then, draining all energy from his limbs.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   He slumped in his captor's grip.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   "It is not over," Mycal said.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   It took a few moments for his words to seep through the fog of misery and hopelessness that engulfed Corbin.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   "Of course it is," Corbin whispered.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   "No. Not while you live. Not while Callidus still seeks the Seven Treasures.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   He needs them all to fulfill his plan and until then, Asroth is bound here in the Otherworld."
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:14.000]   "There is no way back from this. We don't know that," Mycal said.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   "Gah led many from Drassil. They may still live. There are those who would still stand against Nathare and Callidus.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   There is still hope."
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000]   Corbin's head snapped up, locking eyes with Mycal.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   "Do not speak to me of hope. You who have fed me lies all my life.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   You are no better than Asroth and his cadishim, a liar, a deceiver, and I wish I'd never met you."
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   Angry words rippled around the chamber.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   Mycal's gaze hardened.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   "I have allowed you the courtesy of expressing your anger, but do not go too far.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   There is more at stake here than your hurt feelings. You are behaving like an angry child."
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   He paused, visibly sagged in his chair, lost a hand over his eyes.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   "Your whole world lies in the balance. It is not over yet. There is still hope, a fighter's chance."
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   "There is no chance, nothing that I can do. Back in the Banished Lands, I am a captive of the Joltun, wounded, my bones broken, and Storm is dead."
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:46.000]   His voice choked in his throat, a fresh wave of emotion swelling in his chest.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   Mycal lowered his head.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:58.000]   "Another grievous blow," he muttered. "Storm was a better guardian than a score of shieldmen."
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   "She was more than my guardian," Corbin snarled. "She was my companion. My friend."
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   He rubbed his eyes, angrily brushed away his tears.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   "Your lies? Of course the death of my kin, my da, my ma'am, my friend, and so many others.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   All of them dying for a hope that never existed. All of them dying for me.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   And because you underestimated Calidas, you have left us with no chance.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   While there is breath in your body, there is a chance," Mycal shouted, leaning forwards in his chair, hands gripping the armrests.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   For a moment, his cold face melted away.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   "And if there is no chance of victory, then what of vengeance?
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   Do more than talk and whine. Seek your vengeance for those fallen.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   Or would you rather wallow in self-pity than try to save your loved ones?"
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   He sagged, the effort clearly draining him.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   "I will not be told what to do by him. I will be controlled and manipulated by him no longer."
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   Nevertheless, Mycal's words affected him.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   Images of Gar and Cuen, Corellon, Faryll and Daph, Brynna, Edana.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.000]   So many others that he had met during the long, hard journey from his home in Dunkarrig to Drassil.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   And the thought of them without him, perhaps fighting, maybe dying.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   For a moment, all he wanted was to get back to them, to be at their side.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000]   "I will not abandon them to death or torment, let them face the end alone.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   I must go back if there is a chance to help them."
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   He looked up at Mycal, felt his fists clenching.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   "I will go back, but not for you. Not for any of you.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   I am your puppet no longer. I go to help those that I love."
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   Mycal stared at him for long, silent moments, then nodded his head.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   "I will help you all that I can, though I am bound to the other world now.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   I cannot return to the Banished Lands. I don't want your help." Corbin growled.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   Mycal finally nodded.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   "Good," he whispered.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   He approached Corbin and placed a palm over his eyes, whispering words that Corbin could not hear.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   He opened his mouth to say something, but then the world seemed to fade about him.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.000]   Chapter 5 - Rafe
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.000]   Rafe felt something wet and rough scratching across his cheek.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000]   He wanted to move, but found he lacked the ability.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000]   Even opening his eyes was too much of an effort.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.000]   So he just lay there, allowing his other senses to wash over him.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000]   He ached. His muscles, joints, his very bones seemed to throb.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   But even as he became aware of the sensation, it began to fade, transforming into something else.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   A sense of relaxed exhaustion, like lying in a hot bath after a long hunt.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   He could hear birdsong, the ripple of river water and the hulls of moored boats nudging into one another.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   Beyond that, the drum of hooves, many feet. Voices.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:48.000]   He did not know how long he lay on the ground like that, but at some point the rough wet scratching on his face came back.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000]   A dog's tongue licking him.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000]   A smile cracked his lips and he opened his eyes.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   An explosion of light burst upon him, feeling as if rays of the sun had pierced his skull, lancing through his head.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   He screwed his eyes shut. The pain dimmed.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000]   He tried again, slowly this time.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.000]   He saw a black nose, snuffling, fur tickling his chin.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   "Hello, sniffer," he croaked.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   His voice roared and cracked.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000]   Ignoring the pain, he pulled himself to his knees, then to his feet.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   He staggered and braced himself against the wide trunk of a tree.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   "What has happened to me?"
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   He stretched, the stiffness in his body melting away.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:43.000]   For a while he stood there, feeling his muscles uncoiling, enjoying the sense of energy, of strength and vitality that flowed through him.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   "I feel good," he muttered, smiling and reaching to Pat Sniffer's head.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   He saw Scratcher standing further away, eyeing him suspiciously.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.000]   "It's all right," he said, beckoning the hound.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   "Nothing to fear."
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:08.000]   The hound came to him, ears still flattened, tail tucked low, and he laughed, ruffling the hound's fur.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   "I'm starving."
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   Memories filtered back.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   Of the battle in the swamp against Idana's warband.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000]   His desperate escape.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:23.000]   Of walking away from Morcan's tower after his interrogation by Rin and her giant Uthas.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   Then walking along the riverbank, finding a solitary spot beside a tree to drink a skin of wine and eat some cold lamb.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:37.000]   He'd scratched at his chin, felt a thick layer of stubble, which felt strange.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   "How long have I been here?"
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   He looked around at the marshland trees and bushes, the birds nesting amongst them, blue and orange butterflies flitting, then up at the sky, which was a clear blue, the spring sun warm upon his face.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:59.000]   Somehow everything felt sharper, brighter and clearer.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000]   "I feel reborn."
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.000]   He looked down and noticed the shoulder of lamb he'd brought with him from the camp.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   The hounds had stripped it clean and cracked the bones.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:14.000]   Beside it were the broken shards of the box he'd found in the bog near Dun Terrace.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:20.000]   And next to that was a cup, dark metal, runes carved into its rim.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000]   A dribble of wine ran from it.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.000]   And he remembered, like a punch in the gut.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000]   "I drank from it."
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:38.000]   His legs felt weak and he leaned against the tree as he felt for a moment an echo of the pleasure and pain that had wracked his body after drinking from the cup.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000]   He felt scared.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000]   "What have I done?"
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000]   "It is an enchanted cup. It has some kind of spell upon it."
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:51.000]   "But I'm not dead. If anything I feel more alive than ever before."
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:57.000]   He took a tentative step away from the tree, reaching down to pick up the bag that contained his kit.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   For a few heartbeats he stood and stared at the cup, then quickly bent and grabbed it, stuffing it into his bag.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:12.000]   He picked his way along a twisting trail amongst the tall grass banks of reed, eventually coming across a stream that led him back to the river.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:20.000]   The river was full of moored boats. The strong smells of newly cut pine, sap and fresh-soaked pitch filled the air.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:30.000]   Frames of scaffolding timbers that held half-constructed boats lined the riverbank, skeletal hulls like the bones of flesh-picked whales.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000]   Teams of men were working on them.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:43.000]   Rafe walked past unnoticed, moving out onto the rolling meadows that spread beyond the marshlands and ended in the north at the fringes of the Baglan forest.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:51.000]   He stopped here, staring, surprised at the difference in what felt like only a half-day, but had clearly been longer.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.000]   Immediately before him was Morcant's tower.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:02.000]   Wains pulled by shaggy-coated auroch filed in and out of the tower gates.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:09.000]   On the meadow about it, the tents of Wryn's warband of black and gold had multiplied.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:18.000]   To the west, Rafe saw horsemen riding at straw targets, other men on foot sparring with practice swords and spears.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000]   They are readying for another stab at Idana, then.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000]   Rafe.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:37.000]   Morcant was striding towards him, looking striking in his black cuirass and sabled cloak edged in gold trim, hair pulled back, warrior braid freshly bound with gold wire.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000]   Two guards walked at his back.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   He looked far better than the last time I saw him, in Ryn's tent, fresh from the battle, covered in marsh, slime, and blood and stinking like a stagnant pool.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000]   "Where have you been, boy?" Morcant snapped at him.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:02.000]   "I, uh, over there, sleeping," Rafe said, pointing vaguely at the river and marshes.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.000]   "Sleeping?" Morcant snorted. "For a ten night."
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   "A ten night? I thought you deserted. Didn't think you had the stomach for any more battle."
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:20.000]   "I have so," Rafe said, bridling at Morcant's veiled insult.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:30.000]   "Watch yourself," Morcant scowled. "I'm Lord of Arden now. I could put your head on a spike with a snap of my fingers."
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:38.000]   Rafe felt a blossoming of anger, hotter and faster than he was used to. With an effort, he suppressed it.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:49.000]   "I thought Evniss was Lord of Arden." "Evniss has not returned. Is believed dead," Morcant said disdainfully.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:56.000]   "Ryn has appointed me to rule in his absence." "Dead?"
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:07.000]   In truth, Rafe had lost sight of Evniss when the rebels' fire had started sinking their boats and Rafe had become too preoccupied with his own survival to worry about anyone else.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:18.000]   But he would grieve for Evniss if he was dead. He had been his lord for as long as he could remember. His dar had served Evniss as huntsman for many years.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:29.000]   "So," Morcant told him arrogantly, "I am your lord now and you shall remember it. Now come with me. Queen Ryn wishes to speak with you."
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   He followed Morcant around the rim of the hill, skirting the palisaded wall as they made their way through lines of tents to a central larger one.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   Towering like statues, two giants stood outside alongside a handful of Ryn's shieldmen.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:51.000]   Rafe gazed at them as he waited to be announced. The giant nearest to him was a female.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   She stood with folded arms, returning his stare, two knife-hilts as long as short swords crisscrossing her back.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000]   Her brow furrowed as she regarded him.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:10.000]   "Queen Ryn, we'll see you now," a shieldman told them, and Rafe stepped out of the sunshine into the cool shadow of the tent.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:19.000]   Ryn was sat at a broad table, her silver hair braided with golden wire, a bearskin cloak pulled high about her neck.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000]   A huge parchment was unrolled on the table.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:30.000]   Rafe glanced at it and saw it was a map of the marshlands, their position at Morcant's tower marked upon it.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:37.000]   The marshes were largely a blank, with a circle roughly marking the position of Duncryn.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:47.000]   Behind Ryn stood Uthas of the Bonoffee, gripping a thick-shafted spear, and about his neck hung a necklace made from long, curved fangs.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:58.000]   "Ah, the wanderer returns," Ryn cried when she saw him. "I thought you dead. Or captured," she added, her eyes narrowing.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.000]   "Can I trust you now? Where have you been?"
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.000]   "Sleeping," Morcant said before Rafe could reply.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000]   "Who with?" Ryn asked.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:15.000]   "No one. Myself," Rafe stuttered. "My dogs."
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   Ryn raised an eyebrow.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:26.000]   "No need to be shy. Everyone needs some time to relax and indulge in their personal pleasures. That's what is life for.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:34.000]   But sleeping for a ten night, a little extreme, don't you think? And a little unbelievable—are you lying to me?"
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   "No, my queen," Rafe mumbled. "I drank something."
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.000]   Morcant's snorted laughter.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:47.000]   Ryn paused and stared at Rafe, head cocking to one side.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.000]   "Are you well? You seem... different."
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:58.000]   Rafe returned her gaze steadily, his eyes drawn to the details of her face.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:05.000]   The wrinkles creased around her mouth, tracing her tapestry upwards across the arch of her cheeks to cluster around her eyes.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000]   Her skin appeared so fine, almost translucent.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:18.000]   His gaze was drawn deeper, the pulse of myriad veins beneath her diaphanous skin a steady and hypnotic beat.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:25.000]   His gaze drifted higher, to her eyes, which were a deep dark blue like still waters.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000]   They transfixed him.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:34.000]   "Answer your queen," Morcant snapped, raising his hand to cuff Rafe across the back of her head.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:44.000]   Rafe saw it all as if in slow motion, and before he'd even realized what he was doing, his hand shot up, grabbing Morcant's wrist and stopping it dead in its tracks.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:53.000]   There was a moment of shocked silence, everyone staring at Rafe as Morcant tugged on his arm, unable to break Rafe's grip.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:24:04.000]   "How dare you!" Morcant snarled, as he struggled to free himself before reaching for the knife at his belt. "I'll carve off your bloody fingers one by one!"
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000]   "Enough!" Rin said.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:16.000]   Morcant froze, and with a conscious effort, Rafe suppressed the bubbling anger within him and released Morcant's wrist.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000]   Red marks were already purpling into bruises.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000]   "I don't like being struck," Rafe muttered.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:29.000]   "So we can see," Rin said with a calculating smile.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:36.000]   Morcant scowled at him as Uthas leaned forwards, gray bushy eyebrows bunching together in a frown.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.000]   "Morcant is Lord of Arden, then."
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000]   "What have I done?"
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:53.000]   "I... I am... sorry," he said quietly, then rubbed his eyes. "I do not know why I did that, or what's happening to me."
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:58.000]   Rin exchanged a quick, unfathomable look with Uthas before turning back.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.000]   "I have need of you, so I shall forgive you. This once."
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000]   "Thank you, my lady."
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:12.000]   Rafe had the sense to dip his head as he spoke, avoiding the urge to glance at Morcant and smirk.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:19.000]   "And I am sorry, my queen," he added for good measure.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000]   Rin waved a hand.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.000]   "Sorry is not good enough," she said, a tone entering her voice that scared Rafe.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:34.000]   "I am your queen, and you are my subject. Learn your place."
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000]   "I will," Rafe muttered.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:48.000]   "See that you do," Rin said. "And also make sure that the next time I send for you, you come. Your life is mine."
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.000]   She stared at him, no hint of expression on her face.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:58.000]   "I can make it a good life, or an unpleasantly short one."
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000]   Rafe gulped. "Do we understand one another?"
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000]   "Aye, my queen," Rafe nodded.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:18.000]   "Good. Now come over here and help me with this map. I aim to have Adana's head on a platter within a ten night."
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:30.000]   Kamlin padded along the stream's edge. His bow held loosely in one hand.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:35.000]   He was returning to Duncrin from a hunting trip. Hunting men.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:42.000]   It had been a ten night since the Battle of Duncrin, where Evniss and Morkan's warband had been largely scattered.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000]   He and a score of others had set about hunting down the stragglers.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.000]   "The more we kill now, the fewer will come back to try and kill us later."
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:57.000]   Kamlin had split his hunting party into pairs, although he himself had ended up in a group of three.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:03.000]   He glanced down at Meg, the bairn who he'd rescued from a village on the outskirts of the marshlands.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.000]   "Though she's more than paid me back. The time she saved my hide now."
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:15.000]   She was walking alongside him, wearing a warrior's leather jerkin, holding a spear in one hand,
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:22.000]   her other resting upon the pommel of a new dagger that was hanging at her belt, all of them spoils taken from the Battle of Duncrin.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:31.000]   Kamlin had helped her cut down and restitch the jerkin, as well as chopping an arm's length of the spear to make it more manageable for her.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:37.000]   Part of him had been concerned about her accompanying them. She seemed worse, though.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:42.000]   A memory of the mottled feet of a bairn swinging from gallows insinuated its way into his mind.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:48.000]   Beneath it, bloated corpses littering a courtyard. Much worse.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:54.000]   A shadow crossed his path, and he looked up to see the third member of his party flying above him.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.000]   Kraff swooped down and squawked loudly.
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.000]   "Dark waters? Tall towers?"
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:09.000]   "I know," Kamlin muttered. "Don't need a bird to tell me when I'm close to home."
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000]   Nevertheless, he raised a hand at Kraff.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:21.000]   When I first met that bird, I must confess I didn't like him much. Turns out he's right-handed to have about, though.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.000]   Kraff had led him straight to over a dozen enemy warriors lost in the marshes.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:32.000]   Kamlin had made sure they stayed lost, left them lying face-down in the mud.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:37.000]   He walked through a last bank of reeds and came out on the shore of a huge lake.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:46.000]   The towers and walls of Dunkerin reared out of the lake's waters, damp and moss-covered like some frozen leviathan.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.000]   Figures moved on the battlement walls, boats scudding between towers.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.000]   All about him on the lakeshore there was motion.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:01.000]   The wives and bairns of the warriors who had fought in the Battle of Dunkerin had finally returned from their hiding place deeper in the marshes,
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:10.000]   and all manner of rough shelters were being erected, mostly consisting of linen tents and paneled walls of woven willow.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.000]   Best not make themselves too comfortable.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000]   Meg dashed off and merged into the crowds.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:25.000]   Kamlin watched as a pair of children rummaged amongst the piles of war gear that had been stripped from the dead and heaped in mounds along the lakeshore.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:37.000]   Great stacks of swords and spears, shields, boots, belts, knives, quivers, shirts of mail, cuirasses of boiled leather and cloaks of black and gold.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:44.000]   Meg reappeared at his side, now with an iron helmet much too big for her head added to her outfit.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000]   Kamlin tried not to laugh, but wasn't wholly successful.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000]   "What?" Meg scowled at him.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.000]   "Think that helmet might slow you down?" he said.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:00.000]   "Besides, your head's thick and off. Doubt if you'll need it."
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000]   She punched him in the leg.
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000]   "When are we leaving?" she asked.
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000]   "Don't know." He shrugged.
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.000]   "Probably talk about it a while before we get around to doing it."
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000]   He paused as the crowds opened up before him.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:27.000]   Yedana was walking calmly through their midst, stopping now and again to address someone directly, holding her hand here, cupping her cheek there, always seeming to be interested in what was being said to her.
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:33.000]   Baird, the one-eyed warrior of Doan, and Von, accompanied her.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:41.000]   Kamlin frowned as he watched the young warrior, his eyes shadowed with dark circles, grief carving new lines upon his face.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:49.000]   "Oh, I guess I'm partly to blame for that. Me having killed his da might have something to do with his current mood."
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:56.000]   He'd tracked Von after the battle, found him leagues from anywhere, alone apart from his da, Evanus.
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000]   Kamlin had watched as they'd argued.
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:04.000]   It had ended with Von turning his back on Evanus and walking away.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:10.000]   Evanus had followed, hand dipping inside his cloak and coming out with a knife in his fist.
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000]   Kamlin had put two arrows through the man's chest.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.000]   His eyes flickered back to Yedana.
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:23.000]   "She has grown since that night in Dunkaric when she saw her da murdered.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:28.000]   Even fought Roshin of Doan in the Court of Swords and Won.
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000]   Mind, exile was too good for a woman like that.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000]   She'll never stop her troublemaking."
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:40.000]   He searched behind Yedana, looking for his friend, Halion.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000]   "He should be back by now."
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:49.000]   Then he saw him sitting beside a fire with Lorkhan, Halion's half-brother, Roshin's son, heir to the throne of Doan,
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:56.000]   and unofficially betrothed to Yedana with his shieldman, Brogan Nonak as Meg affectionately referred to him.
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:03.000]   "Good to see you," Halion said, rising and gripping Kamlin's forearm.
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:07.000]   "You too," Kamlin said with a grin.
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:13.000]   Kamlin looked at their faces, saw they were all somber, attention in the air.
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000]   Lorkhan's dark eyes were red, looked as if he'd been weeping.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000]   "Am I interrupting?" Kamlin asked.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.000]   "Just tell me to bugger off, if I am."
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:28.000]   "No, Kamlin," Lorkhan said, standing and surreptitiously wiping his eyes.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000]   "I was just going."
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:36.000]   He bade them farewell, Halion squeezing his shoulder and left.
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000]   Brogan followed faithfully in his wake.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000]   "You all right?" Kamlin asked.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.000]   "No," Halion said honestly. "But I think he will be."
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:53.000]   "I know Conall hates him just for being Roshin's son, but I like him. There's no malice in him."
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.000]   "Well, that's a rare thing," Kamlin observed.
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:04.000]   "And he did the right thing with Roshin. Choosing a downer over his mom wasn't easy."
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:10.000]   "True," Kamlin said. "Sometimes the right thing could be a grim thing too."
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:15.000]   "Aye, and it's weighing heavy on him. And you, by the look of it."
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:19.000]   Halion looked tired, a strained look about his eyes.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:23.000]   "Job done, then?" Kamlin asked Halion.
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:29.000]   "Aye," Halion breathed. "Got back yesterday. Did it go..."
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.000]   He was going to say well, but that didn't seem like the right word.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000]   Halion looked away, staring out into the marshland.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.000]   "Roshin didn't try to escape, if that's what you mean."
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.000]   "That's something," Kamlin said.
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:49.000]   "Aye," Halion shrugged. "Not the easiest thing I've done," he added, as Kamlin continued to stare at him.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:58.000]   "Thought you hated Roshin." "I do. She murdered my mom, wanted to kill me and Conall, was the reason we fled, Dawan."
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:04.000]   "And she would have murdered Adana too. Exile is better than she deserves. But..."
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:10.000]   Halion shrugged, his sea-gray eyes hinting at the emotion he kept buried within.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000]   Walking away was hard.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:21.000]   "Execution is hard, you mean. We called it exile, but leaving her in the middle of the marsh, it was a death sentence."
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000]   Kamlin patted Halion's shoulder.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000]   "Good hunting?" Halion asked him. "Aye."
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:35.000]   "There are a few less warriors in black and gold to tell the way to this place. Am I the first back?"
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000]   "No, you're the last," Halion said.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:45.000]   "We've all been waiting on you. Adana refused to hold the council until you were back, safe and sound."
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.000]   Kamlin felt himself blush at that, a smile twitching his lips.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000]   It felt strange to be valued.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.000]   Kamlin looked around the circle of familiar faces.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:02.000]   They were gathered in a clearing, amidst the ruins of what looked to have once been Duncran's gatehouse.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:08.000]   A collapsed tower rose above them, birds' nests poking from its crumbled ramparts.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:13.000]   The old wall lay in ruins, granite boulders scattered in the grass.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:21.000]   Beneath their feet, ancient flagstones lay twisted and shattered by the encroaching roots of willow and alder.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:26.000]   A crumbling archway framed Adana, who sat upon a moss-covered boulder.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:33.000]   She looked at home in a coat of mail and boiled leather surcoat, a grey cloak about her shoulders and a sword at her hip.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.000]   Surrounding her were those she trusted most closely.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:46.000]   Pendathrin, her barrel-chested uncle, and Drust, the red-haired warrior from Navon, once shieldman to Owain, Navon's fallen king.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:52.000]   Lorkhan, the young king-in-exile of Daewon, gazed solemnly at Adana.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:57.000]   The others that filled the area were mostly warriors, shieldmen to those present.
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.000]   Halyon, Von, and One-Eyed Baird watching Adana.
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:06.000]   Close to them, Brogan loomed protectively close to Lorkhan.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:15.000]   Craft perched upon the broken archway above Adana like a carved statue, and I've no doubt that Meg is eavesdropping somewhere close by.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:21.000]   Adana stood, and the quiet conversations that had whispered amongst the ruined walls hushed.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.000]   "We are leaving Dunkrin," she said, without any preamble.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.000]   Above her, Kraff ruffled his feathers.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.000]   "Leaving?" he called quietly.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.000]   "Our warriors' kin have only just returned," Drust objected.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:41.000]   "Not even dried their feet. And this is a good defensible spot."
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000]   There were rumbles of assent.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.000]   "After our victory, they don't want to leave. I've seen it before.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:54.000]   Victory makes them feel secure. But our enemy's no fool. Ryn's as canny as they come.
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000]   We'll not defeat her here again."
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000]   Ernie had said as much to Adana.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:02.000]   "I agree," Adana said. "We won the last skirmish.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.000]   Ryn and her battle chiefs underestimated us and did not scout well enough.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.000]   But they will not repeat that mistake, and they will be back.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:19.000]   We faced over five hundred swords, put more than three hundred in their cans, but however many we slew, some escaped.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.000]   They know where we are, and they will report back to Ryn.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:28.000]   Next time they will be cautious, and Ryn rules four realms now.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.000]   She has the numbers to keep throwing warriors at us until we are overwhelmed."
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.000]   And Atheryn nodded dowry in agreement.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000]   "But where else is there?"
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000]   "There are one or two other spots in these marshes," Drust said.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:47.000]   "Not as good as here, but still."
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:51.000]   "We need to change our tactics."
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.000]   "Only the families are staying in the marshes," Idana interrupted.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.000]   "I'm leading the warband out into Arden."
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:02.000]   "Arden?" Krafft muttered above Adana.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:06.000]   He didn't look pleased, the feathers of his neck suddenly bristling.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.000]   "What?" Pandafrin blurted.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:15.000]   "Now that is..." He paused, face turning redder as he made an obvious effort to master his tongue.
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000]   "Unwise."
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:22.000]   "We cannot win the war hiding in these marshes."
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:30.000]   "If Ryn is to be defeated and Arden, Navon, and Dowon set free, then we must take the battle to her."
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.000]   "We must become an enemy she fears."
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.000]   "Winning one battle does not decide the war," Drust said.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.000]   "You've done well, but we could lead Ryn a merry dance around these marshes."
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:49.000]   "I know full well that the war is not won," Idana said, her voice abruptly cold.
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:55.000]   "Do not patronize me. I am not a bairn and I am no stranger to loss and hardship."
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.000]   She looked around at them all.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:03.000]   "Each night I close my eyes, each day I awake I see the same thing."
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:09.000]   "My dead kin, my friends cut down, my home burning, my people."
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000]   "Who cares for them while we are here?"
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:22.000]   "Never forget what Ryn has taken from us. It is time we took something back. Time we took the battle to her."
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000]   Drust snorted.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000]   "We cannot face Ryn in open battle," Pandafrin growled.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:37.000]   "Of course not," Idana said. "We are too few in numbers," less than two hundred swords, "but we can use that to our advantage."
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:46.000]   "We can move quickly, strike fast, disappear, strike elsewhere, show Ryn and the people of Arden that we have teeth."
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.000]   Pandafrin nodded, obviously considering it.
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.000]   "That'll only last so long," he said.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:40:02.000]   "Indeed," Idana said, "which is why the word needs to spread that Ryn has lost a great battle, that her regent, Evnes, is dead."
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.000]   Her eyes flitted to Von, and she took a deep breath.
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.000]   "That the rightful Queen of Arden has returned."
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:18.000]   "The people need to know they have not been forgotten. I know them. They will join us if we offer them hope."
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.000]   Pandafrin glanced at Drust.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000]   They shared a long silence, then Drust nodded grimly.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:34.000]   "When did the girly I used to bounce upon my knee become this daring battle chief I see before me?" Pandafrin said.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:43.000]   Idana just smiled, though her eyes flickered in acknowledgement to Camlyn and Halion, who had had long conversations with her, discussing the options.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.000]   Though to be fair, much of this plan came from her.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:53.000]   There was a flapping of wings, and Kraff glided down to a light on the rock beside Idana.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.000]   "Drasil?" he croaked.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:01.000]   "I am afraid we are not going to Drasil," Idana said solemnly to the crow.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:08.000]   "Wrong, wrong, wrong," Kraff called, flapping his wings vehemently, muttering,
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.000]   "Godwall, Seven Treasures, Brinna, Corbin," over and over.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:21.000]   "We are needed here, Kraff," Idana said, reaching out a hand tentatively to touch the crow's ruffled feathers.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:27.000]   He looked at her then with a disgusted squawk flapped into the air and soared away.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:32.000]   Idana watched him for a few moments, a dark smudge that faded quickly.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.000]   Camlyn followed Idana from the clearing.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000]   The sun was dipping behind the trees.
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:42.000]   The smell of cooking from the lakeshore wafting over made Camlyn's belly grumble.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:49.000]   "What are you planning on doing with the plunder on the lakeshore?" he asked Idana, as he drew up alongside her.
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:55.000]   "Taking what we need, dumping the rest in the lake so that Rin can't use it," Idana replied.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:59.000]   "Make sure you keep the cloaks of black and gold," Camlyn said.
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000]   "Think they might come in handy."
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:06.000]   "I had thought exactly the same thing," Idana said with a vicious smile.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.000]   "My lady," a voice said behind them.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.000]   It was Von, his expression pensive.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.000]   They halted to let him catch up.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:21.000]   "Quaff? The things he said?"
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:27.000]   "I miss our friends as much as he does," Idana sighed impatiently, interrupting.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.000]   "Corbin? Brinna? Daph? Gar? The others?"
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:34.000]   She fell silent, eyes distant.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:42.000]   "But, much as I long to see them all again, I cannot dash off on a fool's errand to Drassil."
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:47.000]   "The journey alone would take half a year, and I have a duty to my people."
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000]   "You misunderstand me," Von said.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:56.000]   "It is the other things he said about the God War, about Drassil and..."
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000]   He took a deep breath.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:04.000]   "I need to talk to you about what my father told me before he died."
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.000]   "About what?" Idana said.
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.000]   "About the Seven Treasures," Von said quietly.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.000]   "I think I know where one of them is."
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:21.000]   Chapter Seven Corolin
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:27.000]   Corolin crouched beside Brinna and watched the healer run her hands over Storm's torso.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:32.000]   The Wolfen had closed her eyes again, her breathing so shallow that she appeared dead,
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:37.000]   but as Brinna's fingers probed Storm's ribs, there was a faint growl and the flash of teeth.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000]   A storm curled a lip.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.000]   "That hurts, then?" Brinna murmured.
[01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:50.000]   "Sorry, my darling," she soothed, fingers lifting a lip to look at the color of Storm's gums,
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:54.000]   opening an eyelid, lifting legs and bending them at the joints.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:44:01.000]   "It must be bad. Brinna never calls anyone 'my darling' even if they've lost body parts."
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:05.000]   Corolin looked up, hearing voices from beyond the ridge.
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:08.000]   Gar, organizing a search of the area.
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.000]   While desperate to go and help continue the search for Corbin,
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:17.000]   worried that the others might miss something, she still couldn't bear to leave Storm's side.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.000]   "Can you help her?" Corolin whispered.
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.000]   Brinna ignored her.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:29.000]   Eventually she paused, sat straight, her head bowed in thought.
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000]   She blew out a long breath and nodded,
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:37.000]   then with a quick movement she pulled out the file Corolin had seen her scrape giant's blood into.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.000]   She scooped out some of the congealing blood and muttered as she lifted Storm's lip
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.000]   and ran her finger across Storm's lolling tongue.
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:51.000]   "Fwel novit hert schlande argus neat."
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:58.000]   She repeated the phrase again and again, gently massaging Storm's throat to help her swallow.
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:02.000]   The air seemed to grow chill about them and Corolin shivered,
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.000]   feeling as if a spider had just crawled the length of her spine.
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:12.000]   Eventually, Storm shuddered, a spasm that rippled through her whole body.
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000]   Corolin was not sure if it was wishful thinking,
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:19.000]   but the Wolven's breathing seemed to become stronger, steadier.
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000]   Brinna stopped and looked at Corolin.
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000]   "What have you done?" Corolin whispered.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:31.000]   "Not a word to anyone," Brinna hissed fiercely, eyes locking onto Corolin's.
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:37.000]   "Without it, she is dead. She is too far gone. Even now, I cannot say."
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:43.000]   Gar dropped down beside them, his usually emotionless face twisted with concern.
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:48.000]   "Well?" he said, looking between Brinna and the Wolven.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:53.000]   Brinna held Corolin's eyes still, waiting.
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:58.000]   Corolin gave an imperceptible nod, and then Brinna sighed and shook her head.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:06.000]   "I don't know. She is battered, ribs broken, one lung punctured and collapsed.
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:11.000]   There is a hole through her shoulder and into her chest the size of my fist.
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:17.000]   If none of these things ends her still, the loss of blood might," she shrugged.
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000]   Her spirit strong.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:22.000]   "None stronger," Gar said.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:26.000]   "Aye, that may give her a chance," Brinna said.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:30.000]   "Can she be moved?" Gar asked. "No."
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:36.000]   "I'll set a guard. Corolin, I need your eyes in the search for Corbin."
[01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:41.000]   Corolin nodded. She brushed her fingertips across Storm's muzzle,
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:47.000]   shared a lingering look with Brinna, and then she was hauling herself up the ridge.
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:52.000]   Corolin stood staring at the corpse of the great bear, for a moment speechless.
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:57.000]   It was huge, twice the height of a horse and three times as wide.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000]   The bear was a patchwork of wounds.
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:05.000]   A great flap of flesh hung loose above its shoulder, more a tear than a cut.
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:10.000]   Half the length of its side had been opened with what looked like a sword cut,
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:15.000]   ribs shattered and flakes of white bones sprinkled amongst the red ruin.
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:21.000]   "Corbin," Corolin said, as she pointed to the sword wound in the bear's side.
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:28.000]   "That's not what killed it," Feral said, pointing away from the gaping slash in the bear's side.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000]   "That is."
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:35.000]   The bear's throat had been opened, the flesh lacerated and hanging.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000]   They'd all seen that type of wound before.
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.000]   "Storm," Gar said.
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:47.000]   "This is where we found them," Pax said, his voice raw with grief.
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.000]   "Where dar spear the giant?"
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.000]   "Describe this giant," Gar said.
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:03.000]   "Fair head, the color of fresh straw, a war hammer. He looked regal, in charge, and he was talking to Corbin."
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:07.000]   "Could it be Ildir?" Laith said.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:12.000]   Corolin felt a pulse of anger at the name saw Gar stiffen.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:15.000]   Ildir was the warlord of the Jotun.
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:23.000]   He had slain Tokel, Gar's father, at Graham's hold, and broken Gar's ribs when he had tried to avenge his dar's death.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:30.000]   The ground showed the signs of more bears, at least another four, maybe more, as well as other giants on foot.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:35.000]   Tracks led northwards into the forest away from Drassil.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:41.000]   Ildir and the Jotun had fought alongside Jael of Iseltir, who in turn was allied to Nefair.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:49.000]   So the logical conclusion was that the Jotun would have taken Corbin to Drassil, who would have joined the battle.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.000]   But their tracks headed north.
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000]   "Where are they going?" Corolin asked.
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:00.000]   Dath moved first, breaking the spell the dead bear had put upon them.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:06.000]   "Don't know, but we won't find them or a band by standing here," he said.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:13.000]   "When did this happen?" Gar asked. "Yesterday, after High Sun," Pax replied.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:21.000]   "We've seen no sign of a camp," Corolin said. "No cook fires, nowhere slept upon, little spore.
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:27.000]   My guess is that they set off after capturing Corbin, so there must have been enough light to make a good start.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:35.000]   If we follow their trail, see how much ground they covered before making camp, we'll get a better idea of how far ahead of us they are."
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:44.000]   Gar granted an agreement, and together they moved up a steep slope, entering an area of dense vegetation.
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:51.000]   The hill levelled out and opened up, sunshine breaking through the canopy above.
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:56.000]   It was past High Sun, the day beginning its slow crawl towards night.
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:02.000]   To the south, Corolin could see Drassil, pillars of smoke spiralling from it.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:09.000]   She looked back to the hill she was standing on, at the bear and giant tracks that led down the hill, north, away from Drassil.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:14.000]   The sound of movement drew Corolin to tension, a rustling.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:22.000]   Immediately her sword was in her fist and she was seeking cover, the others following suit, Dath with an arrow knocked.
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:27.000]   Leith pulled one of her throwing knives, as big as a sword, from the leather belt strapped across her chest.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:33.000]   Gar signalled to the jihah before, and behind them, and then they waited.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:45.000]   Beyond the peak of the hill, the forest was shrouded in shadow, hindering Corolin's vision, but the crunch of forest litter and approaching rustle amongst the foliage spoke of many feet.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:52.000]   A figure appeared, crouched, moving carefully, dark shadows taking form behind it.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:59.000]   Iron glinted. Then Gar was stepping from behind a tree, sheathing his sword and striding down the hill.
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:07.000]   "Well met," he said to Tahir, the shieldman of Halen, boy king of Iseltir.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:13.000]   The warrior gave a lopsided grin of relief and took Gar's forearm in the warrior grip.
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:19.000]   He was not overly tall but was broad and thick-muscled, his arms looking too long for his body.
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:27.000]   Dark hollows ringed his eyes, and there was a long tear across the shoulder of his chainmail shirt, blood caked around it.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:31.000]   "Been looking for you," Tahir said.
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:36.000]   "And you found us," Gar said. "How did you know where to search?"
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:45.000]   "One of my lads saw Michael defending the door to the northern tunnel. You don't defend a door for nothing.
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:51.000]   We retreated out of the main gate, made it to the forest and started circling this way."
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:59.000]   More men appeared behind him, forty, fifty, others hidden in the forest gloom, most wearing the red cloaks of Iseltir.
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:05.000]   "Taken us all night and half the day. Forest was crawling with Kadoshim and Vinthalan.
[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:09.000]   Think we've taught them to fear the forest better, though."
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:13.000]   A rumble of agreement spread through the warriors behind him.
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:17.000]   "Where's Halen?" Gar asked, and Tahir's face dropped.
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:21.000]   "I don't know. I tried to find him."
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:25.000]   Tahir's mouth twisted with something between pain and shame.
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:30.000]   "He's a resourceful lad," Gar said. "I'd wager he's found a hole to hide in."
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:34.000]   "I hope so," Tahir replied, a tremor in his voice.
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:43.000]   "How many were you?" Gar asked him. "Hundred and forty-six swords that can fight," Tahir said. "Another dozen wounded."
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:52.000]   "You've done well, saving so many," Gar said. "Aye, well, slow and steady wins the race, as my old ma'am used to say."
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:56.000]   Tahir looked around. "Where's Corbin?"
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:01.000]   "Taken. By the jotun. We have just found his trail."
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:10.000]   Tahir scowled and spat. "Giants," he muttered, then looked back to Gar. "So, what do we do now?"
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.000]   Gar looked at him and blinked.
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:25.000]   "With Corbin and Maikal gone, Gar is our natural leader now. And not just for us, but for all who fought at Drassil. He is Lord of the Je'har and Corbin's first sword."
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:33.000]   All Coralin wanted to do was find Corbin, but with survivors scattered throughout the forest, Gar had more to consider.
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:40.000]   "I'm going after Corbin," Gar said, and turned away to stare at the trail that led northwards.
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:45.000]   Tahir gripped his arm. "What about us?" he asked.
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:51.000]   "You and your warriors will rest a while. Drink, eat, tend to your wounds."
[01:53:51.000 --> 01:54:08.000]   "I don't just mean us," Tahir said, waving a hand at his men. "I mean the warband of Drassil. Many still live, can you not hear them still fighting? For Corbin, you cannot just abandon them."
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:12.000]   Gar stared at him, face twitching.
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:17.000]   Coralin crouched beside the burned-out fire and brushed the ash with her fingers.
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:22.000]   It was cold, not even the memory of heat lingering within it.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:28.000]   She glanced up, saw Dath at the edge of shadow poking at a mound of bear dung.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:33.000]   It was sunset. The forest was slipping into layers of shadow.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:40.000]   After talking with Tahir, Gar had sent out scouts to see if the survivors of Drassil could be brought together.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:45.000]   Coralin had left with Dath and Kolla to find the giant's camp.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:51.000]   She sprang up and ran from the site, easily following the path the giants had left.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:55:04.000]   "They are overly confident and making no effort to hide their passage. They would not think that we were hunting them. If only I could reach them, it may be possible to steal Corbin back in the darkness."
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:15.000]   "It's too dark. We'll lose their trail." Dath called after her, but she ignored him, just ran on into the forest, following the tracks up a steep incline.
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:24.000]   She climbed it and stopped, kicking at a moss-covered stone, her heart sinking as she realized the implications of what she could see.
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:31.000]   "The old giant's road," she said to Dath and Kolla as they joined her. It had been rebuilt by Jael's warband.
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:41.000]   "And they're moving fast." "Aye," Kolla said. "Wherever they're going, they want to get there quickly and are not worried about any pursuit."
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:47.000]   "Probably think we're all a bit busy with Nathanra and Drassil," Dath added. He looked at Coralin.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:57.000]   "How far ahead do you think they are?" "A day," Coralin grunted. "If they stick to that ruined road, maybe ten, twelve leagues?"
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:02.000]   "We'll not catch them this night, then." Coralin sucked in a long breath.
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:07.000]   "No," she growled. "What do you want to do?" Dath asked her.
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:12.000]   "I want to keep running. Keep moving until we find them. Find him."
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:18.000]   "But there would be no quick rescue now. They would be fortunate to catch them in half a ten night."
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:21.000]   "Probably longer if their bears have an open run."
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:33.000]   "Back to Gar," she said. They had made it back to camp in good time, considering they were traveling almost blind, the moonlight little more than a shimmer above the forest canopy.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:40.000]   Warriors were everywhere, clustered around small fires that had been surrounded by wicker panels to hide their glow.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:48.000]   Coralin saw Gar standing beside a larger fire with a group around him. Tahir was there as well as others whom she was pleased to see.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:59.000]   Wolf in his bear pelt, her notched axe resting across his shoulder. Javed, the pit fighter, small and wiry, a giant outlined behind them.
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:08.000]   Gar saw her enter the glade and their eyes met. Coralin nodded, signaling that she'd found the giant's camp.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:18.000]   "We should strike. Attack Drasil now," Javed said. "They'd not be expecting that. The Vintalan are in there."
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:25.000]   There was a barely contained rage edging his voice. "Lycus is there. The man who gave me this."
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:31.000]   He twisted to show the scar burned into the back of his shoulder, a twisting spiral.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:42.000]   "He and his kind did this and worse to many of us," Javed said, waving a hand at his warriors. Angry murmurs spread amongst them.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:47.000]   "Kick a stone in anger, you'll hurt your foot," Tahir said.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:54.000]   Javed just stared at him. The giant behind them laughed, a low rumbling like drums.
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:58:02.000]   "Just something my old ma'am used to say," Tahir muttered. "And what the hell does it mean?" Javed scowled.
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:09.000]   "That acting from anger will get you killed," Gar said. "Anger is the enemy."
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:18.000]   He turned to the group close to him. "Phakhan of the Benothi," Gar continued. "What would your clan advise?"
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:25.000]   The giant stepped forwards into the firelight, a double-bladed axe silhouetted across his shoulder.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:36.000]   "Bala One-Eye is wounded on the edge of life and death. Aetlyn will not leave him. We will not fight without her."
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:41.000]   Gar nodded thoughtfully. "How many of your kin are with you?"
[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:50.000]   "A score. Perhaps more are scattered in fawn," the giant shrugged. "I will send Brina with you when you return to them."
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:55.000]   "Good." "Aetlyn Badme asked for her."
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:02.000]   "We cannot just do nothing," Javed snapped. "I do not intend to do nothing," Gar said.
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:11.000]   Other voices joined in, each proposing a different way forward attacks, ambushes, strategies. This could go on all night.
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:17.000]   Kuralin slipped across the glade, moving beyond the small council to the side of the glade.
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:23.000]   A makeshift rope ladder hung over the edge, another fire flickering below by the river's bank.
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:35.000]   Kuralin climbed nimbly down to find Brina with Storm. Feral was there too, sitting with his back to the slope, eyes closed, a big hand resting upon Storm's shoulder.
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:38.000]   "How is she?" Kuralin asked.
[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:43.000]   Brina looked at her with sad eyes, tears glittering in the firelight.
[01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:48.000]   "I fear she will not win this fight," the healer said.
[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:56.000]   Kuralin's heart lurched in her chest. "But she used magic," said a spell. "But what you did—"
[01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:03.000]   "It has helped," Brina said, giving her strength. "But her wounds—"
[02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:07.000]   She looked at Feral, then lowered her voice to little more than a whisper.
[02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:16.000]   "And I used giant's blood. Another wolfen or something closer to her own species would have more power."
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:24.000]   "There is a dead bear? Half a league from here?" Kuralin said. "One of those Jotun giants, right?"
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.000]   Brina reached into her cloak and removed an empty file.
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:36.000]   "Feel this with its blood," she said, taking Kuralin's hand and closing her fingers about it.
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:44.000]   She glanced at Storm, at the wolfen's shallow breathing. "And be quick about it!" Kuralin was.
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:48.000]   Most of the camp was sleeping when she returned from her gristly task.
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:53.000]   Gar and the other leaders were still in deep conversation.
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:01:00.000]   Brina was alone with Storm, the small fire crackling, casting shadows across the healer and wolfen.
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:08.000]   Without a word, Brina took the file and massaged the fluid into Storm's gums and tongue.
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:20.000]   "Fwyl, novit, alaart, a slaand arghas nyart," Brina muttered, over and over, her voice sounding like a stick scratching on slate.
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:27.000]   Kuralin's flesh goose bumped. The fire seemed to dim and then flare. A twig popped.
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:33.000]   The wolfen stirred, lifting her head to regard Brina with her amber wolfen eyes.
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:39.000]   "Come back to us," Brina whispered. "Corbin needs you."
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:46.000]   Storm's legs twitched and she gave a weak rumbling growl, then with a sigh she laid her head back on the turf.
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:51.000]   "Thank you," Brina said to Kuralin, looking weary.
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:58.000]   Dirt skittered about them, and Dath, Kulla, and Laith appeared out of the darkness, waking Feral.
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:04.000]   "How is she?" Dath asked. "A little stronger," Brina said.
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:10.000]   "We'll take it in turns to watch over her," Feral said. "Even you must need to sleep."
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:15.000]   "Well, for once you may be right," Brina muttered.
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:19.000]   She curled down beside the fire, pulling her cloak over her head.
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:26.000]   "Wake me, if there is any change. And no going to sleep on watch."
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:31.000]   A bony finger poked out of the cloak and wagged at them all.
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:36.000]   Within moments Brina's breathing changed, became slower and deeper.
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:44.000]   "So," Dath whispered to Kuralin once they were all sure that Brina was soundly asleep, "when do we leave?"
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:51.000]   "What do you mean?" Kuralin asked. "You'll be going after Corbin. We're coming too."
[02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:58.000]   Kuralin had decided to leave a little before first light, to slip away before the camp woke and started asking her questions.
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:02.000]   She needed to use every moment of daylight possible.
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:05.000]   "Perhaps leave a message for Gar."
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:12.000]   It was clear that he was needed here, that his duties would force him to stay and oversee the fight against Nathare.
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:19.000]   "You can't come," Kuralin said. "Feral and Laith will be too noisy, too slow."
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000]   Feral leaned forwards.
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:30.000]   "Band, my friend. More than that. Closer than kin. I'm going after him, with you or without you." He shrugged.
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:34.000]   "I'd rather we travel together, but I'll not be staying here."
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:38.000]   Kuralin looked at them all, saw the resolve in their eyes.
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:42.000]   "All right then," she said. "Before dawn."
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:53.000]   Morning came gray and damp, false dawn giving a half-light that helped Kuralin to see beyond the fire glow that kept crackling all night to give Storm a little warmth.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:04:01.000]   Feral, Daph, Color, and Laith had all stayed, taking it in terms to watch over Storm.
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:07.000]   Now, silently, they all stood, checked weapons and packs.
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:14.000]   "I would come with you, if not for Storm," Brin said as she stirred within her cloak.
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:18.000]   "We know," Kuralin answered.
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:24.000]   Brinna checked on the sleeping wolfen. "Her heart beats stronger," she said.
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:28.000]   "That is good news," Kuralin grinned.
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:37.000]   She crouched beside the wolfen and ran her fingers through the thick fur of her neck, then leaned forwards and kissed Storm's head.
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:41.000]   "I'll be back. With Corbin," she whispered.
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:46.000]   "Bring him back," Brinna said, watching them leave.
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.000]   "I mean to, or die in the trying."
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:53.000]   The camp in the glade above was still and silent.
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:57.000]   Kuralin and the others picked their way through the sleeping figures.
[02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:01.000]   As they slipped amongst the trees, a figure stepped out in front of them.
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000]   "Gah."
[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:07.000]   He had a pack slung across his back, a grim look upon his face.
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:11.000]   He nodded as he looked fiercely at the small gathering.
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:15.000]   "Good. Let's be after him then."
[02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:20.000]   "We thought you were needed here, that you would have to stay," Kuralin said.
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000]   He gave her a withering look.
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:29.000]   "Only death would stop me going after ban."
[02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:33.000]   Chapter 8 Corbin
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:36.000]   Corbin woke to pain.
[02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:44.000]   He opened his eyes, stared up at a dappled canopy of leaf and branch, grey light leaking through it.
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:49.000]   It was passing him by like clouds scudding across the sky.
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:53.000]   "No, not the trees. It is I that am moving."
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:58.000]   "And I am in Faun," he realized. "Still in Faun."
[02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000]   He felt relief at that.
[02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:03.000]   Being in Faun was not such a bad thing.
[02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:11.000]   He liked the forest, and it also meant that he was not a thousand leaks from Drassil and his friends, if any of them had survived.
[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:14.000]   But the constant rocking, bumping motion wasn't such a good thing,
[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:23.000]   making his chest spike with pain and exacerbating the deep, dull throb in his knee, pulsing out in time with his heartbeat.
[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:30.000]   Also, there was a terrible stink in his nose, musky and stale, making him want to gag.
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:33.000]   Time passed in something of a haze.
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:38.000]   His mind drifted and he thought of the other world, of his meeting with Maeko.
[02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:42.000]   He used me. Manipulated me. Lied to me.
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:48.000]   But his words had also rung true. He needed to find his friends to be at their side.
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000]   How?
[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000]   That is the question.
[02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000]   When I am broken and battered.
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:58.000]   A prisoner, traveling Elion knows where.
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:06.000]   He moved his head slowly from side to side, saw that he was on a makeshift litter that was being dragged through the forest.
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:14.000]   Behind him, a huge figure loomed, thick with fur, a black snout and muzzle, yellowed teeth edging its jaw.
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:19.000]   A bear. One of the Jotun's bears.
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:26.000]   Their face reared over him, pale and blond-haired, a long-braided moustache drooping down almost to Corbin's face.
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:31.000]   Corbin recognized him as one of the giants that had dragged him away from Storm.
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:37.000]   "I'll kill you," Corbin hissed, instinctively reaching for his sword.
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:43.000]   When his fingers reached the empty scabbard, he remembered that he'd left it in the body of a giant,
[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:49.000]   back in the glade where he and Storm had fought and slain three of this giant's kin.
[02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:54.000]   The giant's eyes watched Corbin's gasping breathlessness and grunted.
[02:07:54.000 --> 02:08:01.000]   "You'll not be killing any more of us Jotun today," the giant said in stilted speech.
[02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:06.000]   "But I like your spirit," he chuckled.
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:09.000]   "There's fire in this pup's belly yet."
[02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:12.000]   "Holla," he called over his shoulder.
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:16.000]   "Seems you'll make a healer after all."
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:22.000]   "I've been one for four hundred years, you idiot," a voice called back.
[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:29.000]   The giant looked back at Corbin and checked the binding of his leg splint, sending jolts of pain through Corbin.
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:33.000]   "Don't go dying on us," the giant said.
[02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:38.000]   Another giant face appeared beside it, this one red-haired and glowering.
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:43.000]   "Here knows Wolf and Kilderon, Rolf and Lut," it rumbled,
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:48.000]   reaching round with a hand the size of a shovel and cuffing Corbin across the head.
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:53.000]   Just the blow was painful enough, but the fire it ignited in Corbin's chest was like a hammer strike,
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:57.000]   and he screamed, the world fading to darkness.
[02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:02.000]   The last sound he heard was giant voices yelling at each other.
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:06.000]   "Drink this," a voice said.
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:10.000]   Something was shoved into his hand, a bowl, and to his surprise,
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:16.000]   he found that he was propped up against the trunk of a tree, a rope tying him to the wide bowl.
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:19.000]   Not that I can get up and run away.
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:25.000]   Two giants were crouched before him, both of them cloaked in the twilight gloom of Faun.
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:29.000]   One of them was the blonde giant he'd talked to earlier.
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:36.000]   Beyond them, he heard the familiar sound of camp-making, shadowy figures moving at the edge of his sight.
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:44.000]   "Drink," the voice said, a huge hand wrapping around his and lifting the bowl to his lips.
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:49.000]   Corbin sniffed it, wrinkling his nose with a familiar earthly smell.
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:52.000]   "Brot," he muttered.
[02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.000]   "You know Brot?" the voice said in surprise.
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:01.000]   Corbin looked into the gloom and saw that one of the dark figures before him was a woman,
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:07.000]   her face slabs of bone highlighted by the dim gleam of moonlight.
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:10.000]   "Aye," Corbin mumbled.
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:13.000]   He sniffed suspiciously at the bowl.
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:16.000]   "Go on," the voice said.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:20.000]   "If we wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already."
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000]   "That's a fair point."
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000]   "Why haven't they killed me?"
[02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:29.000]   He took a sip, the brats closer to porridge in consistency than fluid.
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:34.000]   After swallowing, he felt an aftertaste, something bitter.
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.000]   "It's not the same," Corbin said.
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:38.000]   "As what?"
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:41.000]   "As what Balor gave me."
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000]   There was a pause.
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000]   The giant shared a look.
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:50.000]   "Balor, one eye," the blond-haired male asked.
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000]   "Aye," Corbin said.
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000]   "There's something else in this.
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000]   Golden seal."
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:57.000]   Another silence.
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:00.000]   "Aye," the female giant said.
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000]   She almost sounded pleased.
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:05.000]   "Golden seal to fight infection," Bryn always said.
[02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:08.000]   "The worse it tastes, the better it is for you."
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000]   I never quite believed that bit.
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:14.000]   Another figure loomed out of the shadows.
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.000]   "Boger."
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:21.000]   The giant rumbled, and his captors parted to let this one crouch down before Corbin.
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:24.000]   "Adron," the new arrival said.
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:32.000]   And a moment later Corbin heard flint being struck, sparks catching on a torch and light flared.
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:36.000]   Corbin blinked, looked away a moment.
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:43.000]   "Look at me," the new voice said, a grating rumble stern and grim.
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:46.000]   A hand gripped Corbin's face and lifted his chin.
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:53.000]   He was looking at another blond giant, a thick warrior braid in his hair, threaded with red gold wire.
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:59.000]   This one had a wide bandage wrapped around his shoulder and chest, a dark stain at its center.
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:05.000]   "You are Ildir, King of the Jotun," Corbin said.
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:09.000]   "Warlord, not king," Ildir murmured.
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:13.000]   "But who are you?"
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:17.000]   "Why am I still breathing?" Corbin asked.
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:21.000]   "I slew your bear, three of your kin in the glade."
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000]   With a lot of help from Storm.
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000]   "Why would you keep me alive?"
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:30.000]   "You do not question me," Ildir said.
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:35.000]   Then with one thick finger trotted Corbin in his ribs.
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:40.000]   Corbin suppressed a scream. It came out as a gurgled hiss.
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:48.000]   Ildir's hand brushed over Corbin's torn surcoat, rested on the sigil of the bright star stitched upon his chest,
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.000]   felt his mail shirt rolling links between his fingers.
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:57.000]   He grunted approvingly then moved onto Corbin's arm ring wrapped around his bicep.
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:06.000]   It had been gifted to him in Drassil, a spiral of dark iron veined with a silver thread, a snarling wolfen head at each end.
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:12.000]   It was a thing of beauty, more so because it reminded Corbin of the night back in Drassil
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:18.000]   when the whole of the warband had pledged their loyalty to him and he had sworn his oath to them in return.
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:23.000]   He felt a lump rise in his throat and blinked away tears.
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:28.000]   "Who are you?" Ildir asked him again.
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:34.000]   "No one," Corbin grunted, feeling a surge of bitter despair at that admission.
[02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:39.000]   "Certainly not the bright star everyone believed I was. I even came to believe it.
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:43.000]   I am the greatest of fools. That is who I am."
[02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:52.000]   "There is giant skill in this," Ildir observed, fingers running over the spiral of the arm ring.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:57.000]   At Graham's hold, warriors stood about you.
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:03.000]   "You commanded and others listened and yesterday men came to save you."
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:09.000]   He moved closer, face almost touching Corbin's his small dark eyes staring.
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:15.000]   "I do not think you are no one. Start with your name. Tell me that."
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000]   Corbin clamped his lips together.
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:26.000]   "I could hurt you," Ildir said, matter-of-factly, hand opening and resting lightly upon Corbin's injured knee.
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:29.000]   Corbin sucked in a breath but said nothing.
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:34.000]   "Your name?" Ildir said, flexing his fingers.
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:39.000]   "Something for something," Corbin said, as calmly as he could manage.
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:48.000]   Ildir stared at him a long sweat-fueled moment. Then a smile cracked the slabs of the giant's face, his moustache twitching.
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:15:03.000]   "You have stones, little man. I'll give you that. Bargaining with me at a time like this? Very well. Something for something.
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:06.000]   Now, what is your name?"
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:13.000]   "I am Corbin Ben Thanon," Corbin said, lifting his chin high.
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:18.000]   "That is who I am. My father's son, no more, no less."
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:24.000]   At that moment he had never missed his dial more fiercely nor felt so proud of his memory.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:29.000]   Ildir nodded thoughtfully, as if he were turning the name over in his mind.
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:35.000]   "All right, then," the giant finally said. "Ask your question."
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:38.000]   "Where are you taking me?" Corbin asked.
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:46.000]   "Away from Drassil and this cursed forest," Ildir said, looking up at the shifting shadows and impenetrable trees around them.
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:56.000]   "Where?" Corbin repeated. "A place you know well enough. We are going to Gram's Hold."
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:02.000]   Chapter 9 Fidole
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:10.000]   Fidole walked the lines of their camp, nodding to guards, offering a word of encouragement here and there.
[02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:16.000]   Trees loomed towering colossi that transformed daylight into perpetual twilight.
[02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:24.000]   Within this shadowed world, the Warband of Ripper camped. Close to a thousand men, five hundred leagues from home.
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:32.000]   They must wonder why they are here so far from home, caught up in a war they hardly understand. A war that I barely understand.
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:38.000]   What she did know, though, was that her son was at the heart of it. Nefair.
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:42.000]   At the thought of him, a tide of emotions swept through her.
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:49.000]   Shock! He is allied to the Kadishim, my own son. How could he choose to be part of such a great evil?
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:55.000]   Anger that he had not chosen differently, that he had not stood for what was right.
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:17:02.000]   He is naive, has trusted flattering words and deceptive tongues and walked the wrong path.
[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:09.000]   Betrayal that he had chosen Callidus over her, a point made so clear during her trial.
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:16.000]   Regret that she had not seen the course he was treading earlier and done something to help him while there had still been time.
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:23.000]   Sadness. No. Something far deeper than that. More akin to grief.
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:29.000]   It almost felt as if he had died, that she had lost him forever.
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:36.000]   Not forever. There is still hope for him. There must be... hatred.
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:47.000]   For Callidus, the catalyst and center of her fury, a Kadishim demon made flesh, his will set on corrupting Nefair and bending him to his purposes.
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:51.000]   Threaded between and amongst all those emotions was one more.
[02:17:51.000 --> 02:18:01.000]   Love. A mother's love for her son, built upon the vulnerable child she had nursed at her breast, whom she had nurtured and protected.
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:09.000]   A fierce love that had always seen the best in him, that believed in his ability, his strength and intellect, believed in him.
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:17.000]   A love that still fueled a hope that he would eventually see the wrong he had done, that he would turn back from the dark path he was being led down.
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:24.000]   At the perimeter of their camp, two guards with the eagle of Tenebraal upon their breastplates saluted her.
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:28.000]   Men always stood together in this forest, never alone.
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:32.000]   The creatures of form were better defended against that way.
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:36.000]   Fidele stood and stared out into the shadows of the forest.
[02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:41.000]   "We must leave," a voice said beside her, making her jump.
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:49.000]   Albin, the white-haired healer, had followed her his footsteps little more than a whisper upon the forest floor.
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:58.000]   A bandage was wrapped around the wound between his shoulder and chest that the traitorous Ektor had given in the dungeons beneath Brickhan.
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:05.000]   Quiet, shy Ektor, brother to Krellis and Veridis, more accustomed to holding a scroll than a sword.
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:12.000]   And yet, he had betrayed them and slain one of her most trusted companions, Peritas.
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:19.000]   It had been little more than a ten night ago and her grief was still fresh, but Albin seemed to have recovered well.
[02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:23.000]   He is a remarkable man. And a mysterious one.
[02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:27.000]   A warrior. And a healer, both, but so much more than that.
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:32.000]   Friend to Maekal, part of a secret group that has been waiting for these days, preparing.
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:37.000]   "We must leave," Albin repeated. "Time is against us."
[02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:42.000]   "No," she replied. An automatic response.
[02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:46.000]   She drew in a long breath, composing herself.
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:52.000]   "This warband will not just march away from Krellis. They are men of Ripa."
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:58.000]   "They'll do what you order them to do," Albin said quietly. "You are their queen."
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:04.000]   "I don't want to be queen. So many years I've put duty first."
[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:08.000]   She looked at Albin, saw him studying her face.
[02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:11.000]   "He knows why I do not wish to leave."
[02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:15.000]   "I'll not leave without Maekin."
[02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:21.000]   The warrior's face filled her mind, beaten and scarred, proud, fierce.
[02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:32.000]   She felt her spirits lift at the thought of him, remembered sitting at his side in the tower at Ripa, when he had opened his eyes after lying on the brink of death for so long.
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:38.000]   He had told her that he'd stood upon the Bridge of Swords, that one of the Ben Elim had given him a choice.
[02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:43.000]   To cross over, or go back, he told her.
[02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:46.000]   "Why did you come back, then?" she'd asked him.
[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:49.000]   "Three reasons. Three people."
[02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:53.000]   "Jael. Lycus. You."
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:56.000]   He had paused and looked up into her eyes.
[02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:01.000]   "Two for vengeance. One for love."
[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:05.000]   Her lips twitched in a smile at the memory of it.
[02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:09.000]   Albin's eyes creased with worry and perhaps compassion.
[02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:13.000]   "You'll lose this war? For one man?"
[02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:20.000]   So many answers flashed through her mind, most of them convincing in their own right, but she knew they were not the truth.
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:23.000]   "It will not come to that," she snapped.
[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000]   Albin frowned.
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:50.000]   "You cannot choose one man over a nation," he said. "More than that, the whole of the Banished Lands. We are in the God War. We cannot just walk away from this. It will consume the Banished Lands, and when it is done, those who stand against Azeroth will either be victorious or they will be dead. There is nothing in between. It is war. Sacrifices must be made."
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:22:16.000]   "I am familiar with sacrifice," she said coldly, "but I'll not be a pawn to an absent god. I'll fight for my freedom, for my people, and follow my conscience. Yes, I fear for Maquon and I long for his return, but more than that, this warband is stronger with him and with Krellas. And Veridis, if they manage to find him. We must give them more time."
[02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:24.000]   "They may never return, my lady," Albin said quietly, voicing her deepest fear.
[02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:27.000]   Doubt and worry gnawed at her.
[02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:37.000]   She remembered standing on the riverbank beyond Brickhan's tower as the warband escaped deeper into the forest, camouflaged amongst Nathare's warriors.
[02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:48.000]   Maquon, Albin, and Krellas had stood with her, looking back at the tower, thinking of Veridis and what he had vowed to do. To slay Calidus, one of the Karashim.
[02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:56.000]   They had all seen the explosion of fire light up the tower window and moments later seen the forms leak from it, hurtling into the river.
[02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:00.000]   It was Veridis. They were sure.
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:10.000]   Maquon and Krellas had made to rush after him then and there, but Albin had stayed them a while, calling out names and gathering a score of men to go with them.
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:17.000]   Maquon had crushed her in a tight embrace. "Stay," she had whispered in his ear.
[02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:22.000]   "Veridis is my friend," Maquon had replied, "and he freed us."
[02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:28.000]   She'd held his gaze a long heartfelt moment and then he was gone, running into the night.
[02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:31.000]   Was that our last moment together?
[02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:40.000]   "My lady," one of the guards close by said, pointing into the darkness of Fawn Forest, "someone approaches."
[02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:46.000]   Fidale stared into the shadows, Albin tense beside her, a fist clamped around the hilt of his sword.
[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:51.000]   One of the guards had raised a horn to his lips, ready to sound the call to arms.
[02:23:51.000 --> 02:24:03.000]   Figures separated from the gloom. Dark silhouettes. Six, seven, then one more, looming behind the others, dwarfing them. A giant.
[02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:10.000]   Swords were scraping from scabbards. Then Fidale recognized the first figure as it passed through a beam of daylight.
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:15.000]   Albin reached a hand out to the guard with a horn to his lips and pulled the horn away.
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:19.000]   One of the scouts, whom Albin had since watched the road.
[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:23.000]   He was leading a group through the forest towards their camp.
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:28.000]   She felt her pulse quicken as her eyes scanned the shapes behind him.
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:34.000]   And then she was running, pushing past the guards, ferns and branches whipping at her face.
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:42.000]   Another figure was moving ahead of the scout, running towards her, eloping stride, all controlled strength and grace.
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000]   Maquon.
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:50.000]   He opened his stride and ran ahead of the others, meeting Fidale between two great oaks.
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:57.000]   They fell into each other, Maquon's arms gripping her around the waist and crushing her against him.
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:03.000]   Her lips found his, and the next few moments were lost to the scent and taste of him.
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:09.000]   Eventually she heard the others approaching and stepped back, hands still holding his, and looked at him.
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:14.000]   He was sweat-stained, hair pressed dark against his head.
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:19.000]   And he was smiling at her, softening the hard lines and scars upon his face.
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:23.000]   He reached out and brushed a strand of hair from her cheek.
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:30.000]   "Now, that's a greeting worth fighting demons from the other world for," he said.
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:34.000]   "Even if it is most unqueenly behavior."
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:38.000]   A glance acknowledged the eyes gathering upon them.
[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:42.000]   "I am more than just a queen," Fidale said with a shrug.
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:49.000]   "And besides, in these times, death feels never more than a few steps behind us.
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:55.000]   While I still draw breath, I'll live my life as I choose."
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:26:00.000]   Her eyes drifted to his bare arm, a jagged wound hastily stitched.
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:03.000]   It looked more like an animal bite than the product of a weapon.
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:06.000]   The edges were torn and bloodied.
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:11.000]   He saw her gaze upon the injury and shrugged wryly.
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:15.000]   "Can you never come back to me without a fresh wound?"
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:19.000]   "It's a bad habit, I must confess," he smiled at her.
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:27.000]   The others gathered about them now, and Fidale saw Krellis standing with Veridis, the bulk of Alsion the giant behind them.
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:35.000]   They were both blood-stained and sweating, exhausted, but both of them were grinning at Albin as the old warrior hugged them both.
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:43.000]   There was a crashing behind her, and they all turned to see Rain of the giant's ass and her bear and plowing through the undergrowth towards them.
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:48.000]   Alsion pushed past Krellis and Veridis, sending them flying, and met his family with an inhuman howl,
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:54.000]   their arms wrapping around one another, holding, squeezing as if they were becoming one.
[02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:59.000]   Slowly, they sank to their knees, still entwined, a shuddering sound pulsating from them.
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000]   Alsion sobs.
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:10.000]   He held their faces, smothered them both with kisses, wife and son, and their tears and smiles mingled with his.
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:14.000]   In such dark times as these, it was heartwarming to see such love.
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:21.000]   She gripped Makin's hand more tightly in her own, if only such happiness could last.
[02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:25.000]   "So, what now?" Krellis asked them.
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:30.000]   The small gathering were sitting around the burned-out remains of a fire pit in the center of their camp.
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:33.000]   "We must go to Drassil," Albin said.
[02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:37.000]   "Must we?" Krellis asked, looking around at them all.
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:44.000]   "I'm not one to walk away from a fight, but I've just lost nineteen men to..."
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000]   His voice trailed off.
[02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:49.000]   "To demons of the Otherworld," Veridis said.
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000]   "To the Kadashim."
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:57.000]   "Still can't quite believe it," Krellis muttered, wiping a hand across his eyes.
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:02.000]   "I'm not one for fairy tales," he said, "but I know what I saw.
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:08.000]   My blade in an enemy's heart, and the bloody creature just smiled at me.
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:12.000]   I had to take his head to stop him trying to rip my throat out.
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:18.000]   I saw winged things of mist and shadow forming above the headless corpses."
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:19.000]   He shook his head.
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:30.000]   "If we go to Drassil, it sounds as if we'll fetch an army of these things. My men are warriors, bred for battle, brave and true-hearted.
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:37.000]   But they are only men of flesh and blood. So, I must ask this question."
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000]   His gaze returned to Albin.
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:43.000]   "Is this our fight?"
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:46.000]   Slowly, Albin nodded.
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:51.000]   "It is," he said. "This is the God War, Krellis.
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:57.000]   My Kal and the Bright Star are there, so Drassil must be where it will be decided."
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:01.000]   "The battle is most likely already over," Krellis said.
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:07.000]   "Nefair and his allies have at least a ten-night's march on us."
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:11.000]   "If we do not go, who else will?" Albin said.
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:14.000]   "It is our duty to go."
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:20.000]   "My duty is to my men," Krellis said, waving a hand at the warband about them.
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:26.000]   "And to the people of Tenebraal. We are less than a thousand swords. We cannot win.
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:32.000]   A strategic man would withdraw, live to fight another day when the odds are more in our favor."
[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:38.000]   "There will not be another day if we do not fight now," Albin said.
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:47.000]   "Kalidus and Nefair will destroy our allies one by one. We must stand with those who oppose them now before it is too late."
[02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:52.000]   "And what if there's none of these allies left alive at Drassil by the time we get there?"
[02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:57.000]   "We won't know unless we go there," Albin replied.
[02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:02.000]   A silence lengthened, all looking between Krellis and Albin.
[02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:09.000]   "Well, maybe you're right," Krellis eventually said, nodding thoughtfully.
[02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:16.000]   "I've always come to you when it's wisdom I've been looking for. But what if you're wrong?"
[02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:24.000]   "Marching deep into the heart of Faun, into unknown ground against a foe that outnumbers us greatly.
[02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:29.000]   That's not wisdom. Not when we could retreat and choose our own ground.
[02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:34.000]   But still, this is a fight we must all agree to.
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:47.000]   Say to all of you, ask you all, as my brothers-in-arms, are you for this fight, here, now? Are you for Drassil, or are you for home?"
[02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:55.000]   "Home," thought Fidele. "Part of me longs to find a place of peace with Makin where this war cannot touch us.
[02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:58.000]   But is there a place far enough from this war to escape it?"
[02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:06.000]   "And even if there were, I would not abandon the people of Tenebraal to death and torment. And then there is an affair.
[02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:11.000]   But whatever he has done, he is still my son. I cannot just leave him."
[02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:16.000]   "Well?" Krellis said, dragging Fidele from her thoughts.
[02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:24.000]   "We are friends here. Equals. We have not been ordered by our lord or king. We are free to choose.
[02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:35.000]   Let us put it to the vote. As for me, I say we leave this forest behind us. Back to Tenebraal to raise more swords and choose our battleground."
[02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:39.000]   "I am for Drassil," Albin said.
[02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:44.000]   Fidele looked around the fire pit, saw all lost in their own deliberations.
[02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:53.000]   "I would go to Drassil," she thought, "to save my son and for vengeance upon Lycus. But Krellis speaks wisdom."
[02:31:53.000 --> 02:32:01.000]   "What of you, little brother?" Krellis asked. "Are you for the great tree or for home on the bay?"
[02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:06.000]   Veridis finally raised his head and regarded them all with his dark, serious eyes.
[02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:13.000]   "I have been a fool, been deceived, and committed dark deeds in the name of good."
[02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:17.000]   His face twisted with a bit of grimace as he looked at his open palms.
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:21.000]   "Much blood those hands have spilt for Calidus."
[02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:28.000]   "I would do what I can to put that right," Veridis continued. "But how?" he mused.
[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:32.000]   "My heart says Drassil. My head says home."
[02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:37.000]   "Krellis is right. We do not know what awaits us at Drassil, though I do know this.
[02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:45.000]   Calidus has charged Jael of Iseltir, Gundul of Carnatan, and Lothar of Helveth to build roads to Drassil.
[02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:49.000]   And with them, they bring the full might of their realms."
[02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:55.000]   "If we managed to make the long journey through Faun, we would face impossible odds at the end of it."
[02:32:55.000 --> 02:33:00.000]   "Not if Mycal and the Brightstar still stand," Albin said.
[02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:08.000]   "And if they have fallen," Krellis said, "you are advising us to do the opposite of all you have taught.
[02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:14.000]   Know your enemy. Choose your ground. That's what you've always told me."
[02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:18.000]   Krellis shook his head. "I know," Albin admitted.
[02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:24.000]   "What of you?" Krellis asked, shifting his gaze to Alcyon and the giants.
[02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:31.000]   Rayna was cutting Alcyon's hair with her knife, leaving the top long and thick, the sides shaved to the skin.
[02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:36.000]   "What is she doing to him? He looks more fearsome than ever before."
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:41.000]   "We will travel with you, whichever way you go."
[02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:45.000]   "If you will have us," Alcyon said.
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:50.000]   "And why would you wish to join us?" Krellis asked, eyes narrowing.
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:54.000]   "Why not just leave now and go back to your clan?"
[02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:59.000]   "Two reasons," Alcyon said, his voice like gravel.
[02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:05.000]   "A blood debt," he glanced at Veridis, "and a blood feud."
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:10.000]   As he said the last, his fists clenched, knuckles popping.
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:22.000]   "Calidus made me a slave. Kept my family prisoner. I would even that score. Fight him now, fight him later."
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:27.000]   Alcyon shrugged. "As long as I fight him, I care not."
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:35.000]   "If you don't mind me asking," Krellis added to Alcyon, "why the new haircut?"
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:41.000]   Alcyon rubbed the side of his head stubble rasping on his palm, the hair on the top of his head a thick wedge.
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:51.000]   "This is my clan's tradition. When Calidus caught me and bent me to his will, I was Kurgan no longer."
[02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:59.000]   "I did not deserve the mark of my clan. But now I am Kurgan again."
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:02.000]   He smiled viciously.
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:11.000]   "Neither course is clear," Fidole said, "though wisdom suggests we retreat. Are there any other options?"
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:15.000]   "We could fight now," Makin said.
[02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:21.000]   All eyes turned to him. The grizzled warrior looked at his hands, turning them over.
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:25.000]   Fidole beside him saw the calluses and scars.
[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:34.000]   "In the pit I have faced one foe, and I have faced many foes. It is always easier against one."
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:37.000]   I saw him fight four men and slay them all.
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:47.000]   "Against many, I strike fast, before they have a chance to join against me, and I strike hard to kill with one blow."
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:58.000]   "Aye, but this is no pit. This is Faun Forest, and our enemies are not lining up before us," Krelis growled.
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:06.000]   "They will be, if we allow them to. But one of them is close to us, cut off from the others.
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:15.000]   Gungl and the warband of Karnatan are out there, close, building a road, distracted, spread out with their backs to us.
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:24.000]   We'll likely fight him one day, though next time we see him, we'll probably be with half the realms of the Banished Lands at his back."
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:45.000]   "Whether we go to Drassil, or walk away, I say we have an opportunity here to even the odds a little. An opportunity would be fools to miss. And besides," he added, "there's nothing like a good fight to clear the mind."
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000]   Chapter 10
[02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:50.000]   Jail
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:57.000]   Jail stumbled, and almost fell, swearing under his breath as he reached out to grab a thick branch.
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:00.000]   "I hate this forest."
[02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:05.000]   He steadied himself, pausing to wipe sweat from his brow and catch a few breaths.
[02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:12.000]   His huntsman, Dag, was somewhere up ahead, setting a grueling pate as they marched through Faun Forest.
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:21.000]   "How many nights have we lived in this twilight nightmare? Twenty? Thirty? A hundred? Will it ever end?"
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:31.000]   A line of warriors was strung before and behind him, a few hundred men, the only survivors of his warband that had marched so proudly to the gates of Drassil.
[02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:43.000]   Thousand strong, the might of Iseltir now broken, slain, or scattered. And a third of those he fled with me have fallen since then to the forest and to its inhabitants.
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:53.000]   He shuddered at the memory of finding guards, gray and lifeless, their blood drained like juice from a ripe fruit, nothing much more left of them than skin and bone.
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:38:02.000]   How did it come to this? Victory was so close, Drassil almost mine. How did that boy defeat Sumur?
[02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:08.000]   He ground his teeth at the memory of Corbin taking the Kadashim's head in single combat.
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:14.000]   It had been a blow, he could not deny, and it had done little for the morale of Jael's warband.
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:21.000]   So Jael had ordered his finest warriors, his personal guard, to swarm Corbin and slay him.
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:33.000]   Sure, victory had seemed mere heartbeats away, but then the gates of Drassil had opened, that devil Wolfen and the stallion galloping out ahead of a host of giants and sword-waving lunatics.
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:36.000]   It had all gone downhill from there.
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:42.000]   That had been when Jael had made the decision to retreat. Retreat, not flee.
[02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:45.000]   A strategic withdrawal.
[02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:48.000]   Better to retreat and live to fight another day.
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:56.000]   And that is what I shall do here. Retreat to Iseltia, raise a fresh warband, fight to hold on to what I have achieved.
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:03.000]   "My lord," a voice said behind him. A sweat-soaked warrior was giving him a concerned frown.
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:07.000]   "What?" Jael snapped irritably.
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:13.000]   "The line, my king," the warrior said, jerking his head forwards.
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:19.000]   Jael realized the warriors he'd been following were still moving, disappearing into the foliage and shadows.
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:28.000]   Fear jolted him into movement. The thought of being stranded in the forest without Dag to guide him was a horror he had no wish to endure.
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:38.000]   He hastened on, limbs heavy and leaden, catching up with the men ahead. Then he was settling back into the monotonous march, his eyes fixed on the heels of the man in front of him.
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:42.000]   Whispering ahead caused Jael to look up from the ground.
[02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:48.000]   Dag was moving back down the line, patting a shoulder here, pausing to say a few words there.
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:52.000]   Never thought of him as leader material.
[02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:55.000]   For some reason the thought irritated Jael.
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000]   Always seemed like a loner.
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:01.000]   And those scars on his face don't make him more pleasant to be around.
[02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:04.000]   The huntsman eventually reached Jael.
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:11.000]   "You have news?" Jael asked, ashamed of the desperation and hope that he tried to keep from his voice.
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:17.000]   "Aye," Dag said. "There's men up ahead."
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:23.000]   Jael peered through dense undergrowth, for a moment struggling to understand what he was seeing.
[02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:27.000]   Only a dozen or so paces away, the undergrowth ended.
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:32.000]   A man-made clearing dotted with cut tree stumps led towards an embankment.
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:39.000]   Men, hundreds of them, were swarming over the embankment which stretched as far as he could see in both directions.
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:48.000]   They were working, many wielding long-handled axes and hammers were rising and falling, the rhythmic thud of their blows drumming through the forest.
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000]   They're building a road.
[02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:57.000]   It must be Lothar, or Gundal, still building to reach Drassil and win the race that I had already won.
[02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:08.000]   Just looking at the industriousness of what could only be his allies, even if they were also rivals in Jael's mind, he began to feel something of his old confidence returning.
[02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:13.000]   "I am safe. Safe from the forest. Safe from pursuit."
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:19.000]   "With me," he said to Dag, as he pushed his way through the undergrowth.
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:28.000]   He paused a moment, stood straighter and adjusted his tattered cloak, allowing his men to gather behind him, then marched across the clearing towards the embankment.
[02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:37.000]   The alarm was sounded when he was spotted, and warriors rapidly appeared clad in mail in brandishing swords and spears.
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:42.000]   Quirasses and banners bore the emblem of a burning torch upon a pale field.
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:46.000]   Gundal's warband, then. Excellent.
[02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:51.000]   He is far weaker than Lothar, and much easier to manipulate.
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:42:00.000]   Jael strode to a warrior standing amidst what was rapidly becoming a bristling hedge of sharp iron, already imagining that they were his warriors, his warband.
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:05.000]   "Take me to your king," Jael demanded imperiously.
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:10.000]   Jael paused for a moment on the road down which warriors of Carnatan were leading him.
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:18.000]   He'd walked a good half-league away from the forefront of this new road, built upon a fresh-piled embankment with the forest stripped back to either side.
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:22.000]   Wains were moving up and down the road, warriors lining it.
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:29.000]   Gundal's camp appeared, a sprawling mass to the south of the new road, at its center, a huge tent upon a low hill.
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:35.000]   "How many?" he whispered to Dag. He strode a step behind him.
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:39.000]   The rest of his tattered warband had been left at the side of the road.
[02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:47.000]   "Three four-thousand swords," the huntsman said with a shrug. "Hard to tell without the other hangers on."
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:55.000]   They weaved through the camp, a host of sounds and smells assailing Jael as he was guided through a maze of tents and cookfires.
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:43:01.000]   Cattle lowed from paddocks, the stink of human habitation wafting towards him.
[02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:08.000]   After being a refugee in this otherworldly and oppressive forest for so long, he felt almost overwhelmed by it.
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:16.000]   The tent Jael had spied from the road rose up before him, larger than it had at first appeared.
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:21.000]   His escort of a few score warriors led him purposefully towards it.
[02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:32.000]   Gundal. A circle of pale-skinned and black-eyed warriors stood guard about the tent, clothed in dark mail and leather, curved swords arching over their shoulders.
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:35.000]   "Nathare's Jiha."
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:39.000]   A score of them had marched with his own warband with Sumur as their captain.
[02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:45.000]   He remembered Sumur's skill in battle, the fury of the others as they had charged into battle.
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:52.000]   And the winged things that poured from them like poison when they fell, his skin crawled.
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:59.000]   Whatever they are, they are not men, but whatever they are, they still died, still failed me.
[02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:02.000]   So much for Nathare's great warriors.
[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:09.000]   He felt an irrational anger about that, even as he felt fear and revulsion crawling across his skin.
[02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:12.000]   He regarded the Jiha before him suspiciously.
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000]   "What are you?"
[02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:18.000]   "Respect them. Don't fear them," he reminded himself.
[02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:26.000]   "They die the same as the rest of us," Sumur fell to Corbin, and the rest no doubt during the battle before the gates of Drassil.
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:30.000]   A pair of warriors parted before Jael.
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:35.000]   One opened the tent flap and Jael entered, Dagg still a step behind.
[02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:42.000]   The tent was luxuriously furnished, thick furs carpeting the ground and gold-trimmed tapestries draping the walls.
[02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:47.000]   Perfumed candles burned, their scent thick and heavy in the air.
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:57.000]   Gundal was sitting on a wide-backed chair, one leg draped across the chair's arm, women clad in diaphanous silk, feeding him from various platters.
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:07.000]   A handful of young men lounged about him, their hair and beards slick and shining with oil, all of them were immaculately dressed in velvets and soft skins.
[02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:15.000]   "Look at them, fawning sycophants gathered about the pot of gold. Not a single one of them looks like they've held a blade in battle."
[02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:18.000]   Jael suppressed a sneer.
[02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:23.000]   "Well met, Gundal," he said as he strode forwards.
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:29.000]   Gundal studied him, a blank expression replaced slowly with recognition.
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:32.000]   He shifted in his chair but did not rise.
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:42.000]   "Well, if it isn't Jael of Iseltir," Gundal said, a flaccid smile spreading across his face.
[02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:47.000]   "King of Iseltir," Jael silently corrected as he returned a forced smile.
[02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:54.000]   "I did not recognize you," Gundal said, taking a long moment to look Jael up and down.
[02:45:54.000 --> 02:46:02.000]   Jael was abruptly aware of his appearance. When he rode to the gates of Drassil, he'd been dressed in his finest war gear.
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:10.000]   A coat of gleaming chainmail, sabled cloak trimmed with fur, britches, and boots of doe skin.
[02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:19.000]   Now his cloak was mud-crusted and in tatters, his chainmail smeared and rusting, his face and arms grimy and scratched beyond counting.
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:25.000]   "What a wonderful surprise," Gundal said with a barely disguised smirk.
[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:33.000]   "I had heard that you were lost, presumed dead after your defeat by the Ravel at Drassil. I rejoice that you live."
[02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:40.000]   "Then why do you look so disappointed? Already planning the annexation of my realm, I'd guess."
[02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:47.000]   Nothing made Jael angrier than thought of someone else stealing the realm he had so recently stolen for himself.
[02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:50.000]   He suppressed the urge to wrap his fingers around Gundal's throat.
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:56.000]   "If he thinks he can take Izeltir from me, I will make him eat his own intestines."
[02:46:56.000 --> 02:47:03.000]   "A sentiment I share, I can assure you," Jael said, strapping his smile upon his face.
[02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:14.000]   "The enemy at Drassil used fel magic against us. Alas, brave hearts and strong arms were not enough against the dark powers of Azeroth's black sun."
[02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:22.000]   "Really?" Gundal said, a more genuine smile twitching his lips. He sat straighter in his chair.
[02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:26.000]   "Nethair had little trouble against their fel magic."
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:29.000]   "What do you mean?" Jael asked.
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:35.000]   "King Nethair took Drassil over a ten night ago. The enemy are broken and scattered."
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000]   "What? The war is over?"
[02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:45.000]   "Well, from what I hear there is some resistance still but little more than the death throes of a foe that has not realized it's already lost."
[02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:49.000]   The war over and my own warband defeated.
[02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:57.000]   I had hoped for more time to return to Izeltir and raise a new warband, fresh battles and win some glory before the war was ended.
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000]   But now...
[02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:10.000]   "That is wonderful news," Jael said, speaking through a fixed grin. "I can see that your road building is going well. If I could ask one favor..."
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:16.000]   "What do you want?" Gundal asked, looking suddenly bored with the conversation.
[02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:20.000]   "He thinks me broken. A defeated rival of no consequence."
[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:23.000]   Jael stopped his teeth from grinding.
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:35.000]   "Horses for myself and my men. An escort back to Izeltir." "Your men?" Gundal sniffed, looking disdainfully at Dag who stood silently behind Jael.
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:39.000]   One of the young men gathered about Gundal sniggered.
[02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:44.000]   "Calm. Get what you need. Just remember the sycophant's face."
[02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:50.000]   "Yes, King Gundal," Jael said in his most comradely voice.
[02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:55.000]   "My warband are currently resting after their exertions."
[02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:58.000]   "How many?" Gundal frowned.
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:01.000]   "Around three hundred," Jael said.
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:08.000]   "I'm not sure that counts as a warband," Gundal smiled slyly and Jael's fingers twitched.
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:19.000]   "But even so, three hundred horses, I doubt I can spare so many. All my resources are going into building this road, you understand. I will reach Jassel before Lothar."
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:22.000]   So the race is still on.
[02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:27.000]   "Perhaps we can help each other then," Jael said.
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:34.000]   "How could you possibly help me?" Gundal sneered, looking pointedly at Jael's tattered appearance.
[02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:38.000]   Jael bid back a harsh response and stood straighter.
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:50.000]   "I am still the King of Iseltir. I could bring fresh workers to build your road. Two thousand at least. Maybe more."
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:57.000]   Gundal's smile broadened and he sat straight in his chair waving away the servants offering him platters of food.
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:01.000]   "You shall have your horses," he said.
[02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:08.000]   Jael opened his mouth to speak but paused. The faint sound of shouting was filtering through the tent's opening.
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:13.000]   Gundal heard it too and held his hand up to a man who was trying to whisper in his ear.
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:21.000]   The noises rapidly grew louder, shouts turning to screams, punctuated with the distinct sound of iron clashing.
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:28.000]   Jael glanced at Dag who stood poised like an animal on the edge of flight, one hand upon the hilt of his dagger.
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:32.000]   "We need to leave," the huntsman hissed to Jael.
[02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:39.000]   "What is that?" Gundal snapped, standing, fear and worry flickering across his features.
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:45.000]   "It is battle, something that I don't think you are fully acquainted with."
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:53.000]   Gundal strode from the tent, his gaggle of followers tight behind him. Jael and Dag slipped out after them.
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:51:01.000]   Outside, Gundal was stood on the slope of the hill staring with a look of confused disbelief towards the northern fringe of his camp.
[02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:08.000]   Warriors were pouring onto the road from its far side, cutting into the milling guards and workers.
[02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:15.000]   Jael saw resistance sluggishly forming, warriors from Gundal's warband attempting to form a defensive line across the road
[02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:20.000]   but before they could organize themselves they were locked in combat with their assailants.
[02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:28.000]   Within moments, the attackers had burst through the hastily formed resistance and were streaming down the embankment into the camp.
[02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:31.000]   "Asroth Stones, what now?"
[02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:37.000]   The Ge'ha on the hillside were drawing close about Gundal, black eyes staring.
[02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:40.000]   "We need to get out of here," Dag repeated.
[02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:46.000]   "What's going on?" Gundal cried, part temper, part hysteria.
[02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:54.000]   "It would appear you were right," Jael said, not able to keep the smirk from his face at the sound of terror in Gundal's voice
[02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:58.000]   even though he felt the coils of fear squirming in his own belly.
[02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:05.000]   "The enemy that you said did not know they were beaten, they appeared to be attacking you."
[02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:19.000]   McKean gazed through foliage at the sprawling camp, feeling his body tense and fingers twitch for his knife hilt
[02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:24.000]   as he watched Krelos' men appear on the road and engage Gundal's men.
[02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:30.000]   Crouched on the far south of the camp, he saw a few dozen enemy guards standing with their backs to him
[02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:34.000]   in an open space cleared between the camp and the treeline.
[02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:37.000]   They looked unsure of what to do.
[02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:42.000]   The man beside McKean gripped his sword and took a step forwards.
[02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:47.000]   "Wait," McKean whispered, seizing the warrior's arm.
[02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:51.000]   "Not till Krelos hits the camp."
[02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:58.000]   McKean had been given the command of a hundred men and they were spread loosely around him, hidden in the shadows and foliage.
[02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:03.000]   Only one thing had he said to them before they'd moved into position.
[02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:07.000]   "When I go, keep with me."
[02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:15.000]   Their task was to attack from the south and sweep up through the camp, spreading as much mayhem and panic along the way as was possible.
[02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:18.000]   McKean was unused to leading men.
[02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:25.000]   The Vinthalan fighting pits had honed his will to survive, teaching him that above all else, you fight for yourself.
[02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:32.000]   "But that is what Lycraes wanted. To break me. To strip away my loyalties. To make me less than human.
[02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:35.000]   I will not be that man again."
[02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:42.000]   The main attack was to be led by Krelos, his first objective to clear the new road of all resistance.
[02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:47.000]   It was there that their scouts had reported most of Gundal's warband were to be found.
[02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:53.000]   Once the road was clear, Krelos was to assault the camp, which was the signal for the others.
[02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:58.000]   McKean and Albin were leading smaller groups hidden to the west and south of the camp.
[02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:06.000]   The plan was to meet Krelos and his force at the command tent, situated on a hill close to the camp's center.
[02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:10.000]   At the thought of it, McKean's eyes drifted to the tent on the mound.
[02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:16.000]   Men were appearing from its entrance, standing and staring at the commotion that Krelos was causing.
[02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:19.000]   "Gundal. It must be."
[02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:23.000]   Two other men emerged from the tent, hanging back from the rest.
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:30.000]   One of them seemed... familiar in the way he walked, his posture, a confidence.
[02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:37.000]   Then, dark-clothed figures were appearing from around the hill, drawing tight about those who had emerged from the tent.
[02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:42.000]   Even from this distance, there was something clearly different about them.
[02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:49.000]   "Kadashim. Damn it. We're outnumbered as it is without those hell-spawned to complicate things."
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:55.000]   He shrugged at himself, knew they were committed now and there was no turning back.
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:55:02.000]   "And this whole attack was my idea, so I'd best be getting to that tent and making sure we win this thing."
[02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:08.000]   He looked back to the road and saw Krelos's warriors pouring down the embankment and into the camp.
[02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000]   "Good."
[02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:19.000]   With a battle cry, he exploded into motion, bursting from the treeline, drawing a knife in each hand as he sped towards the guard spread between him and the camp.
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:23.000]   A few paces behind him, his hundred followed.
[02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:29.000]   He heard a distant roar from the west, knew that Albin and his warriors were doing the same.
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:42.000]   McKean ducked a spear thrust and crashed into the man holding it, one of his knives punching through leather into flesh, ripping it free as his momentum carried him on, leaving the man on his knees, hands clutching at his belly.
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:51.000]   In moments, the guards along the camp's edge were either dead or fleeing, the sudden onslaught of McKean and his warriors too much for them.
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:56:01.000]   McKean gathered his warriors and charged into the camp, kicking at fires, smashing gates open, freeing cattle, hacking and slashing at anyone who got in their way.
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:11.000]   In heartbeats, flames were licking at tents and smoke was billowing. Stampeding cattle knocked men flying, the whole world seemed to dissolve into chaos.
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:26.000]   McKean turned a corner and almost ran into a dozen warriors, the ensuing combat savage and short, McKean's knives finding throats and arteries as he slipped through them like a violent wind, the men following him crashing upon those still standing.
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:41.000]   He sped through the camp, a knife dripping blood in each hand, leaving a trail of bodies in his wake. As he traveled deeper, any kind of resistance melted away. Those he came across ran from him and he was happy to let them go.
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:56.000]   For the most part, they were not Gundall's warriors but merchants, smiths, tanners, cobblers, drovers, whores and bairns. I may be a killer, but I'll not slay the innocent.
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:04.000]   Soon the initial red mist of battle began to fade and he glanced behind, saw the black and silver of Ripper's warriors following him.
[02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:14.000]   Not used to leading men these days or being in a fight this big. Mustn't forget they're with me. Mustn't forget the plan.
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:24.000]   Pausing, he gave his men a chance to gather behind him as he tried to get his bearings. Screams and the concussive clash of iron drifted down from the north.
[02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:35.000]   "Krellis sounds closer. Let's get to that command tent. Gundall must die for this to succeed. And to do that, we must carve away through his cadashim."
[02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:42.000]   He reached up to his shoulder and felt the hilt of a short sword, one of a pair strapped across his back.
[02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:47.000]   McKeen preferred using his knives, but taking heads from cadashim was sword work.
[02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:56.000]   He set off again. Close packed tents suddenly gave way to an open space, cook fires spread about it, tents forming a loose circle.
[02:57:56.000 --> 02:58:04.000]   Weapons racks were rowed along one edge. A mass of men were pulling spears from stands, strapping on helms, hefting shields.
[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:13.000]   McKeen skidded to a halt, realizing what he had stumbled upon. A barracks for the warriors of this warband.
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:22.000]   With a snarl, he ran at them. He hit a knot of men before they had any time to react, his knives tracing a red ruin across their bodies.
[02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:27.000]   In moments, he was through them and hurling himself at a new wall of men.
[02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:41.000]   Weapons thrusted him, but the battle rage was upon him, the world seeming to slow, and he twisted and flowed around every blow aimed at him, his knives licking out to sliced throats, puncture groins, cut hamstrings.
[02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:47.000]   Dimly, he heard the clash of arms behind him, knew his men were following.
[02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:54.000]   Faces appeared before him grim, fearful, shocked. All fell to his twin blades.
[02:58:54.000 --> 02:59:03.000]   His progress slowed. The men crammed together now, his ability to move and sway hindered by a crush of bodies.
[02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:11.000]   A quick glance showed his men behind him, fighting furiously, but they were outnumbered and the enemy was beginning to curl around their flanks.
[02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:19.000]   Surprise and savagery had taken them so far, but had not broken their foe. Things are about to get messy.
[02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:31.000]   McKeen stepped to the right, deflected a thrust aimed at the ribs of one of his men, slashed across the face of the attacker, kicked another in the knee, saw him buckle and stepped close to cut his throat.
[02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:40.000]   There was a great crash and a concussion that undulated through the hard-pressed warriors. Someone else joining this party.
[02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:51.000]   McKeen glimpsed a giant figure, Alcyon, wielding two woodsman's axes as McKeen was using his knives, carving away through the enemy like a scythe at harvest time.
[02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:56.000]   Heads and limbs flew through the air in great gouts of blood.
[02:59:56.000 --> 03:00:03.000]   Albin's crew. McKeen grinned and leapt at his enemy, new strength powering his muscles.
[03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:10.000]   Within moments, Gundal's warriors were wavering, a ripple of doubt and fear spreading through them and then they were fleeing.
[03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:17.000]   McKeen buried a knife in her back, ripped it free and stood over the collapsing figure, gore covered and breathing heavily.
[03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:26.000]   He saw Alcyon decapitate one more fleeing warrior, his wife Raina and their son Tain either side of him. Albin's warriors spread about them.
[03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:32.000]   "Well met?" a voice said, and McKeen turned to see Albin striding towards him.
[03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:37.000]   The old man was pale and had blood seeping from the bandage around his shoulder.
[03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:45.000]   I told him to stay at our camp. He'd have been better off there and I'd have been happier knowing someone of his skill was guarding Fidele.
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:55.000]   He felt a wave of fear for her, as he did every time that he was parted from her, but this was war. They both knew that she could not be here in the midst of this.
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:01:02.000]   "Well met," McKeen replied, sheathing a knife and gripping the old man's arm.
[03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:05.000]   He left blood-stained fingerprints.
[03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:08.000]   "Think you might have just saved my skin."
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:13.000]   Albin looked around at the bodies piled about McKeen and throughout the barrack ground.
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:16.000]   "I doubt that," he said.
[03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:21.000]   He glanced up through the rolling smoke at the hill that loomed not far away.
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:26.000]   "Gundel," McKeen said. "Aye, let's go and find him."
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:29.000]   Both of their warbands were about them now.
[03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:37.000]   "There's Kadashim on that hill," McKeen said loudly. "They don't die easily. Remember, you must take their heads."
[03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:41.000]   Albin and others nodded grimly.
[03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:45.000]   McKeen grinned at them, then ran for the hill.
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:55.000]   Clouds of smoke billowed about him, parted for a moment, and he saw the hill, the huge and gaudy tent upon it strangely out of place in the somber gloom of Faun.
[03:01:55.000 --> 03:02:05.000]   McKeen ran faster. The camp a place of flame and shadow, the thud of his comrades' feet behind him, screams and battle cries swirling on the eddying smoke.
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:13.000]   Then the ground began to rise and he burst from the haze and tents, Albin, Alcyon, and their men only a few paces behind him.
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:22.000]   Men were still on the hill, but they were retreating at least three score of the Kadashim that encircled them were herding them northeast towards the newest part of the road.
[03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:31.000]   "They're fleeing. Running for Drassil. And further along the road there'll be more reinforcements. Can't let them reach that road."
[03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:37.000]   McKeen sheathed his knives and drew the two short swords as he ran.
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:40.000]   The space between them narrowed quickly.
[03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:48.000]   McKeen and those with him were silent, no battle cries, only the drum of their feet and the jangle and creak of mail and leather.
[03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:54.000]   A properly, Gundall and the Kadashim were aware of them, Gundall yelling orders.
[03:02:54.000 --> 03:03:00.000]   A score of the Kadashim peeled away from the group, curved swords being drawn from behind their backs.
[03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:07.000]   One fixed its black eyes on McKeen and ran at him, a dark grin splitting its pallid face.
[03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:15.000]   McKeen felt a fist of fear squirm in his belly, remembering their ferocity and otherworldliness when he'd encountered them previously.
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:19.000]   He growled in anger at his own fear and ran faster.
[03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:36.000]   The first Kadashim almost took his head, its sword whistling a finger's width above him as he threw himself into a roll, coming to his feet behind the creature, his own strike at its neck blocked with blinding speed, his second blade slicing through the back of its leg as it spun to face him.
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:42.000]   McKeen leapt away, the creature stumbling as it tried to follow, its hamstrings cut.
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:47.000]   Even so, it was unnaturally fast, lurching after him.
[03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:52.000]   "It should be on the ground, not still trying to gut me."
[03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:56.000]   All around him, his warriors were locked in combat with the Kadashim.
[03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:59.000]   Battle cries and death screams rang out.
[03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:05.000]   He glimpsed Albin take a head, saw that terrible black vapor fill the air.
[03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:11.000]   His distraction nearly cosmic in his life as his attacker launched a combination of two-handed blows at him.
[03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:17.000]   He parried two and slipped inside the third, instinctively punching a shortsword into its belly.
[03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:25.000]   The Kadashim's mouth gaped wide, foul breath washing over him as its teeth snapped, trying to fasten on his throat.
[03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:40.000]   He headbutted it, pushed away, leaving one sword in its belly, his other blade whistling around to crunch into its collarbone, blood and bones spraying as he wrenched it free and hacked again, this time cutting deep into the creature's neck.
[03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:47.000]   He darted in, swerving away from its curved sword, chopping at its neck to finish the job.
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:51.000]   Somehow, the Kadashim's hand snaked out and caught his blade in its fist.
[03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:58.000]   A finger flew through the air, but still, it held on as it tried to bring its own sword round to bear.
[03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:04.000]   Makin grabbed its sword wrist, and for a few heartbeats, they lurched together in an ungainly dance.
[03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:10.000]   Within seconds, Bakin knew he could not win a contest of strength. The Kadashim's grip was unnaturally strong.
[03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:17.000]   Then, in the blink of an eye, its head was spinning through the air and Albin's face appeared before him.
[03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:26.000]   The Kadashim's body slumped, fists still gripped around Makin's sword blade, oily black smoke pouring from the open wound of its neck.
[03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:35.000]   A winged creature formed in the air above him and screamed wordless hatred at him. Then, the wind caught it, and it was gone.
[03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:40.000]   Makin sagged, Albin's hand reaching out to steady him.
[03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:48.000]   "There's no getting used to that," Makin breathed as he yanked his swords free of the creature's corpse.
[03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:55.000]   He looked around, saw more of the demon forms appearing in the air above them and then evaporating.
[03:05:55.000 --> 03:06:00.000]   At a glance, it seemed that most of those Kadashim that had attacked them had fallen,
[03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:06.000]   though many of Makin's and Albin's men were lying still and silent upon the ground.
[03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:12.000]   As Makin watched, Alcyon, Reiner, and Tain dispatched the last Kadashim.
[03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:16.000]   "Gundel?" Makin breathed.
[03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:20.000]   "Down there," Albin gestured.
[03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:27.000]   Makin saw the King of Karnatan disappearing amongst the tents, far more Kadashim still about him than Makin had hoped to see.
[03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:33.000]   Two men were moving with them. One of them paused as the others disappeared from view and looked back.
[03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:36.000]   For a moment, Makin's eyes locked with him.
[03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:40.000]   He staggered, felt as if he'd just been punched in the gut.
[03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:43.000]   "It cannot be."
[03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:48.000]   Makin's heart was suddenly pounding in his chest, a wave of shock spilling into fury.
[03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:53.000]   "Jael."
[03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:55.000]   Chapter 12
[03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:58.000]   Jael
[03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:02.000]   Jael stood and stared at the warriors on the hill.
[03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:10.000]   One man had emerged ahead of the others, blood-soaked and battle-grim, a short sword in each hand.
[03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:14.000]   He was staring back at Jael, and although they were a good hundred paces apart,
[03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:18.000]   Jael was certain he saw hatred twist the man's features.
[03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:22.000]   "There is something familiar about him."
[03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:29.000]   "My lord," Dag said, pulling at his sleeve, "we must keep moving."
[03:07:29.000 --> 03:07:34.000]   They were following the jihah that were shepherding Gundal and his retinue of lackeys to safety,
[03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:40.000]   hoping that the jihah would guard Jael and Dag as well as the others as they passed through the camp.
[03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:49.000]   Jael had heard the sounds of battle from the hilltop and paused to watch the bloody work of the handful of jihah warriors that had remained behind.
[03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:58.000]   They had fallen, but then it was a score against close to two hundred, and even so the jihah had decimated their enemy.
[03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:05.000]   As Jael stared, he saw the man burst into motion, running hard towards him, screaming Jael's name.
[03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:08.000]   "He knows me."
[03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:12.000]   Jael took an involuntary step back. "Doesn't seem to like me much, though."
[03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:17.000]   "Who?" Then he knew. "Makine."
[03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:23.000]   He had changed almost beyond all recognition, slimmer than Jael remembered him, his body chiseled,
[03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:31.000]   arms and legs a striated mass of muscle, face a place of ridges, scars, and hate-filled eyes.
[03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:39.000]   "How is he here?" "He should be dead, or at least a thousand leagues from here, and in shackles."
[03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:48.000]   Jael remembered the last time he had seen Makine, on the bridge at Dunkellen, chained and being dragged away by lycres to a Vinthalen slave ship.
[03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:54.000]   The fool had challenged me to the court of swords, insulted me in front of my men.
[03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:59.000]   From the look on Makine's face, that court of swords was still high on his agenda.
[03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:08.000]   Jael gulped. If Makine's expression did not convince him that it was time to go, the warriors charging down the hill behind Makine did.
[03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:11.000]   There were giants amongst them.
[03:09:11.000 --> 03:09:19.000]   This way, Dag snapped at him as they entered a maze of tents, banks of thick smoke rolling through it,
[03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:23.000]   the shouts and screams of battle drifting and swirling all about them.
[03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:29.000]   Footsteps drummed on the turf of the hill somewhere behind him and the Je'har were nowhere to be seen.
[03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:32.000]   Panic clenched a fist in his gut.
[03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:38.000]   "Jael!" a voice screamed behind him. "Keep running."
[03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:44.000]   Then he saw Dag, the huntsman moving fast, head dipped, scanning the ground.
[03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:50.000]   Jael followed him around a tent, ran down an empty isle of churned mud and barrels piled high,
[03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:55.000]   then turned again and saw the dark figures of the Je'har hurrying ahead of them.
[03:09:55.000 --> 03:10:02.000]   Relief swept him and he picked up his pace, he and Dag steadily catching up with Gundal and his protectors.
[03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:06.000]   They were close to the Je'har now, only a score of paces separating them.
[03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:10.000]   A final burst of speed and Jael was at their heels.
[03:10:10.000 --> 03:10:17.000]   He tried to shoulder his way between two of them and enter their protective circle but one turned and fixed him with its black, dead eyes.
[03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:24.000]   "Let me through," Jael gasped. "I am Jael, King of Iseult here. You must protect me."
[03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:29.000]   The Je'har warrior cocked its head at him, then it pushed Jael back, sending him stumbling.
[03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:32.000]   Dag reached out and steadied him.
[03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:34.000]   "Shouldn't have left my men on the roadside."
[03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:40.000]   "Neither. My. Men." Jael breathed to Dag.
[03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:46.000]   "Think this lot of going that way," Dag said. "Safer to travel with them."
[03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:49.000]   "Aye," Jael muttered.
[03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:54.000]   He saw Dag surreptitiously glance down corridors made by rows of tents.
[03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:59.000]   "He looks as if he's thinking of slinking off. Would probably do the same if I was him."
[03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:05.000]   "Gold!" Jael hacked out of his burning lungs. "I need this man."
[03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:06.000]   "What?"
[03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:14.000]   "Gold. For you. When you get me to Mikil. More than you can carry. More than you've ever dreamed of."
[03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:21.000]   "I've dreamed of a line of gold in my time," Dag said. "You've earned it!" Jael breathed.
[03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:24.000]   "Reckon I have," Dag muttered.
[03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:31.000]   A greedy smile crept across his face. "I'll get you to Mikil," the huntsman said.
[03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:39.000]   The sounds of battle suddenly grew louder. A knot of enemy warriors clothed in black and silver appeared ahead of them.
[03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:41.000]   They looked like Nathair's colors.
[03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:45.000]   Jael drew his sword as a warrior lurched before him.
[03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:51.000]   One of Gundal's men, his sword wildly parrying a flurry of blows from a warrior in black and silver.
[03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:54.000]   Jael stabbed his sword into the attacker's side.
[03:11:54.000 --> 03:12:02.000]   Ripping his sword free, he pushed the dying man away and leapt over him, eyes searching for Dag, his heart pounding desperately when he could not see him.
[03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:05.000]   "This way!" Dag called to him.
[03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:08.000]   Something slammed into Jael's back.
[03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:16.000]   He flew through the air, weightless for a moment, then hit the ground, air crushed from his lungs, and he was sliding in the mud, rolling.
[03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:26.000]   He came to a stop and rose to one knee, trying to ignore the pain in his chest and shoulder, hand grasping for his sword hilt, looking back to see a lunatic covered in blood rising from the ground.
[03:12:26.000 --> 03:12:28.000]   "Makine!"
[03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:32.000]   "Run!" Jael's mind screamed at him, but he knew he would not make it.
[03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:35.000]   Makine was too close for him to make a safe escape.
[03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:38.000]   Jael rose to his feet and hefted his sword.
[03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:49.000]   "I am the finest sword in Iseltir. I slew Castell in single combat and he was a great swordsman in his prime, not old and half-mad like this man before me."
[03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:53.000]   He set his feet and raised his blade.
[03:12:53.000 --> 03:13:03.000]   The world around him faded, the battle raging only a handful of strides away dimmed as a cold focus settled upon him, as it always did when he committed to the blade.
[03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:09.000]   "Come!" he shouted. "And I'll send you to meet Castell!"
[03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:15.000]   He thought to anger Makine, unbalance him with rage as angry men make mistakes.
[03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:19.000]   By the look on Makine's face his tactic worked.
[03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:24.000]   The man gripped his second blade and launched himself forwards, face twisted and snarl.
[03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:27.000]   "He's moving too fast."
[03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:34.000]   A smile twitched at Jael's lips as he stepped forwards to meet Makine, lunging as he did so, his sword tip aimed straight at Makine's heart.
[03:13:34.000 --> 03:13:39.000]   "His own speed will impale him, the idiot. He's a dead man."
[03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:46.000]   But then, Jael was stabbing into empty air, Makine no longer where he was supposed to be.
[03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:54.000]   A blow slammed into Jael's side, crunching into his ribs, white pain exploding in his chest as he dropped to one knee.
[03:13:54.000 --> 03:13:58.000]   The sudden urge to vomit almost consumed him.
[03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:05.000]   "He's broken my ribs," he realized in shock, his hand probing at his side, all the chainmail links bent and broken.
[03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:08.000]   "Move or die."
[03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:15.000]   Jael heaved himself to his feet, raised his sword and pivoted on his heel, but the expected blow never came at him.
[03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:19.000]   Instead, Makine was standing a few paces away, just staring at him.
[03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:27.000]   "I've waited a long time for this," Makine said, his voice as cold and hard as frosted iron.
[03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:31.000]   "Killing you quicks too good for you."
[03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:37.000]   A seed of fear blossomed in Jael's chest, the utter confidence in Makine's eyes chilling him.
[03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:49.000]   "Don't be a fool. I've watched him train on the weapons court. I know his strengths, his weaknesses, his old. Slow. I know I can beat him."
[03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:59.000]   "Kastel said something similar just before I bled him like a sow," Jael said, trying to keep the pain of his splintered ribs out of his voice.
[03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:03.000]   Makine came at him, slowly this time.
[03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:12.000]   Jael noticed knife hilts protruding from half a dozen places on Makine. Two on his belt, a shoulder strap, a hilt poking from a boot.
[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:21.000]   One of Makine's short swords trailed a lazy circle as the battle-scarred warrior rolled a wrist. Then, almost faster than Jael could follow, Makine was striking at him.
[03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:31.000]   Jael staggered backwards, pain from his ribs exploding with every breath and step as he blocked Makine's blows, each parry more ragged than the last.
[03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:35.000]   "He's as fast as the jihah. It's impossible. What's happened to him?"
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:51.000]   Panic threatened Jael now as a line of white fire ignited along one thigh when Makine cut him, moving too fast for him to defend against another wound appearing on his forearm, a slash across his forehead sending him tumbling backwards as blood sheeted into his eyes.
[03:15:51.000 --> 03:16:02.000]   Jael lay on his back, an arm wiping the blood from his eyes. Looking up, he saw grey sky veiled by the trees of fawn and then Makine appeared, looming over him.
[03:16:02.000 --> 03:16:10.000]   His face was latticed with scars, one ear mostly gone, just a lump of flesh remaining, his hair more grey than black.
[03:16:10.000 --> 03:16:26.000]   Jael searched the ground for the hilt of his sword, felt its worn leather and snatched at it. Makine's boot crunched into his ribs as the old warrior kicked him. Jael screamed, rolled over, vomited bile into the mud.
[03:16:26.000 --> 03:16:47.000]   "When you see Castel, be sure and tell him I kept my oath," Makine said above him. "This can't be happening. He's old." Jael rolled onto his back, arms raised, wanting to beg for mercy but he couldn't seem to get his lungs to work properly. Only a blubbering wheeze came from his gaping mouth.
[03:16:47.000 --> 03:17:01.000]   Makine raised one of his swords. Then there was a crunch and Makine was gone. He turned his head and saw Makine borne to the ground, grappling with another figure, small and wiry. "Dag, I love that man."
[03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:11.000]   Jael climbed to his knees, grabbed his sword and leavened himself to his feet, a wave of dizziness and nausea threatening him as his broken ribs complained.
[03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:19.000]   All around him men were fighting, the jihad seemingly reduced to a handful and more men in black and silver joining the battle.
[03:17:19.000 --> 03:17:25.000]   Gundell and his protectors were nowhere to be seen. "I need to get out of here."
[03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:32.000]   Makine and Dag were still fighting, Makine's short swords lying in the mud, a knife glinting in Dag's fist.
[03:17:32.000 --> 03:17:38.000]   Jael stumbled towards them, raised his sword, waiting for a clear thrust at Makine.
[03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:42.000]   A new battle cry rose up, this one deep and alien.
[03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:51.000]   The giant he had seen in Makine's company had appeared from out of the smoke and chaos, two more giants behind him as well as a knot of warriors in black and silver.
[03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:57.000]   The first giant saw him and bellowed, then charged at him, all those behind him following.
[03:17:57.000 --> 03:18:08.000]   Jael felt the ground tremble, he glanced down at Dag and Makine. "I need Makine dead and Dag alive. He is going to get me back to Iseltir."
[03:18:08.000 --> 03:18:16.000]   Jael looked back up at the onrushing giant and the swarm of sharp iron behind it. He turned and ran.
[03:18:25.000 --> 03:18:33.000]   Fidole paced around the cold ash of the fire pit. In the distance, she could hear the screams of battle and the clash of iron.
[03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:47.000]   "They say I am queen, that I must do my duty and lead the men of Tenebraal, yet they leave me here with a score of men guarded like a prisoner. To keep me safe. How is this leading?"
[03:18:47.000 --> 03:18:58.000]   She muttered a string of curses under her breath, some of the shieldmen left to guard her glanced at her. A smile twitched the mouth of one. "I should not be here."
[03:18:58.000 --> 03:19:09.000]   When Makine had suggested the attack on Gondor's camp, she had known instantly that it was the right thing to do and the thought of doing, of attacking instead of running, had its own heady appeal.
[03:19:09.000 --> 03:19:17.000]   Fidole had seen the others warm to the idea quickly and had felt a jolt of pride in Makine, seeing him listened to by the Lords of Ripa.
[03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:27.000]   Not that it had surprised her. She'd recognized something rare in Makine during their escape through Tenebraal, intelligence and strength and a lack of ego.
[03:19:27.000 --> 03:19:36.000]   He had the ability to look at a situation and know what had to be done, and then to do it with absolute commitment or die in the trying.
[03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:49.000]   More screams echoed through the forest, the din of battle ebbing and flowing, and she ground her teeth in frustration. "I will not be a bystander or a leader that does not lead."
[03:19:49.000 --> 03:20:01.000]   She brushed the knife hilt at her belt and strode away from the cold fire pit towards a rack of weapons, gripped a slim-shafted spear and hefted it, testing its weight.
[03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:10.000]   For a moment she was back in Tenebraal, in the forest with Makine, fighting her fear as she plunged a spear into the throat of a Vinthalen warrior.
[03:20:10.000 --> 03:20:24.000]   "My lady," one of the warriors said questioningly. "I am going to the battle," Fidole said. "What is that? Wise?" The warrior blinked.
[03:20:24.000 --> 03:20:37.000]   "My lady," he added. He was not young. By the look of him, he was a veteran of battle, a scar running through the red and silver of his beard, but unused to talking to queens, it appears.
[03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:40.000]   "What is your name?" she asked him.
[03:20:40.000 --> 03:20:48.000]   "Agost, my lady," he said. "Well, Agost, I am going to see how the battle fares."
[03:20:48.000 --> 03:20:56.000]   "But Albin is not my lord and does not command me," Fidole finished for him.
[03:20:56.000 --> 03:21:06.000]   "My people are out there, fighting. My place is with them. I have seen war and dark deeds," she continued, louder for all to hear.
[03:21:06.000 --> 03:21:13.000]   "I am no stranger to blood, and right now the men of Tenebraal are spilling theirs. I'll not stand hidden and await the outcome.
[03:21:13.000 --> 03:21:22.000]   Though we are few in number, we could still be needed at some hard-pressed moment. Battles have turned unless..."
[03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:32.000]   She looked around at their faces, saw the eagerness in their eyes, knew they did not want to be standing guard over her when their shield brothers were dying.
[03:21:32.000 --> 03:21:39.000]   With that, she gripped her spear like a staff and marched resolutely out of the camp.
[03:21:39.000 --> 03:21:48.000]   The sound of battle grew steadily louder as they moved through the forest, Agost and a few others slipping in front of her, a protective hand.
[03:21:48.000 --> 03:21:52.000]   Agost paused, held his hand up, and they stopped.
[03:21:52.000 --> 03:21:56.000]   "What?" Fidole whispered.
[03:21:56.000 --> 03:22:02.000]   "Someone's out there," Agost said, pointing deeper into the forest away from the sound of battle.
[03:22:02.000 --> 03:22:15.000]   He signaled and a handful of men followed him into the trees, disappearing into the shadows. For a hundred heartbeats, Fidole heard nothing, then, shouting, a clash of iron. Voices.
[03:22:15.000 --> 03:22:22.000]   "My lady," Agost's voice called, and Fidole stepped through the trees, the remainder of her guard about her.
[03:22:22.000 --> 03:22:29.000]   Agost and his warriors stood with three men, all clothed in leather and fur, beards braided and bound with leather.
[03:22:29.000 --> 03:22:34.000]   Axes hung at their belts, single-bladed and short-hafted.
[03:22:34.000 --> 03:22:39.000]   There was a hardness about these men that Fidole was used to seeing in veterans of battle.
[03:22:39.000 --> 03:22:43.000]   "Tell her what you told me," Agost said.
[03:22:43.000 --> 03:22:48.000]   "We come from Drassil," one said. "Send south in search of allies."
[03:22:48.000 --> 03:22:53.000]   "Allies for whom?" Fidole asked. "Who do you fight for?"
[03:22:53.000 --> 03:23:00.000]   "We fight for Corbin, the Bright Star," the three men said together.
[03:23:00.000 --> 03:23:04.000]   Chapter 14
[03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:07.000]   Makin
[03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:12.000]   Makin rolled in the dirt, grunting as his attacker butted him in the mouth.
[03:23:12.000 --> 03:23:18.000]   He spat blood into the man's face, butted him back, and felt the grip on his wrist loosen.
[03:23:18.000 --> 03:23:22.000]   Then he was rolling free, pulling a knife from his boot.
[03:23:22.000 --> 03:23:31.000]   The man facing him climbed to his feet. He was small, lean, with wiry muscle, face a burn-scarred mess.
[03:23:31.000 --> 03:23:34.000]   "We have much in common."
[03:23:34.000 --> 03:23:40.000]   "Whatever he promised you, JL's not worth it," Makin growled.
[03:23:40.000 --> 03:23:47.000]   "Gold's always worth it," the man snarled back, pulling a knife of his own from a sheath at his back.
[03:23:47.000 --> 03:23:57.000]   Makin lunged in, their blades clashing, sparking, Makin ducking a hooked punch, pivoting away, swaying back in close, knife stabbing for his enemy's throat.
[03:23:57.000 --> 03:24:06.000]   He was blocked, the man backing away. They parted and circled, Makin crouched and circling like a stalking wolf.
[03:24:06.000 --> 03:24:17.000]   A bellowing roar rang out. Makin's eyes were drawn to the battle about them. Alcian was there, hacking with his two woodsman's axes at a Karashim that was standing over another giant figure.
[03:24:17.000 --> 03:24:19.000]   "Alcian's son?"
[03:24:19.000 --> 03:24:25.000]   The Karashim's head arced through the air, black mist hissing from the collapsing corpse.
[03:24:25.000 --> 03:24:29.000]   A scuffing of earth drew Makin back to his enemy.
[03:24:29.000 --> 03:24:41.000]   He swayed left, avoided a knife in the eye, kicked out, his foot connecting with a knee, heard cartilage crunch, then Makin was in close, plunging his knife into his enemy's belly.
[03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:46.000]   He twisted the blade, ripped it free, and shoved the slumping figure away.
[03:24:46.000 --> 03:24:52.000]   "Can't take gold where you're going," Makin grunted at the dying man.
[03:24:52.000 --> 03:24:56.000]   He didn't answer, eyes already glazing and vacant.
[03:24:56.000 --> 03:25:06.000]   The battle around him was all but done, the Karashim that had fallen back from Gundal's honor guard all slain, though many men had fallen to their blades.
[03:25:06.000 --> 03:25:14.000]   A scattering of Gundal's other warriors were still fighting against the black and silver of Krelis' men, but they were all but broken.
[03:25:14.000 --> 03:25:21.000]   Makin stared into the distance, searching for Jael, but I know the direction he was running.
[03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:30.000]   His eyes lifted over the tents to look towards the road and embankment that cut into Faun Forest. Fastest way out of here.
[03:25:30.000 --> 03:25:39.000]   Alsion and Raynar were lifting their son from the ground. Makin approached them, retrieving his short swords as he did so.
[03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:45.000]   The giantling was loose-limbed, a cut on his temple's swelling, but other than that he looked well enough.
[03:25:45.000 --> 03:25:52.000]   "He'll live," Makin said. "Then my thanks for following me."
[03:25:52.000 --> 03:26:01.000]   The giant shrugged. "Raynar has spoken to me of you, of what you did for her and Tain."
[03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:11.000]   Makin didn't know what to say about that. He looked beyond the giant, saw a scattering of the warriors who had been put under his command, realized that the sight of Jael had driven all else from his mind.
[03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:19.000]   "Albin?" he asked. "On the hill, waiting for Krelis," the giant said.
[03:26:19.000 --> 03:26:27.000]   "I'm here," a voice called, Krelis emerging from an aisle between tents. He was blood-soaked and grinning.
[03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:32.000]   "Remind me to listen to you next time you say you have a plan," he said to Makin.
[03:26:32.000 --> 03:26:36.000]   "The plan's not done until Gundal's dead," Makin said.
[03:26:36.000 --> 03:26:43.000]   "Aye, where is that little snot-nosed arse-ling? Albin got him trussed up on the hill."
[03:26:43.000 --> 03:26:48.000]   "No," Makin grunted. "He's fled with a few-score kadashim about him."
[03:26:48.000 --> 03:26:51.000]   "That way," he pointed.
[03:26:51.000 --> 03:26:56.000]   "Well, what we doing standing here flapping our jaws, then?"
[03:26:56.000 --> 03:26:59.000]   "Just what I was thinking."
[03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:04.000]   Krelis tugged on his beard, eyes narrowing as he looked the way Gundal had fled.
[03:27:04.000 --> 03:27:09.000]   "Best go and tell Albin to follow us," Krelis said to Makin.
[03:27:09.000 --> 03:27:13.000]   "We'll need all the swords we can muster against those damn kadashim."
[03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:17.000]   "Send someone else," Makin said as he strode away.
[03:27:17.000 --> 03:27:20.000]   "I'm going after Gundal."
[03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:24.000]   "And Jael."
[03:27:24.000 --> 03:27:26.000]   Chapter 15
[03:27:26.000 --> 03:27:29.000]   Veridis
[03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:37.000]   "Shield wall!" Veridis shouted, lifting his borrowed shield and expecting those either side of him to lock into place.
[03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:43.000]   There was a sporadic thudding as shields came up, lacking the controlled discipline that he was used to.
[03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:51.000]   "These men are not my draeg's teeth, not veterans of a score of battles in the shield wall," he bit back a curse.
[03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:54.000]   "I am lucky they are here at all."
[03:27:54.000 --> 03:28:01.000]   When Veridis had spoken of using the shield wall to clear the road, Krelis had curled a lip in disgust.
[03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:07.000]   Veridis' brother had never liked the idea of men fighting in such a way. To him, it lacked honor.
[03:28:07.000 --> 03:28:10.000]   "It works and it will save lives."
[03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:15.000]   Even as Veridis had said the words, he'd heard Nathanr's voice echoing them in his mind.
[03:28:15.000 --> 03:28:23.000]   "Your task is to keep the road clear and then to hold it," Albin had said, stepping in between the two brothers.
[03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:32.000]   "How you do it is your decision, Veridis. Only guard our backs and stop the reinforcements that will surely come from further along the road."
[03:28:32.000 --> 03:28:35.000]   Krelis had said no more, and so the plan had proceeded.
[03:28:35.000 --> 03:28:40.000]   Krelis attacking the road from the north, Albin and McKeen spearheading two smaller groups into the camp,
[03:28:40.000 --> 03:28:49.000]   Veridis and his reserve group holding the road as Krelis moved on to the main camp and guarding against the counterattack that would inevitably come.
[03:28:49.000 --> 03:29:00.000]   So far, it had all gone remarkably smoothly, the enemy breaking and scattering, surprise and ferocity shattering any resistance before it had a chance to form fully.
[03:29:00.000 --> 03:29:06.000]   It's amazing what a small and focused force can do against a larger, unprepared one.
[03:29:06.000 --> 03:29:14.000]   He took a deep breath, knew that a battle was close, tried to calm the anger he felt bubbling away inside his chest.
[03:29:14.000 --> 03:29:24.000]   That was his overwhelming emotion right now, anger. He was angry with Callidus for the web of lies and deception he had woven and for what he had done to Nefair,
[03:29:24.000 --> 03:29:28.000]   but that was nothing besides the anger he felt for his old friend.
[03:29:28.000 --> 03:29:37.000]   "Nefair, how could you believe Callidus? Why did you not resist or come to me sooner? We could have stood against Callidus together."
[03:29:37.000 --> 03:29:52.000]   And most of all, he was angry with himself. "I am a fool. How did I not see it all happening about me? Veridis the loyal. Veridis the trustworthy. Veridis the blind idiot, I say."
[03:29:52.000 --> 03:29:57.000]   "Calm yourself. Focus. You have a battle to fight."
[03:29:57.000 --> 03:30:05.000]   He had gathered his 200 on the embankment to the northeast of the camp at the point where the road left the camp behind and ploughed into the forest.
[03:30:05.000 --> 03:30:13.000]   From this vantage point, Veridis had watched Krelis, Albin and Makin flood through the camp with their small bands of men.
[03:30:13.000 --> 03:30:22.000]   Fires and great clouds of smoke marked their paths as they moved ever deeper, inexorably towards the hill with Gundal's command tent on it.
[03:30:22.000 --> 03:30:29.000]   He'd seen movement on the hill, what looked like combat, though it was hard to discern any details because of the distance.
[03:30:29.000 --> 03:30:37.000]   Now the flames and smoke were so dense that it was hard to see anything at all, but Veridis' attention was needed elsewhere anyway.
[03:30:37.000 --> 03:30:42.000]   To his left, in a depth of fawn, men were approaching along the road.
[03:30:42.000 --> 03:30:50.000]   Veridis saw a knot of warriors in mail and leather at the front and center of a much larger hoard that spilt down the embankments to either side.
[03:30:50.000 --> 03:30:53.000]   At least a thousand strong.
[03:30:53.000 --> 03:30:57.000]   Finally, the shields either side of Veridis locked into his.
[03:30:57.000 --> 03:31:09.000]   He felt the urge to order the march, knew that the shield wall moving towards a larger foe had always caused hesitation and sown seeds of fear in the enemy, but he was uncertain of the men about him.
[03:31:09.000 --> 03:31:14.000]   Just getting into formation on the road and forming the shield wall, they seemed to tax them.
[03:31:14.000 --> 03:31:16.000]   He glanced at the warrior to his right.
[03:31:16.000 --> 03:31:19.000]   "A young man?" his beard a straggly thing.
[03:31:19.000 --> 03:31:22.000]   "Young? I know him!"
[03:31:22.000 --> 03:31:24.000]   "It is Balan."
[03:31:24.000 --> 03:31:29.000]   "He is only a few years younger than I. We used to spar together."
[03:31:29.000 --> 03:31:36.000]   But Veridis felt older than his years, knew that his travels and experience in the shield wall set him apart from most of those about him.
[03:31:36.000 --> 03:31:44.000]   "I cannot expect too much from them yet. They only know this much because an affair ordered that all men of Tenebra were drilled in the shield wall."
[03:31:44.000 --> 03:31:58.000]   "It will have to do," Veridis thought. "Marching may be a step too far. We'll wait here for them. We fill the road and block the path to the camp so they'll have to cut us down and march through us to get Acrellas's flank."
[03:31:58.000 --> 03:32:09.000]   Looking at the men around him, earnest brave men a thousand leagues from home, he felt some of his anger drain, replaced with sympathy and a deep sense of responsibility for them.
[03:32:09.000 --> 03:32:18.000]   "Balan, listen to me," Veridis said to the warrior beside him. The man returned his gaze and Veridis saw fear in his eyes.
[03:32:18.000 --> 03:32:23.000]   "Follow my orders and we'll come through this."
[03:32:23.000 --> 03:32:26.000]   The warrior nodded at him, then looked away.
[03:32:26.000 --> 03:32:30.000]   Shouts and challenges grew louder as the enemy came closer.
[03:32:30.000 --> 03:32:43.000]   "If they get past us, our kin and sword brothers die!" Veridis yelled, feeling the blood begin to surge through his veins, fear and excitement merging into the exhilaration that he always felt before battle.
[03:32:43.000 --> 03:32:48.000]   "Remember your oaths and fight for your sword brother beside you!"
[03:32:48.000 --> 03:32:51.000]   He felt Balan stand straighter alongside him.
[03:32:51.000 --> 03:33:00.000]   They were inexperienced, but to the warband of Gundal that was approaching him the shield wall was like nothing they had ever seen before.
[03:33:00.000 --> 03:33:08.000]   Veridis saw the front ranks of the enemy slow, close enough now to see looks of confusion and worry upon their faces.
[03:33:08.000 --> 03:33:12.000]   Warriors were a superstitious bunch, always wary of the unknown.
[03:33:12.000 --> 03:33:17.000]   "Sords!" Veridis shouted, drawing the short blade at his hip.
[03:33:17.000 --> 03:33:22.000]   About and behind him he heard the hiss of iron leaving leather.
[03:33:22.000 --> 03:33:33.000]   He began to thump his hilt upon the wooden boards of his shield, the rhythmic pounding taken up first by those about him, then spreading, rippling through the deep wall of two hundred men.
[03:33:33.000 --> 03:33:41.000]   He saw its effects upon those approaching, warriors hesitating in their steps, uncertainty spreading like a mist.
[03:33:41.000 --> 03:33:48.000]   Then one warrior stepped from the crowd, a big man clad in mail, a helm of iron, his sword raised high.
[03:33:48.000 --> 03:33:52.000]   He bellowed a wordless challenge and ran at Veridis' wall of shields.
[03:33:52.000 --> 03:34:01.000]   A trickle of men followed him, warriors from the center, then others, warriors, woodsmen and laborers from the flanks, all screaming blood and murder.
[03:34:01.000 --> 03:34:07.000]   "Ready!" Veridis roared, spreading his feet and leaning forwards into his shield.
[03:34:07.000 --> 03:34:15.000]   A thread of fear clenched in his belly as it always did in this moment when battle was inevitable but not yet joined.
[03:34:15.000 --> 03:34:25.000]   Then men were crashing into his shield, blows raining upon it, shuddering through his wrist and arm into his shoulder, numbing muscle and sinew.
[03:34:25.000 --> 03:34:27.000]   And the fear was gone.
[03:34:27.000 --> 03:34:37.000]   A face appeared above his shield rim, snarling at him. "Now!" Veridis bellowed, stabbing his short sword through the thin gap between his shield and balance.
[03:34:37.000 --> 03:34:41.000]   To either side, warriors doing the same.
[03:34:41.000 --> 03:34:46.000]   He felt his blade bite into flesh, drew it back red, stabbed again.
[03:34:46.000 --> 03:35:02.000]   The face above his shield rim disappeared, replaced by another. He stabbed again, felt his blade turn on mail, drew it back and stabbed lower, heard a scream, kept stabbing, not frantically as Balan was doing beside him, but steady, a rhythm to it.
[03:35:02.000 --> 03:35:07.000]   "Easy!" Veridis barked at Balan. "They're not going anywhere!"
[03:35:07.000 --> 03:35:14.000]   Balan shot him a glance, eyes wide and white, but his blade work became less frantic.
[03:35:14.000 --> 03:35:25.000]   Men fell, blood sluicing down Veridis' blade, soaking his hand, muscles burning, the unrelenting thud of blows against his shield pushing his straining body to its limits.
[03:35:25.000 --> 03:35:37.000]   Sinew screamed against the constant pressure as men piled against the shield wall, some throwing themselves, others crushed by the oncoming mass behind them like the sea against a tidal wall.
[03:35:37.000 --> 03:35:46.000]   Fingers grabbed at the rim of Veridis' shield, pulling it down, and Veridis saw a woodsman, caught a glimpse of the road and forest behind him.
[03:35:46.000 --> 03:35:51.000]   Veridis chopped, another scream as fingers flew through the air.
[03:35:51.000 --> 03:36:00.000]   The constant pressure was easing, still the thud of weapons as men hammered at the wall, but the unrelenting press of bodies was gone.
[03:36:00.000 --> 03:36:10.000]   "The end is coming," Veridis recognized, when the initial rush of that first battle fury was spent and men looked about at the carnage reaped by the shield wall.
[03:36:10.000 --> 03:36:20.000]   He had seen it before, knew that the ground would be piled with the dead, warrior spirits crushed by the shield wall's faceless brutality.
[03:36:20.000 --> 03:36:24.000]   "We must strike now and break them!"
[03:36:24.000 --> 03:36:33.000]   "Forwards!" Veridis cried. He punched Balan to his right to get his attention, yelled his command again, and took a step forwards.
[03:36:33.000 --> 03:36:40.000]   For a moment, he thought he was alone, stepping out of the wall into certain death, but then Balan followed him.
[03:36:40.000 --> 03:36:49.000]   A heartbeat later, the man on his either side doing the same, and with a stutter, the front row of the shield wall took one shambling step forwards.
[03:36:49.000 --> 03:36:57.000]   Veridis stumbled on a body underfoot, but managed to stay upright, even though the ground was slit with blood and snared with limbs.
[03:36:57.000 --> 03:37:06.000]   He felt the line sway, thought that the wall would splinter, break, and be scattered, but then it steadied.
[03:37:06.000 --> 03:37:10.000]   Veridis felt the strength and solidity return.
[03:37:10.000 --> 03:37:18.000]   He set his feet and stabbed through the gap in the shields, felt his sword pierce flesh, heard more screams as others did the same.
[03:37:18.000 --> 03:37:22.000]   "It's working. Forwards!" Veridis yelled again.
[03:37:22.000 --> 03:37:30.000]   I did not wait this time to take another step. The shield wall shuddered forwards, swords snaked out, more men falling, dying.
[03:37:30.000 --> 03:37:36.000]   "March!" Veridis shouted, his voice hoarse and dry.
[03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:47.000]   Bagging his sword against his shield to set time, he felt the whole shield wall move with him, some of the men behind him thudding their swords against shields in time with him, the front row still stabbing as they marched.
[03:37:47.000 --> 03:38:08.000]   They were a ragged mass compared to the disciplined ranks that Veridis was accustomed to leading, but still he grinned with the joy of it as his enemy fell before him, felt as if they were unbeatable, unstoppable, and then the pressure before them was gone, the sound of feet drumming on the road as men turned and ran before them.
[03:38:08.000 --> 03:38:15.000]   Veridis called a halt. The wall stumbled to a ragged stop, and Veridis lowered his shield.
[03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:23.000]   Bodies lay strewn everywhere. Trees loomed before them, the camp ablaze behind.
[03:38:23.000 --> 03:38:32.000]   Dim figures could be seen fleeing along the road, some escaping into the gloom of the forest either side of the road. Not enough to challenge us again.
[03:38:32.000 --> 03:38:35.000]   Relief flooded through him.
[03:38:35.000 --> 03:38:37.000]   "They are broken."
[03:38:37.000 --> 03:38:39.000]   "We've won."
[03:38:39.000 --> 03:38:46.000]   They had all known that the greatest threat would come from the warriors and workers who were away from the camp, spread along the road.
[03:38:46.000 --> 03:38:56.000]   They were the ones who would be alerted to the attack, would be able to gather their courage and attack, unlike all those within the camp who would be caught by surprise.
[03:38:56.000 --> 03:39:06.000]   He looked, and saw Balan grinning. The recognition of survival, the joy of victory, saw the same expression spreading amongst those about him.
[03:39:06.000 --> 03:39:16.000]   Then, voices yelled a warning. Death screams rang out. Veridis spun around, searching for the new danger. It came from behind.
[03:39:16.000 --> 03:39:24.000]   Figures were emerging from the camp, a solid mass of warriors appearing dressed in black mail, curved swords in their hands.
[03:39:24.000 --> 03:39:26.000]   "Kadashim."
[03:39:26.000 --> 03:39:37.000]   They were running up the embankment, carving into the flank and rear of Veridis's shield wall, twenty, forty, sixty of them, more appearing from amongst the tents as well as a tight knot of others behind them.
[03:39:37.000 --> 03:39:38.000]   "Gundul."
[03:39:38.000 --> 03:39:40.000]   "And his honor guard."
[03:39:40.000 --> 03:39:43.000]   "He cannot get away."
[03:39:43.000 --> 03:39:52.000]   Veridis began moving towards the Kadashim. Even as his mouth opened to shout for the wall to reform, he knew it would not defeat these demons spawn.
[03:39:52.000 --> 03:39:58.000]   "We have to take their heads, and the wall will not help us do that."
[03:39:58.000 --> 03:40:11.000]   He saw men crunching shields together, falling back on the strategy that had just served them so well, but a handful of Kadashim leapt at the hastily formed wall, ripped it apart with savage fury, swords rising and falling and deadly arcs.
[03:40:11.000 --> 03:40:23.000]   "My men are dying. The Kadashim are slaughtering my men." Veridis broke into a run and hurled himself at the Kadashim.
[03:40:23.000 --> 03:40:28.000]   Chapter 16 - Jael
[03:40:28.000 --> 03:40:46.000]   Jael ran through the camp with every jarring step, every wheezing breath, trying to somehow lessen the pain of his broken ribs, though that doesn't seem to be working. Blood was still leaking into his eyes from a wound on his forehead, and Maqeen's sword cut on his leg and forearm burned as if he'd been branded.
[03:40:46.000 --> 03:40:50.000]   He took me by surprise, before I was ready.
[03:40:50.000 --> 03:41:01.000]   He risked a look over his shoulder, relieved to see that there was no lunatic armed to the brim with knives chasing after him. In fact, no one was in sight, before or behind.
[03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:09.000]   It felt as if he was alone in a world of white tents and narrow aisles, of smoke and fire and distant screams.
[03:41:09.000 --> 03:41:19.000]   The last he'd seen of Maqeen had been rolling in the dirt with a dag. He looked like a man with a serious grudge, and I really could do without that right now.
[03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:30.000]   Could be that Dag has killed Maqeen. Much as he wanted to believe it, he wasn't convinced. The ease with which Maqeen had shattered his ribs had shocked Jael.
[03:41:30.000 --> 03:41:36.000]   How did he move so fast? It must have been a lucky blow. He's old and broken.
[03:41:36.000 --> 03:41:46.000]   He heard screaming off to his left and so veered right, taking a new path through abandoned tents and cook fires. No more battle if I can help it.
[03:41:46.000 --> 03:41:53.000]   Ahead of him, the trees of Faun loomed, overlooking the fringes of the camp like a tribe of dour ogres.
[03:41:53.000 --> 03:41:59.000]   Nearly out of this hellhole. Even if Maqeen still breathes, he'll never find me now. I just have to find my men.
[03:41:59.000 --> 03:42:06.000]   Three hundred swords waiting for me, half a league along Gundal's cursed road.
[03:42:06.000 --> 03:42:17.000]   The McClammer of Battle drifted down to Jael. He was travelling straight towards it. He didn't turn away this time, though, as it was exactly where he needed to go.
[03:42:17.000 --> 03:42:24.000]   My men are out there somewhere, and if I'm going to get out of Faun alive, I will need them about me.
[03:42:24.000 --> 03:42:28.000]   So Jael gritted his teeth and ran on.
[03:42:28.000 --> 03:42:41.000]   He emerged from the tent into a scene of carnage. Warriors were massed upon the road, more of the enemy in the black and silver of Tenebrau, but to Jael's pleasant surprise, the jihah were loose amongst them.
[03:42:41.000 --> 03:42:50.000]   The road was a heaving mass of battle, the path into the forest blocked for the moment, but the jihah were doing all that they could about that.
[03:42:50.000 --> 03:42:57.000]   Even as Jael watched, he saw one of the jihah lift a warrior into the air and hurl him down the embankment.
[03:42:57.000 --> 03:43:03.000]   He might be able to sneak through in the chaos, he thought, and began to climb. Then he saw Gundal.
[03:43:03.000 --> 03:43:12.000]   The young king of Carnatan was standing upon the road. Separate from the battle, his sycophants huddled about him, though their numbers looked somewhat thinned.
[03:43:12.000 --> 03:43:21.000]   About them were a dozen or so jihah warriors, the rest of Gundal's honour guard trying to carve a way through the wall of flesh and bone that barred the way to escape.
[03:43:21.000 --> 03:43:25.000]   From what Jael could see, they were doing a good job of it.
[03:43:25.000 --> 03:43:29.000]   Stick with Gundal or try and sneak past?
[03:43:29.000 --> 03:43:41.000]   A warrior in black and silver flew through the air a hand span from Jael, struck the ground and rolled bonelessly down the embankment, crashing into a tent and bringing it down around him.
[03:43:41.000 --> 03:43:49.000]   Jael reached the road and tried to skirt the combat which had broken down into a series of scattered and brutal skirmishes.
[03:43:49.000 --> 03:43:59.000]   The enemy looked to be rallying against the jihah, one man leading a charge that sent two of those disturbing black mists jetting into the air.
[03:43:59.000 --> 03:44:04.000]   "Break, damn you," Jael muttered at the enemy. "Don't rally."
[03:44:04.000 --> 03:44:11.000]   "Jael," a voice called. And for a terrifying moment, Jael thought it was McKeen.
[03:44:11.000 --> 03:44:16.000]   His head jerked around to see Gundal waving wildly to him from the midst of his protectors.
[03:44:16.000 --> 03:44:19.000]   "Over here," Gundal beckoned to him.
[03:44:19.000 --> 03:44:26.000]   For a moment, Jael considered his options and quickly concluded that he was safer within a ring of jihah warriors.
[03:44:26.000 --> 03:44:31.000]   He hobbled over to Gundal and Jael stepping out of the way to let him through.
[03:44:31.000 --> 03:44:37.000]   "I'm glad you're still alive," Gundal said. "300 men, you say? Where are they?"
[03:44:37.000 --> 03:44:46.000]   For a moment, Jael didn't understand what Gundal was talking about. Then he realized he was referring to Jael's men, left waiting further along the road.
[03:44:46.000 --> 03:44:48.000]   "Not a complete idiot, then."
[03:44:48.000 --> 03:44:54.000]   "That way," Jael pointed over the combat before them into the dark tunnel of the road.
[03:44:54.000 --> 03:45:01.000]   "Good. Drassil is that way too. And a few hundred more swords around me would be a good thing."
[03:45:01.000 --> 03:45:08.000]   He looked back at his camp, at the flames and the black clouds of smoke at the dead scattered all around.
[03:45:08.000 --> 03:45:16.000]   "Look what they've done," Gundal wailed, face twisting in misery. "They've destroyed my camp, crushed my warband."
[03:45:16.000 --> 03:45:21.000]   "Must hope they don't do it to you too, you whining little worm. And more importantly, not to me."
[03:45:21.000 --> 03:45:27.000]   "We need to move," Jael muttered, not liking the feeling of standing still.
[03:45:27.000 --> 03:45:33.000]   The knowledge that Makin was out there somewhere, hunting him, hovered at the back of his mind like a black cloud.
[03:45:33.000 --> 03:45:37.000]   "Yes. Onwards!" Gundal yelled.
[03:45:37.000 --> 03:45:44.000]   A Jeha warrior turned its black eyes upon Gundal, then with a shrug began to lead their small group along the road.
[03:45:44.000 --> 03:45:52.000]   The other Jeha, a dozen left with Gundal at best, fanned out in a tight half circle, pushing into the fringes of battle.
[03:45:52.000 --> 03:46:00.000]   Then something crashed into their group from the left, sending men tumbling, Jeha reeling, turning to face this new attack.
[03:46:00.000 --> 03:46:06.000]   Jael staggered into one of Gundal's followers, shoving the man to the ground as he righted himself.
[03:46:06.000 --> 03:46:13.000]   They'd been attacked by a knot of warriors in black and silver, charged and rammed by them, all with shields raised and interlocked.
[03:46:13.000 --> 03:46:18.000]   Even as he looked, short swords darted out from the small wall of shields.
[03:46:18.000 --> 03:46:23.000]   Two of Gundal's followers were caught in the attack and fell, pierced many times.
[03:46:23.000 --> 03:46:27.000]   Gundal was shrieking, waving his sword around ineffectually.
[03:46:27.000 --> 03:46:40.000]   Jael saw blades sink into the flesh of a Jeha, but it shrugged off the blows and grabbed a shield rim, dragging the warrior behind it forwards and chopping into his neck, sending him crashing to the ground in a spray of blood.
[03:46:40.000 --> 03:46:48.000]   The small shield wall fractured, men breaking away and attacking Gundal's party the old way, man to man.
[03:46:48.000 --> 03:46:52.000]   Not a wise choice against the Jeha.
[03:46:52.000 --> 03:46:57.000]   Jael backed away, put a few of Gundal's followers between him and this new attack.
[03:46:57.000 --> 03:47:00.000]   "I'm scared of no man, but..."
[03:47:00.000 --> 03:47:06.000]   He put a hand to his throbbing ribs, glanced down at the blood crusting his thigh.
[03:47:06.000 --> 03:47:21.000]   Another warrior came at the first Jeha, this man in a black and silver commander's cuirass, using sword and shield together to push the creature back a pace, sword darting out to stab at its thigh, shield boss punching into the Jeha's face.
[03:47:21.000 --> 03:47:24.000]   There was something familiar about the warrior.
[03:47:24.000 --> 03:47:27.000]   "I know him."
[03:47:27.000 --> 03:47:32.000]   The Jeha staggered back a few steps, black blood dripping from its broken nose.
[03:47:32.000 --> 03:47:43.000]   Its face twisted in a snarl as it launched itself forwards, shoulder ramming into the warrior, sending him stumbling backwards, tripping over a corpse and falling hard.
[03:47:43.000 --> 03:47:52.000]   The Jeha stood over him, curved sword rising, then another figure was there plunging a spear into the Jeha's throat.
[03:47:52.000 --> 03:47:54.000]   A woman.
[03:47:54.000 --> 03:48:00.000]   She was dressed in traveling fur and leather, richly made, dark hair pulled back tight.
[03:48:00.000 --> 03:48:07.000]   Then warriors were swarming either side of her, chopping at the wounded Jeha as she wrenched her spear free.
[03:48:07.000 --> 03:48:15.000]   The Jeha warrior went down in a hail of blows, its head hacked from its body, that black mist spilling from its neck.
[03:48:15.000 --> 03:48:24.000]   A figure formed in the air, black-winged and red-eyed, hissing its fury, then it was gone, only a few ragged wisps remaining.
[03:48:24.000 --> 03:48:27.000]   "I wish they'd stopped doing that."
[03:48:27.000 --> 03:48:32.000]   Gundal was screaming orders to attack, though nobody seemed to be paying much attention to him.
[03:48:32.000 --> 03:48:35.000]   Most of his hangars on were running in different directions.
[03:48:35.000 --> 03:48:44.000]   Jeha saw one of the Jeha grab Gundal by the scruff of his neck and start dragging him through the crowd, three or four Jeha carving away for him through the melee.
[03:48:44.000 --> 03:48:50.000]   Gundal spluttered a protest, but the Jeha just marched resolutely on.
[03:48:50.000 --> 03:48:57.000]   Jael lurched into motion, saw them as his best way of getting out of this and stumbled close behind them.
[03:48:57.000 --> 03:49:04.000]   A huddle of warriors crashed into them, mostly enemy all striking at a Jeha in their midst.
[03:49:04.000 --> 03:49:10.000]   With a grimace, Jael drew his sword and pulled a knife from his belt.
[03:49:10.000 --> 03:49:13.000]   Pain over death, always the better option.
[03:49:13.000 --> 03:49:20.000]   He hacked at a warrior's head, bursts of agony pulsing from his damaged ribs.
[03:49:20.000 --> 03:49:27.000]   He dented the man's helm, then slashed at another with his knife, leaving a long red wound, this warrior lurching away.
[03:49:27.000 --> 03:49:36.000]   Then they were past them, Jael adding his blades to the Jeha as they cut, hewed, punched and stabbed their way through the battling mass.
[03:49:36.000 --> 03:49:43.000]   Off to his left, Jael saw the woman still wielding her spear a group of warriors tight about her.
[03:49:43.000 --> 03:49:48.000]   He had seen her before, at the great council of Aquilas in Gerulain.
[03:49:48.000 --> 03:49:52.000]   He blinked as recognition dawned.
[03:49:52.000 --> 03:50:04.000]   "Fidelae, Aquilas's wife or widow now, Nathare's mother, what is she doing here and fighting against Nathare's ally?"
[03:50:04.000 --> 03:50:11.000]   He grunted as he ducked a sword blow aimed at his head, chopped at an ankle, then glanced back to Fidelae.
[03:50:11.000 --> 03:50:23.000]   "She'd make a good hostage, either to buy me safe passage out of here or a good trophy to present an affair, something to win back some favour and prestige from the disastrous mess this campaign has become."
[03:50:23.000 --> 03:50:35.000]   They were almost through the main press of battle now. Jael could see empty road beyond a few clumps of combat, the darkness of fawn beckoning, promising safety.
[03:50:35.000 --> 03:50:38.000]   Battle cries snapped his attention back.
[03:50:38.000 --> 03:50:42.000]   Beside him, one of the Jeha fell to its knee.
[03:50:42.000 --> 03:50:51.000]   It struggled to rise but another warrior lunged in close and his sword swing took the Jeha's head, black vapour spewed from the wound.
[03:50:51.000 --> 03:51:01.000]   The Jeha that had been dragging Gundal let go of him to join the fray, sword rising and falling, a warrior staggering away with a terrible gash from his forehead to his chin.
[03:51:01.000 --> 03:51:06.000]   Gundal slipped and fell to the ground beside Jael and grabbed at his boot.
[03:51:06.000 --> 03:51:12.000]   "Help me!" Gundal cried, trying to climb up Jael's leg and pull himself back to his feet.
[03:51:12.000 --> 03:51:21.000]   Jael sneered down at him, remembering how Gundal had mocked him back in his tent. "I don't need you or your horses now."
[03:51:21.000 --> 03:51:35.000]   He pulled his sword back and stabbed it into Gundal's screaming mouth, smashing teeth on into the soft tissue of his throat, jerked it out red, left the King of Carnatan bleeding out his life in the dirt of fawn.
[03:51:35.000 --> 03:51:43.000]   Looking up again, he saw that the last few moments of frantic combat had swung them close to the woman he was sure was Fidole.
[03:51:43.000 --> 03:51:48.000]   "At last, fate smiles upon me once more."
[03:51:48.000 --> 03:51:56.000]   He swerved around a mass of combat and strode straight towards her.
[03:51:56.000 --> 03:52:02.000]   Chapter 17 - Maquine
[03:52:02.000 --> 03:52:10.000]   Maquine burst out from the rows of tents onto the embankment. The tangled snare of fawn forest loomed close by.
[03:52:10.000 --> 03:52:15.000]   At the top of the embankment, Gundal's new road carved a line into the trees.
[03:52:15.000 --> 03:52:21.000]   Figures fought upon it, the clamor and stench of combat drifting down to Maquine.
[03:52:21.000 --> 03:52:25.000]   "Where is he? Where's Jael?"
[03:52:25.000 --> 03:52:40.000]   As he had run through the fractured camp, memory upon memory had flooded Maquine's mind, of a lifetime served as Castell's oath-sworn shieldman, of friendship, loyalty and love, and finally one memory overwhelming all of the others.
[03:52:40.000 --> 03:52:53.000]   Of Jael, plunging a sword into Castell's belly, those few heartbeats replayed in his mind time and time again until his whole world was a place of heartbreak and rage.
[03:52:53.000 --> 03:52:55.000]   "Where is he?"
[03:52:55.000 --> 03:52:58.000]   "He came this way, I know it."
[03:52:58.000 --> 03:53:06.000]   Maquine had lived in fawn with the Gadre and learned the way of wood and forest, not that Jael was hard to track.
[03:53:06.000 --> 03:53:10.000]   He'd left a trail of his own blood for Maquine to follow.
[03:53:10.000 --> 03:53:12.000]   "But where now?"
[03:53:12.000 --> 03:53:15.000]   Which way did he go?
[03:53:15.000 --> 03:53:22.000]   Maquine knelt in the grass, searching, fingertips running across the ground. They came away, sticky.
[03:53:22.000 --> 03:53:24.000]   Blood.
[03:53:24.000 --> 03:53:27.000]   Another patch apace up the embankment.
[03:53:27.000 --> 03:53:34.000]   Something crossed Maquine's face, part snarl, part smile, and he bounded up the slope to the road.
[03:53:34.000 --> 03:53:42.000]   Battle was mostly finished here, the dead littering the ground, others lying and waiting for death's last touch, wounds gaping.
[03:53:42.000 --> 03:53:49.000]   Screams and weeping. Ragged breaths. Some men just sitting, staring at blood-crusted palms.
[03:53:49.000 --> 03:53:55.000]   Battles still raged further along the road, the trees of four in a tunnel about them.
[03:53:55.000 --> 03:54:03.000]   Maquine glimpsed Karashim in their coats of dark males scattered amongst the black and silver of Veradis's rearguard.
[03:54:03.000 --> 03:54:13.000]   A figure moved beyond the combat, drawing his eye, disappeared, reappeared. A man, dark-haired, just a glimpse, but Maquine knew him.
[03:54:13.000 --> 03:54:15.000]   Jael.
[03:54:15.000 --> 03:54:25.000]   He ran, leaping the fallen, a short sword hissing from a scabbard across his back, a knife gripped in his other hand, never taking his eyes from Jael.
[03:54:25.000 --> 03:54:34.000]   Behind him, Maquine heard the drum of many feet. Over it, a heavier thud. Knew that Alcion and the others had arrived.
[03:54:34.000 --> 03:54:43.000]   He ran on, skirting the combat. Glimpsed Veradis with a handful of men bring Akadesham to bay, like hounds snapping at a bear or wolfen.
[03:54:43.000 --> 03:54:51.000]   Maquine gave it all barely a glance because he was close to Jael now, so close he could see his eyes that cut across his scalp.
[03:54:51.000 --> 03:55:03.000]   He was heading diagonally across the combat, through it, and Maquine followed, a wraith that wound his way through the tumult, ducking, bending, swaying, always moving.
[03:55:03.000 --> 03:55:13.000]   Dimly behind him, he heard voices raised in battle cry, Alcion's deep bass rumbling over it like an avalanche as he joined the fray.
[03:55:13.000 --> 03:55:27.000]   Maquine hardly noticed. He was so close, a dozen paces behind Jael when he lost sight of him for a moment, heard the harsh clang of iron, a grunt, the thud of a body hitting the ground, then a scream, higher-pitched, a woman's scream.
[03:55:27.000 --> 03:55:35.000]   "No. Dear Elion, no." He knew that voice. Would recognize it anywhere.
[03:55:35.000 --> 03:55:43.000]   Fidele. He shouldered one of Ripper's warriors out of the way and burst through the last knot of combat.
[03:55:43.000 --> 03:55:50.000]   A warrior lay dead at his feet, others standing, pointing swords and spears at a figure further along the road.
[03:55:50.000 --> 03:56:02.000]   Jael. He stood facing Maquine, one arm around Fidele's throat resting his sword blade against the pulse in her neck, his other hand holding a knife tight to her ribs.
[03:56:02.000 --> 03:56:08.000]   "Follow me, and she's dead," Jael said calmly.
[03:56:08.000 --> 03:56:16.000]   He shuffled backwards, dragging Fidele with him. She saw Maquine appear from the crowd, their eyes touching.
[03:56:16.000 --> 03:56:23.000]   She did not appear scared. If anything, she looked angry. An emotion I know well.
[03:56:23.000 --> 03:56:31.000]   A warrior beside Maquine took a step forwards and Jael moved. A line of blood trickled from the blade of Fidele's throat.
[03:56:31.000 --> 03:56:35.000]   Maquine grabbed a fistful of the warrior's shirt and held him still.
[03:56:35.000 --> 03:56:43.000]   "That's better," Jael said, a smile twitching his lips. How Maquine hated that smile.
[03:56:43.000 --> 03:56:51.000]   "I'm going to walk away. Have no fear. I'll not harm this lady. I know who she is, Fidele of Tenebraal.
[03:56:51.000 --> 03:56:58.000]   She will be safe with me, but she will stay with me. And if any of you should follow..."
[03:56:58.000 --> 03:57:05.000]   He prodded Fidele in the ribs with his knife, making her grimace. She was still staring at Maquine.
[03:57:05.000 --> 03:57:10.000]   "Trust me," Maquine mouthed, then stepped out from the crowd.
[03:57:10.000 --> 03:57:15.000]   The muscles in Jael's sword arm tensed, then he recognized Maquine and paused.
[03:57:15.000 --> 03:57:20.000]   "Not you again," Jael sighed. "Don't you ever give up?"
[03:57:20.000 --> 03:57:23.000]   Maquine took a pace forwards.
[03:57:23.000 --> 03:57:32.000]   "Do you wish to be responsible for the death of Fidele, Lady of Tenebraal?" Jael snapped, resuming his slow shuffle back down the road.
[03:57:32.000 --> 03:57:44.000]   "Kill her," Maquine growled, taking another step forwards, focused on Jael's eyes. "Stay back?" Jael said, his voice rising in pitch. "Or she dies."
[03:57:44.000 --> 03:57:58.000]   "Did you not hear me?" Maquine said, taking another step. "Kill her. I care not. Either way, this is where you die. Nothing will change that now."
[03:57:58.000 --> 03:58:03.000]   He took another pace forwards and another, closing the gap between them.
[03:58:03.000 --> 03:58:07.000]   Jael stumbled backwards, dragging Fidele with him.
[03:58:07.000 --> 03:58:19.000]   "Are you mad? She is the Mother of Nithair. She is the First Lady of Tenebraal. Her warband is standing behind you. Harm her, and they will gut you."
[03:58:19.000 --> 03:58:25.000]   Maquine shrugged. "Once you're dead, they can do what they like to me."
[03:58:25.000 --> 03:58:31.000]   "Stop!" Jael screeched, his knife hand pulling back. Maquine stopped.
[03:58:31.000 --> 03:58:37.000]   "I have an offer for you," he said, as he slowly bent his knees, laid his sword and knife on the ground.
[03:58:37.000 --> 03:58:40.000]   "An offer?" "Aye."
[03:58:40.000 --> 03:58:53.000]   Maquine reached over his shoulder and drew his other sword, laid that on the ground too, unsheathed a knife from his belt, another from a shoulder strap, one from the back of his boot, laying them all upon the ground.
[03:58:53.000 --> 03:59:01.000]   "Let her go. I'll fight you unarmed. Keep your sword and your knife."
[03:59:01.000 --> 03:59:05.000]   He stood straight and raised his hands, started walking forwards again.
[03:59:05.000 --> 03:59:12.000]   "You're insane," Jael snorted, eyes glancing from Maquine to the pile of weapons on the ground.
[03:59:12.000 --> 03:59:21.000]   "Maybe," Maquine shrugged. "He murdered my ward, my friend. Castell was as a son to me."
[03:59:21.000 --> 03:59:29.000]   "I will see you dead, even if I have to do it with my bare hands."
[03:59:29.000 --> 03:59:37.000]   He could see the indecision in Jael's eyes. The man was tempted. That was clear, and why not?
[03:59:37.000 --> 03:59:44.000]   He was a master with the sword, with any blade, and had both sword and knife in his hands against an unarmed man.
[03:59:44.000 --> 03:59:52.000]   "You've more knives hidden away." "No," Maquine shook his head. "You're just afraid to fight me."
[03:59:52.000 --> 03:59:55.000]   Jael snorted but stopped his backward shuffling.
[03:59:55.000 --> 04:00:06.000]   "You're afraid," Maquine said louder. "You, Jael, murderer and usurper, a coward as well."
[04:00:06.000 --> 04:00:13.000]   A moment's pause, Jael's eyes narrowing. Then he was lifting his sword arm to club Fidole across the back of the head.
[04:00:13.000 --> 04:00:21.000]   In that breath, she stamped on his foot and drove an elbow into his ribs, spinning around and driving her knee into his groin.
[04:00:21.000 --> 04:00:26.000]   Jael staggered and rocked backwards, and then Fidole was leaping away from him.
[04:00:26.000 --> 04:00:31.000]   "Bitch!" Jael snarled, moving after her but clumsily.
[04:00:31.000 --> 04:00:34.000]   In a heartbeat, Maquine was standing in front of her.
[04:00:34.000 --> 04:00:38.000]   "Go!" Maquine breathed as he squeezed Fidole's hand.
[04:00:38.000 --> 04:00:43.000]   Dimly, he was aware of silence settling behind him.
[04:00:43.000 --> 04:00:49.000]   "Go!" he said firmer, and heard her footsteps pad a dozen or so paces away.
[04:00:49.000 --> 04:00:54.000]   Jael paused, looking at Maquine's empty hands.
[04:00:54.000 --> 04:00:59.000]   "You really don't have any more weapons," he said. Another smirk.
[04:00:59.000 --> 04:01:03.000]   "You actually are insane. I'm going to enjoy this."
[04:01:03.000 --> 04:01:09.000]   "Don't need my own blade," Maquine said. "I'll just take one of yours."
[04:01:09.000 --> 04:01:16.000]   He strode forwards, swayed away from Jael's diagonally chopping sword, pivoted past a stab of Jael's knife,
[04:01:16.000 --> 04:01:20.000]   stepped in close and punched Jael in the ribs, making him cry out.
[04:01:20.000 --> 04:01:26.000]   Another punch to the sword cut on Jael's leg elicited a grunt of pain.
[04:01:26.000 --> 04:01:33.000]   "For Castel," Maquine said, close to Jael's ear. Then he was spinning away.
[04:01:33.000 --> 04:01:42.000]   Jael cursed, visibly mastered his pain, set his stance and came at Maquine carefully, sword held high, knife low.
[04:01:42.000 --> 04:01:49.000]   Maquine stepped in to meet Jael, palm of his hand slapping the blade of Jael's sword away as he attempted a straight lunge,
[04:01:49.000 --> 04:01:55.000]   grabbed Jael's knife wrist and head-butted the man full on the bridge of his nose.
[04:01:55.000 --> 04:02:00.000]   Jael spluttered, blood gushing, Maquine shoving him back.
[04:02:00.000 --> 04:02:04.000]   "For Castel," Maquine growled.
[04:02:04.000 --> 04:02:10.000]   Jael spat, cuffed blood from his face, danced forwards, swinging his sword.
[04:02:10.000 --> 04:02:15.000]   Maquine ducked, hair whistling over his head. He twisted, felt a hot pain lance along his ribs,
[04:02:15.000 --> 04:02:22.000]   heard shouting behind him, punched Jael on his injured leg again as he spun out of range, heard another cry of pain.
[04:02:22.000 --> 04:02:26.000]   "For Castel," he breathed.
[04:02:26.000 --> 04:02:30.000]   Jael looked at a red line that his knife had scored through the leather of Maquine's jerkin.
[04:02:30.000 --> 04:02:34.000]   "Bleed, like the rest of us then."
[04:02:34.000 --> 04:02:40.000]   Maquine ignored him and darted forwards, weaved past a sword thrust, kicked out at Jael's ankle, connecting,
[04:02:40.000 --> 04:02:45.000]   hand chopping at Jael's throat, grabbing his knife hand and twisting.
[04:02:45.000 --> 04:02:52.000]   Jael squawked in pain, his knife clattering to the road, Maquine kicking it away and darting out of range.
[04:02:52.000 --> 04:02:57.000]   "For Castel," he said as he spun away again.
[04:02:57.000 --> 04:03:03.000]   "Stop saying that!" Jael yelled at him, spittle flying, then ran at him more of a hobble.
[04:03:03.000 --> 04:03:10.000]   Maquine stooped to sweep up the fallen knife, twisting away from Jael's sword, slashed once with the knife.
[04:03:10.000 --> 04:03:15.000]   Jael cried out with pain as he stumbled on, almost falling.
[04:03:15.000 --> 04:03:20.000]   He regained his balance and backed away from Maquine, limping as blood ran down the back of his leg.
[04:03:20.000 --> 04:03:25.000]   Maquine strode at him, for the first time seeing fear in Jael's eyes.
[04:03:25.000 --> 04:03:32.000]   "Do you remember? In the tomb, beneath Haldis," Maquine said, not breaking his stride.
[04:03:32.000 --> 04:03:38.000]   "It was a fair fight," Jael said, pleading, shuffling away, leaving a trail of blood from his wounded leg.
[04:03:38.000 --> 04:03:54.000]   "He was your kin! And you betrayed him! You murdered him!" Maquine said, exploding into movement, leaping forwards, dancing to the side around Jael's sword, a slice at Jael's arm, a yell, and the sword was falling.
[04:03:54.000 --> 04:04:03.000]   They crashed into each other, limbs tangled, fell to the ground, rolled, Jael finding new strength as he punched, kicked, and bit at Maquine.
[04:04:03.000 --> 04:04:11.000]   Maquine grabbed one of Jael's arms, pinned it as they rolled together, inched his knife blade up towards Jael's throat.
[04:04:11.000 --> 04:04:19.000]   Jael's efforts redoubled, his free fist punching at Maquine's head, his gut, anywhere, everywhere.
[04:04:19.000 --> 04:04:22.000]   Maquine grunted but did not let go.
[04:04:22.000 --> 04:04:27.000]   Jael was grabbing at Maquine's wrist, unable to stop it moving remorselessly upwards.
[04:04:27.000 --> 04:04:33.000]   They rolled to a halt. Maquine squeezed, twisted, and Jael's pinned arm cracked.
[04:04:33.000 --> 04:04:39.000]   Jael screamed high and long as a stuck bore, the fight draining from him.
[04:04:39.000 --> 04:04:45.000]   Then Maquine's knife was at Jael's throat, tip pressing into the soft flesh at the base of the jaw.
[04:04:45.000 --> 04:04:48.000]   "Please!" Jael sobbed.
[04:04:48.000 --> 04:04:56.000]   "For Castell," Maquine whispered. Then he shoved the blade up with all his strength.
[04:04:56.000 --> 04:05:03.000]   Jael made a choking sound, gurgling on dark blood that welled from his mouth dribble down his chin.
[04:05:03.000 --> 04:05:12.000]   He struggled, but Maquine pushed the blade deeper, on into his skull, kept pushing until the knife's hilt was tight to Jael's flesh.
[04:05:12.000 --> 04:05:19.000]   Jael's eyes bulged, then he spasmed, legs kicking, slowed, became still.
[04:05:19.000 --> 04:05:24.000]   Maquine rolled away, slowly stood and looked down upon Jael.
[04:05:24.000 --> 04:05:32.000]   He grimaced, part snarl, felt suddenly weak and dropped to his knees, then sat and stared at Jael's corpse.
[04:05:32.000 --> 04:05:38.000]   "You are avenged, Castell. You who were like a son to me."
[04:05:38.000 --> 04:05:43.000]   He felt his shoulders begin to shake, tears blur his vision,
[04:05:43.000 --> 04:05:49.000]   and then a hand was stroking his head, a warm body beside him, pulling him into an embrace.
[04:05:49.000 --> 04:05:53.000]   He laid his head upon Fidele's breast and wept.
[04:05:53.000 --> 04:06:01.000]   He didn't know how long he remained like that, but in time the world opened up from that small pinpoint of grief and he became aware of voices.
[04:06:01.000 --> 04:06:05.000]   He looked up and saw the warband of Ripper gathered in a half-circle about him.
[04:06:05.000 --> 04:06:12.000]   Veridis, Krellis, Albin, Alcyon, and so many others, hundreds of them, all watching him.
[04:06:12.000 --> 04:06:22.000]   "Well, that was a cracking fire and no denying," Krellis said, nodding to Maquine, lifting a skin of mead to his lips and drinking deep.
[04:06:22.000 --> 04:06:26.000]   "What now?" Fidele answered.
[04:06:26.000 --> 04:06:30.000]   "Now we march on Drassil."
[04:06:30.000 --> 04:06:35.000]   Chapter 18
[04:06:35.000 --> 04:06:38.000]   Coen
[04:06:38.000 --> 04:06:44.000]   Coen stood in the great courtyard before the gates of Drassil alongside her fellow prisoners.
[04:06:44.000 --> 04:06:52.000]   Calidus walked down the staircase that led to the battlements where he had announced his challenge to Corbin as he did each and every morning.
[04:06:52.000 --> 04:06:57.000]   "Save the lives of your people. Stop their torture."
[04:06:57.000 --> 04:07:09.000]   As always, Corbin did not come and now Calidus began the second half of each day's ritual, choosing a prisoner to be impaled within the courtyard.
[04:07:09.000 --> 04:07:18.000]   Almost a moon had passed since Drassil had fallen so unimaginably quickly. A moon of heartache and pain.
[04:07:18.000 --> 04:07:31.000]   Although she was a prisoner, Coen had been allowed to take charge of the makeshift hospice that she and Brynna had spent so long stocking and preparing, choosing a few staff to help her from amongst the more able-bodied prisoners.
[04:07:31.000 --> 04:07:39.000]   She was permitted to heal the captured only if she also looked after those in the fair's army who had been wounded in the battle.
[04:07:39.000 --> 04:07:46.000]   Much as Coen despised doing so, she knew it was the only way to help her own people.
[04:07:46.000 --> 04:07:51.000]   Calidus stopped a dozen steps up from the courtyard and looked at the gathered prisoners.
[04:07:51.000 --> 04:08:01.000]   "It seems that your bright star has better things to do than save your lives," he said, voice laced with anger.
[04:08:01.000 --> 04:08:05.000]   Coen shivered involuntarily at the thought of what was to come of the screams.
[04:08:05.000 --> 04:08:12.000]   She was no stranger to death now, but nothing could make her immune to the horror she witnessed each morning.
[04:08:12.000 --> 04:08:16.000]   "Corbin, come and save us."
[04:08:16.000 --> 04:08:20.000]   With each passing day it seemed more impossible.
[04:08:20.000 --> 04:08:28.000]   For the first few days she had been practically convinced that her brother would somehow return with a warband and win back Drassil, defeat their enemy.
[04:08:28.000 --> 04:08:33.000]   But with each scream-filled mourning, that hope had withered.
[04:08:33.000 --> 04:08:42.000]   Calidus gave a curt nod and a Karashim stepped out from the shadows of the stable blocks, moving amongst the prisoners, dragging one forwards.
[04:08:42.000 --> 04:08:51.000]   As always, Coen's heart seemed to freeze, feeling as if it swelled to fill her chest as a single Karashim walked down the line that she was standing in.
[04:08:51.000 --> 04:08:57.000]   It was the figure that was always surrounded by billowing clouds of flies.
[04:08:57.000 --> 04:09:07.000]   It paused before her, one fist grabbing her chin and lifting it to stare into her eyes, though there was nothing there, its eyes were black, soulless wells.
[04:09:07.000 --> 04:09:16.000]   A lunatic grin twisted its mouth and a black tongue flickered out from its mouth, thick and swollen, and slowly licked her cheek.
[04:09:16.000 --> 04:09:25.000]   She retched from its foul breath, but the Karashim held her immovable while flies crawled over her face up her nose.
[04:09:25.000 --> 04:09:38.000]   "One day, soon," it whispered in her ear, "I will crush your skull and suck the jelly from your eyes."
[04:09:38.000 --> 04:09:47.000]   Then it released her, grabbing the man beside her, one of those who had been saved from the Vinthalan orebenches, and dragged him towards a stake.
[04:09:47.000 --> 04:09:50.000]   He began to plead, then wail.
[04:09:50.000 --> 04:09:57.000]   It did no good, and soon his horrific screams were ringing out, a cacophony of torment.
[04:09:57.000 --> 04:10:00.000]   There was no hiding from it.
[04:10:00.000 --> 04:10:10.000]   The sound climbed, sweeping over the walls and on, out over the plains surrounding the fortress into the silent trees of Thorne.
[04:10:10.000 --> 04:10:15.000]   Have Corbin and the survivors fled, or retreated?
[04:10:15.000 --> 04:10:22.000]   Calidus strode down from the battlement steps and with an irritable wave of his hand signaled for the surviving prisoners to be taken away.
[04:10:22.000 --> 04:10:28.000]   The warriors of Tenebraal, in black and silver, herded Cohen and the others out of the courtyard.
[04:10:28.000 --> 04:10:35.000]   She wrinkled her nose as they passed the stables, the stench of Nefere's draig clawing up her nose.
[04:10:35.000 --> 04:10:41.000]   She'd smelt a lot of bad things in her time, but nothing like the smell of draig dung.
[04:10:41.000 --> 04:10:45.000]   She heard a hoarse neigh as they moved past the stables.
[04:10:45.000 --> 04:10:47.000]   Shield?
[04:10:47.000 --> 04:10:59.000]   When Drassil had fallen to Calidus and Nefere's warband, the stables had been full of horses, great war horses that the Ji'har rode, a whole herd that had been saved from the destruction of Graham's hold.
[04:10:59.000 --> 04:11:07.000]   They were still there, and created another task that the prisoners were used for, stable duty, tending to the horses.
[04:11:07.000 --> 04:11:13.000]   Every time that Cohen was picked she had managed to get close to Shield, Corbin's stallion.
[04:11:13.000 --> 04:11:20.000]   As they left the courtyard and entered a wide street, shouts rang out from the wall, then horns sounded.
[04:11:20.000 --> 04:11:26.000]   The great bars across the gates were drawn back, and the gates opened with a juddering creak.
[04:11:26.000 --> 04:11:32.000]   Figures filled the open gates, silhouettes with the sun behind them.
[04:11:32.000 --> 04:11:35.000]   They became clearer as they spilt into the courtyard.
[04:11:35.000 --> 04:11:41.000]   Vinthallan, a score, two score, maybe more, many of them were wounded.
[04:11:41.000 --> 04:11:49.000]   So something is out there then, hidden within the trees of Faun, something with teeth of iron.
[04:11:49.000 --> 04:11:55.000]   As she was marched away from the courtyard, Cohen felt a seed of hope glimmer deep inside.
[04:11:55.000 --> 04:12:02.000]   It was faint and fragile, and it wasn't helped much by what she saw around her on her way back to the hospice.
[04:12:02.000 --> 04:12:09.000]   Kadashim were prowling the streets, moving like shadows, their heads twitching at every sound.
[04:12:09.000 --> 04:12:14.000]   All around her she saw a host of Eagle Guard in their black and silver, manning gates and walls,
[04:12:14.000 --> 04:12:20.000]   filling once abandoned buildings, working at Forge and Barne, and the Vinthallan were everywhere.
[04:12:20.000 --> 04:12:28.000]   Many of them were half drunk and fighting, loitering on street corners, sitting in impromptu circles and throwing dice of bone.
[04:12:28.000 --> 04:12:35.000]   The numbers of her enemy seemed vast, far more than Corbin's warband had ever been, even at full strength.
[04:12:35.000 --> 04:12:38.000]   Could we ever have won?
[04:12:38.000 --> 04:12:47.000]   The dead from the battle had mostly been cleared from the streets now, here and there a dark stain on a flagstone acting as a stark reminder.
[04:12:47.000 --> 04:12:53.000]   As Cohen turned a corner, she saw a dog sniffing at a heaped rubbish pile.
[04:12:53.000 --> 04:12:59.000]   The dog was small and white. A ratter. "I know that dog."
[04:12:59.000 --> 04:13:03.000]   It was Halen's. "What happened to him?"
[04:13:03.000 --> 04:13:09.000]   She looked at the dog as she was marched past it. It was skinny and half starved, ribs visible.
[04:13:09.000 --> 04:13:14.000]   Halen must be dead. He loved that dog. Pots, he called him.
[04:13:14.000 --> 04:13:17.000]   "Just like my poor Budai."
[04:13:17.000 --> 04:13:19.000]   "What happened to him?"
[04:13:19.000 --> 04:13:22.000]   She had not seen him since before the battle.
[04:13:22.000 --> 04:13:28.000]   Perhaps he had been killed or maybe fled, though deep in her heart she doubted that.
[04:13:28.000 --> 04:13:32.000]   He was too loyal. Would not have left me like that.
[04:13:32.000 --> 04:13:40.000]   She drew level with the white dog and clicked her tongue, reached inside a pocket in her cloak and pulled out a chunk of bread.
[04:13:40.000 --> 04:13:47.000]   The dog lifted its head, sniffing, and after a moment's cautious indecision, darted over to her.
[04:13:47.000 --> 04:13:52.000]   She dropped the piece of bread and it caught it deftly and it was gone.
[04:13:52.000 --> 04:13:56.000]   She watched it scamper away, turn a corner and disappear.
[04:13:56.000 --> 04:14:01.000]   For a moment, she thought she saw something waiting for it, moving in the shadows.
[04:14:01.000 --> 04:14:10.000]   Guards ushered her and the other prisoners into the hospice, less than 300 of them now because of Callidus's morning ritual.
[04:14:10.000 --> 04:14:16.000]   The building was large enough to accommodate their numbers with a lower floor made of two interlinking chambers.
[04:14:16.000 --> 04:14:23.000]   Part of it had been partitioned off for the care of the injured. The rest turned into a makeshift prison for the others.
[04:14:23.000 --> 04:14:28.000]   Only one guard came into the hospice, the rest sitting out in the courtyard.
[04:14:28.000 --> 04:14:31.000]   Cohen heard the sound of dice on a throw board.
[04:14:31.000 --> 04:14:38.000]   Automatically she went into the adjoining chamber and checked on the injured. Not many of them left now.
[04:14:38.000 --> 04:14:47.000]   There had been a lot more after the battle but many had died, Cohen being unable to do little more for them than ease their passing across the bridge of swords.
[04:14:47.000 --> 04:14:56.000]   Now only a score remained in here, although, from what she'd just seen, she expected that her skills would now be required for the injured Vinthallon.
[04:14:56.000 --> 04:15:00.000]   Frankly, she'd rather poison them than heal them.
[04:15:00.000 --> 04:15:07.000]   "Do not give up," she told herself, remembering her time as a prisoner with Nather and Callidus.
[04:15:07.000 --> 04:15:09.000]   All had seemed hopeless then.
[04:15:09.000 --> 04:15:14.000]   That time, Corbin had come out of nowhere and rescued her.
[04:15:14.000 --> 04:15:17.000]   Although Mam died in the undertaking.
[04:15:17.000 --> 04:15:26.000]   "I'll not let that happen again, people dying for my saving. I'll not wait around to be rescued. I will make my own fortune, whatever the cost."
[04:15:26.000 --> 04:15:29.000]   Cohen opened her eyes.
[04:15:29.000 --> 04:15:34.000]   After counting a hundred heartbeats and not hearing anything else but the usual snoring,
[04:15:34.000 --> 04:15:37.000]   she turned her head to check on their Vinthallonguard.
[04:15:37.000 --> 04:15:41.000]   As expected, he was asleep.
[04:15:41.000 --> 04:15:46.000]   Beyond the door she heard the muted sound of conversation, the occasional burst of laughter,
[04:15:46.000 --> 04:15:50.000]   the rest of their guards sitting in the courtyard drinking and gambling.
[04:15:50.000 --> 04:16:00.000]   At first, their guards had been vigilant, and rightly so, because there had been a smattering of jihad amongst the captives and they did not take well to being made prisoners.
[04:16:00.000 --> 04:16:08.000]   On the first night, two had attempted escape, killing eight guards, maiming three more and setting fire to another.
[04:16:08.000 --> 04:16:14.000]   Eventually they had both been subdued and executed in the courtyard the next day.
[04:16:14.000 --> 04:16:22.000]   Since then, no more escapes had been attempted and over time the guards had become correspondingly less vigilant.
[04:16:22.000 --> 04:16:31.000]   Cohen padded slowly from the room, making her way to a set of stairs leading up to a balcony that looked down upon the main hall with a dozen rooms opening off it.
[04:16:31.000 --> 04:16:36.000]   Almost silently, she passed into one of those rooms.
[04:16:36.000 --> 04:16:43.000]   There was one large window that let in a wide beam of moonlight, shockingly bright in the darkness.
[04:16:43.000 --> 04:16:50.000]   Cohen traced a familiar path to a cupboard, opened the door, shifted a loose board inside, and lifted out a package.
[04:16:50.000 --> 04:16:57.000]   She shuffled over to the window, sat with her back to the wall, facing the dark silhouette of the open doorway.
[04:16:57.000 --> 04:17:03.000]   She opened the old linen she'd wrapped round it to reveal a book, leather-bound and worn.
[04:17:03.000 --> 04:17:09.000]   She opened it towards the back and started reading the spidery script.
[04:17:09.000 --> 04:17:25.000]   "Rut, Eigen, Lo, Hara, Agada." A guarding spell. "Acacia Ansel." Boiling water. Worm root. Flayed skin.
[04:17:25.000 --> 04:17:30.000]   She paused there, a shiver goose-bumping her flesh.
[04:17:30.000 --> 04:17:36.000]   What did I expect from a book of giant spells? She pulled a face, fear and revulsion.
[04:17:36.000 --> 04:17:48.000]   It depends who the skin belonged to, I suppose. If it came from Calidus or Nefair or Lycus, Morcant or Wrynn, the list grew in her mind of enemies she'd like to do terrible things to.
[04:17:48.000 --> 04:17:56.000]   Brynna said, "It is a tool, not an evil of itself. It is how I use it that's important."
[04:17:56.000 --> 04:18:03.000]   She became aware of a sound. A soft snuffling from out of the window. Leaves rustled.
[04:18:03.000 --> 04:18:13.000]   Something in herb beds. Slowly, as quietly as she could manage, she peered up over the window's edge and looked out.
[04:18:13.000 --> 04:18:19.000]   Something was moving through the herb garden, nose to the ground, moving steadily towards the hospice.
[04:18:19.000 --> 04:18:25.000]   It paused, its white form reflecting moonlight, and looked up at Coen.
[04:18:25.000 --> 04:18:33.000]   "It's the dog from earlier. Halen's ratter." The dog turned in a circle and jumped on the spot.
[04:18:33.000 --> 04:18:36.000]   Coen was scared that it would start barking.
[04:18:36.000 --> 04:18:45.000]   Then, movement caught her eye, further back in a shadowed recess on the far side of the herb garden, a solid patch in the darkness.
[04:18:45.000 --> 04:18:49.000]   It whined, moved into the moonlight.
[04:18:49.000 --> 04:18:52.000]   Coen's breath caught in her chest.
[04:18:52.000 --> 04:19:00.000]   "Budai?" Without thinking, she jumped from the window, dropping into the soft earth of the herb bed.
[04:19:00.000 --> 04:19:07.000]   Before she had righted herself, Budai was bounding across the soft earth, hurling himself against her, rough tongue licking her face, whining.
[04:19:07.000 --> 04:19:14.000]   "Shh," she whispered, tears blurring her eyes as she kissed his muzzle.
[04:19:14.000 --> 04:19:17.000]   He didn't listen to her sloppily licking her face.
[04:19:17.000 --> 04:19:25.000]   "Where have you been?" she whispered, scratching him behind one floppy ear, running her other hand along the thick muscle of his neck.
[04:19:25.000 --> 04:19:29.000]   "Been feeding all right, by the look of you."
[04:19:29.000 --> 04:19:31.000]   Something was tied around him.
[04:19:31.000 --> 04:19:35.000]   Coen lifted it and inspected the long strip of leather.
[04:19:35.000 --> 04:19:37.000]   "A leash?"
[04:19:37.000 --> 04:19:45.000]   Then another sound caught her attention, a rustling close by in the herb bed, amongst the thick leaves of the basil and peppermint.
[04:19:45.000 --> 04:19:51.000]   She squinted, narrowed her eyes, saw someone appear from between the greenery.
[04:19:51.000 --> 04:19:55.000]   A face, small and pale, dirt-stained.
[04:19:55.000 --> 04:19:57.000]   It was Halen.
[04:19:57.000 --> 04:20:02.000]   Chapter 19
[04:20:02.000 --> 04:20:04.000]   Uthas
[04:20:04.000 --> 04:20:13.000]   "Ravans and crows," Uthas muttered as he trudged through the marshland, eyes looking skyward.
[04:20:13.000 --> 04:20:21.000]   He stumbled, his foot sinking with a splash into a patch of soft ground, and he leaned on his spear to lever himself upright.
[04:20:21.000 --> 04:20:26.000]   Salak, his shieldman, reached out a steadying hand from behind him.
[04:20:26.000 --> 04:20:30.000]   "Marshland is not a good place for a giant to walk."
[04:20:30.000 --> 04:20:33.000]   "What's that?" Rin said.
[04:20:33.000 --> 04:20:40.000]   She was sitting in the stern of a large boat, surrounded by a score of warriors as well as half a dozen rowers.
[04:20:40.000 --> 04:20:48.000]   Uthas was picking a path alongside the banks of the waterway she was being rowed down, a line of Banothi giants spread out along the bank behind him.
[04:20:48.000 --> 04:20:57.000]   "Ravans and crows," Uthas repeated, stopping and pointing up at the skies where a black shape spiraled high above them.
[04:20:57.000 --> 04:21:01.000]   "What about them?" Rin asked.
[04:21:01.000 --> 04:21:11.000]   She was in an unusually good mood this morning, the first that Uthas had seen since she had learned of her warband's defeat in the marshes and of the death of her huntsman, Braith.
[04:21:11.000 --> 04:21:18.000]   "I don't like them," Uthas grumbled, thinking of Feh, Naman's treacherous raven.
[04:21:18.000 --> 04:21:21.000]   Rin stared up at the speck in the sky.
[04:21:21.000 --> 04:21:29.000]   "I've always rather like them," she said, "and I suppose this one suspects that we'll be providing its dinner."
[04:21:29.000 --> 04:21:37.000]   Uthas scowled up at the bird. "Aye, as long as it's not our eyeballs and innards that it is feasting upon."
[04:21:37.000 --> 04:21:44.000]   He looked around him. More boats filled the waterway, bursting with over a thousand warriors.
[04:21:44.000 --> 04:21:54.000]   Not likely that we'll be losing this battle, he thought, looking at the grim faces of men in every boat, bristling with iron, and the fifty Banothi warriors behind him.
[04:21:54.000 --> 04:21:58.000]   More than enough to put down this little uprising.
[04:21:58.000 --> 04:22:07.000]   But since they had left the tower at the marshland's edge, a dour mood had fallen across Uthas's shoulders like a heavy cloak, and he could not shake it.
[04:22:07.000 --> 04:22:13.000]   We should be getting on with the important business of finding Evnis and the necklace. That is all that matters.
[04:22:13.000 --> 04:22:22.000]   Because when they found Naman's necklace, one of the seven treasures, then Uthas would be one huge step closer to achieving his dream.
[04:22:22.000 --> 04:22:29.000]   King of the giants. No more clans, no more divisions, just my kin behind me.
[04:22:29.000 --> 04:22:37.000]   But first I must find the necklace. Then it is to Daon and Dontaras to find the cup, and then...
[04:22:37.000 --> 04:22:43.000]   He saw Rafe appear up ahead, moving smoothly across the ground, his two hounds with him.
[04:22:43.000 --> 04:22:50.000]   He ran across the marshland towards them, hardly glancing at where he was putting his feet.
[04:22:50.000 --> 04:22:54.000]   Everything about the lads screamed vitality.
[04:22:54.000 --> 04:22:58.000]   Uthas rubbed at the small of his back and frowned.
[04:22:58.000 --> 04:23:04.000]   "There is something about him," Uthas mused. "Different. He hides something."
[04:23:04.000 --> 04:23:08.000]   "Rafe comes," Uthas said across the water to Rin.
[04:23:08.000 --> 04:23:16.000]   She held up a hand. The rudderman of her boat guided them towards the bank, the rowers slowing.
[04:23:16.000 --> 04:23:23.000]   All along their convoy, men did the same, the boats rippling to a halt like a long, sinuous water snake.
[04:23:23.000 --> 04:23:30.000]   "Is he alone?" Rin asked, as Uthas took her hand and helped her step from the boat. "Aye."
[04:23:30.000 --> 04:23:37.000]   Rafe had been given a score of woodsmen to help him scout out the ruins of Dunkrin, not that he seemed to need help.
[04:23:37.000 --> 04:23:42.000]   "Be careful," Uthas said. "I don't trust him."
[04:23:42.000 --> 04:23:48.000]   "I don't trust anyone," Rin replied with a scathing look and fixed her eyes on Rafe as he approached them.
[04:23:48.000 --> 04:23:54.000]   His two hounds reached them first, prowling a circle around Uthas which he didn't like.
[04:23:54.000 --> 04:23:59.000]   Rafe sprang across a stream and pulled to a halt, dipping his head to Rin.
[04:23:59.000 --> 04:24:04.000]   "My queen?" he said. "Well?" Rin snapped.
[04:24:04.000 --> 04:24:08.000]   "Dunkrin is ahead." A smile touched Rin's mouth.
[04:24:08.000 --> 04:24:12.000]   "It is abandoned."
[04:24:12.000 --> 04:24:20.000]   Well, he wasn't lying, Uthas thought, as he stepped around a long-branched willow and saw the ancient fortress towering out of the lake.
[04:24:20.000 --> 04:24:24.000]   He heard Salak mutter a curse behind him.
[04:24:24.000 --> 04:24:31.000]   His shieldmen had not seen Dunkrin before and it was a tragic sight, the once proud fortress laid low by time and circumstance.
[04:24:31.000 --> 04:24:41.000]   Dark walls and towers reared from the lake's water, like the submerged boughs of a rotting tree, reed and slime hanging from the decaying battlements.
[04:24:41.000 --> 04:24:48.000]   A great work brought down. "When I am king, I will restore the glory of my kin."
[04:24:48.000 --> 04:24:52.000]   Ahead of him, Rin hissed in frustration.
[04:24:52.000 --> 04:25:04.000]   "There's no one here," Morcant said. "Your powers of observation are staggering," Rin said, barely contained rage dripping from each word.
[04:25:04.000 --> 04:25:08.000]   A strange sound rang out overhead, making Uthas jump.
[04:25:08.000 --> 04:25:13.000]   He looked up and saw a scruffy-looking crow sitting in the branches of a willow.
[04:25:13.000 --> 04:25:17.000]   It was making a clacking sound, almost like laughing.
[04:25:17.000 --> 04:25:26.000]   Uthas gave it a dark look. Still making the odd noise, the crow winged into the air, spiraled up and flew away.
[04:25:26.000 --> 04:25:31.000]   Warriors were disembarking from boats to stand all along the lakeshore.
[04:25:31.000 --> 04:25:38.000]   Others had rode out to the waterlogged fortress, men climbing up onto the ancient battlements.
[04:25:38.000 --> 04:25:47.000]   Uthas tugged on one of the worm teeth set in his necklace as he stared at Dungrin, eyes sweeping the lakeshore, the willows and alders that lined it.
[04:25:47.000 --> 04:25:56.000]   The signs of recent life were all about abandoned shelters, woven willow fences, cold fire pits, fishing nets hanging.
[04:25:56.000 --> 04:26:02.000]   A pile of burned clothing, old boots and belts, some twisted war gear, nothing of much use.
[04:26:02.000 --> 04:26:10.000]   "The far shore," he said to Salak and Aysa beside him. They have younger eyes than I. "Men could be hiding there."
[04:26:10.000 --> 04:26:19.000]   "Can't see anything," Salak rumbled. He was disappointed, Uthas could tell. His shieldmen had been looking forward to a fight.
[04:26:19.000 --> 04:26:22.000]   "But it's far."
[04:26:22.000 --> 04:26:29.000]   "No one there," Rafe said from a dozen strides away. "He's back to them." He was standing and staring at the far shore.
[04:26:29.000 --> 04:26:33.000]   "Your eyes are good?" Uthas asked.
[04:26:33.000 --> 04:26:39.000]   "I can see a heron standing in the shade of that willow," Rafe said, pointing.
[04:26:39.000 --> 04:26:43.000]   Uthas squinted but could see nothing. Neither could Salak.
[04:26:43.000 --> 04:26:49.000]   Then there was a distant splash and a heron rose from deep shadows, flapping into the air.
[04:26:49.000 --> 04:26:57.000]   Wrynn barked orders and warriors began to sweep around both arms of the lakeshore, searching for hidden men wary of traps.
[04:26:57.000 --> 04:27:02.000]   Word of the last campaign against this fortress was in everyone's mind.
[04:27:02.000 --> 04:27:10.000]   "Why have they left here?" Morkan asked no one in particular. "To avoid you, I would suspect," Ryn said.
[04:27:10.000 --> 04:27:17.000]   Morkan nodded at that, thinking it a perfectly reasonable answer. "Well, we must chase them then," he said.
[04:27:17.000 --> 04:27:22.000]   "A fine idea," Ryn muttered. "Or maybe not. What do you think, Rafe?"
[04:27:22.000 --> 04:27:26.000]   The young huntsman frowned at that, was silent a while.
[04:27:26.000 --> 04:27:33.000]   "I can track them for you, my lady," he eventually said. "But I don't think it would be wise for your whole warband to give chase."
[04:27:33.000 --> 04:27:37.000]   "We could be led straight into another trap like last time, or worse."
[04:27:37.000 --> 04:27:46.000]   "Here we know the land, now, and your numbers would tell, out there," he gestured at the stinking marshland. "Who knows?"
[04:27:46.000 --> 04:27:53.000]   Calls were drifting over from the fortress, men signaling that the ruins were empty.
[04:27:53.000 --> 04:27:57.000]   Other men started adding their voices from the lakeshores they circled around.
[04:27:57.000 --> 04:28:08.000]   "They're fled," Salak rumbled. "Yes," Ryn agreed sourly. "But the question is not why, but where. Where are they?
[04:28:08.000 --> 04:28:15.000]   While we are stuck in the heart of Duncryn, where are they? And what are they doing?"
[04:28:15.000 --> 04:28:25.000]   "And where is Evnus?" Uthas thought. "He is the real prize. The only man with knowledge of where Naman's necklace is. All else is smoke on the wind."
[04:28:25.000 --> 04:28:36.000]   Voices shouted from further along the lakeshore, a different tone and cadence. Men appeared with someone definitely unwarrior-like between them.
[04:28:36.000 --> 04:28:45.000]   She was brought before Ryn, a woman of exceeding beauty, Uthas surmised, beneath the starvation and grime that coated her.
[04:28:45.000 --> 04:28:48.000]   She was dark-haired with green eyes.
[04:28:48.000 --> 04:28:59.000]   As she was held before Ryn, Uthas saw a host of emotions sweep this new woman's face. Pride. Fear. Hatred. Hope.
[04:28:59.000 --> 04:29:06.000]   Ryn stared at her, then began to laugh.
[04:29:06.000 --> 04:29:08.000]   Chapter 20
[04:29:08.000 --> 04:29:11.000]   Kamlin
[04:29:11.000 --> 04:29:15.000]   "Torched," Kamlin said, lifting his bow.
[04:29:15.000 --> 04:29:26.000]   A flaming arrow leapt into the air, followed by twenty more, all rising high into the blue sky, then arcing and falling towards the wooden tower and surrounding walls.
[04:29:26.000 --> 04:29:34.000]   "Again," Kamlin ordered, as the first volley slammed into the wooden palisade, gates, and buildings beyond.
[04:29:34.000 --> 04:29:43.000]   Meg dipped her torch into an iron brazier, crackling with fire, and ran along the line, igniting the arrows of Kamlin and the twenty other archers.
[04:29:43.000 --> 04:29:51.000]   They were standing on a shallow slope between the marshes and Morkant's tower. Idana's warband spread in a loose circle about it.
[04:29:51.000 --> 04:30:01.000]   On a plane to Kamlin's right stood the remains of an abandoned camp. Trampled grass, fire pits, torn tents, the stench of midden.
[04:30:01.000 --> 04:30:10.000]   A lot of men filled that space. Ryn's not underestimating us this time, though she'll be finding out soon that we're not playing by her rules.
[04:30:10.000 --> 04:30:24.000]   Kamlin held his arrow tip in Meg's torch, the pitch and kindling catching with a hiss, and then he was aiming high and loosing, his arrow rising and falling amongst the others, disappearing beyond the wall of Morkant's tower.
[04:30:24.000 --> 04:30:29.000]   Already black smoke was billowing into the clear sky.
[04:30:29.000 --> 04:30:36.000]   "They'll see that for a fair few leagues around," Baird said behind him, grinning as if he was in a midsummer's fair.
[04:30:36.000 --> 04:30:44.000]   He was stood to one side of Idana, Hallien and Von close by, as well as Lorkhan and his shieldman, Brogan.
[04:30:44.000 --> 04:30:52.000]   "That's the idea," Idana said. She was sterner. "Too long, Ryn has had this war her own way."
[04:30:52.000 --> 04:30:59.000]   "Aye. This is a message as much as anything else. Well, we'll not be dancing to Ryn's tune any longer."
[04:30:59.000 --> 04:31:03.000]   Kamlin held out another arrow for Meg to light.
[04:31:03.000 --> 04:31:12.000]   The gate tower was a crackling torch now, Morkant's tower beyond catching, bright flames licking one side.
[04:31:12.000 --> 04:31:18.000]   Figures were running along the wall, buckets of water were being thrown, but it seemed to be having little effect.
[04:31:18.000 --> 04:31:27.000]   "Too few of them," Kamlin thought. "Can't be more than thirty men in there. Ryn's taken everyone else into the marshes looking for us."
[04:31:27.000 --> 04:31:32.000]   A broad smile cracked his face as he thought of Ryn's expression when she heard about this.
[04:31:32.000 --> 04:31:39.000]   "That should do it," he said, slapping men on shoulders, and the row of archers lowered their bows.
[04:31:39.000 --> 04:31:47.000]   "Now what?" Idana asked. "Now we wait," Kamlin said. "Shouldn't take long."
[04:31:47.000 --> 04:31:55.000]   He was right. He didn't. Soon enough the palisade and enclosure were burning like a forest fire.
[04:31:55.000 --> 04:32:03.000]   One desperate man leapt over the palisade, apprehended immediately by a pandathrin and his men, followed shortly by others.
[04:32:03.000 --> 04:32:12.000]   Soon after the gates creaked open, black clouds of smoke billowing out, and a huddle of men appeared, stumbling and coughing out onto the slope.
[04:32:12.000 --> 04:32:20.000]   Some collapsed to the ground. Others stood with their arms raised in surrender as Idana's warriors closed in.
[04:32:20.000 --> 04:32:29.000]   Pandathrin herded the gathered prisoners down the slope. Kamlin glanced at Idana as she sighed and strode off towards the prisoners.
[04:32:29.000 --> 04:32:32.000]   Kamlin and the others followed.
[04:32:32.000 --> 04:32:40.000]   Thirty-six men were kneeling in the grass before Idana. They all wore the black and gold of Kamlin, Ryn's realm.
[04:32:40.000 --> 04:32:50.000]   Idana stood and stared at them a long moment. "How many of you are Ardun-born?" she asked. Faces looked up at her, some nodding, others raising a hand.
[04:32:50.000 --> 04:32:58.000]   "Twenty-eight," Kamlin counted. "Narvon?" Idana asked, and Drust stepped out from the warriors at her back.
[04:32:58.000 --> 04:33:03.000]   Five raised their hands. Drust narrowed his eyes and stared at them.
[04:33:03.000 --> 04:33:12.000]   "Which three are from Kamlin?" Idana asked. Two raised their hands and Kamlin saw one other who was staring fixedly at the grass at his knees.
[04:33:12.000 --> 04:33:22.000]   "Bring them before me?" Idana said, and Halion, Baird, and Von moved into the crowd, dragging the two who had raised their hands out of the group.
[04:33:22.000 --> 04:33:30.000]   "That one," Kamlin said, pointing at the other one, and he was dragged forwards too and thrown to the ground before Idana.
[04:33:30.000 --> 04:33:39.000]   "You are from Kamren," she said. "You have come here to Ardun with Ryn, invaded my country, killed my people."
[04:33:39.000 --> 04:33:47.000]   There was a tremor of rage in her voice. "You deserve death," Idana said, "and I sentence you to execution."
[04:33:47.000 --> 04:33:56.000]   Idana approached the other prisoners. "You others, you are Ardun and Narvon-born," she said. Men nodded eagerly. She frowned at them.
[04:33:56.000 --> 04:34:03.000]   "And yet you wear the colors of Ryn, Queen of Kamren. You have betrayed your country, served your enemy."
[04:34:03.000 --> 04:34:13.000]   Kamlin saw fear ripple through them like wind through long grass. "I will offer you my forgiveness. Once."
[04:34:13.000 --> 04:34:26.000]   "I think more than one of them will need to change their britches." "I will give you a choice. Fight for me, for your countries, or go home, either way you redeem yourselves."
[04:34:26.000 --> 04:34:47.000]   She looked long and hard at their faces. "If you go now, I shall not judge you. But if I see your faces again and you're standing against me, I'll see you die a death worthy of your betrayal. Make your choice," Idana said, and without waiting to see their reactions, she turned and strode away.
[04:34:47.000 --> 04:35:02.000]   Only Kamlin saw the tears fill her eyes. Kamlin sat with his back to a tree and watched Morcant's tower crumble in upon itself, a great cloud of smoke and ash billowing up into the air.
[04:35:02.000 --> 04:35:16.000]   He could see the bulk of Pandathrin as he led fifty men away to the east, skirting the treeline of the woods. Another group of men were waiting down there for Drust, going a separate ways for a while.
[04:35:16.000 --> 04:35:28.000]   The plan was to split into three groups, Pandathrin, Drust, and Idana each leading a band of warriors, the overall goal of each to make life in Arden hard for Rin.
[04:35:28.000 --> 04:35:40.000]   With a loud crash, the final section of Morcant's tower collapsed. Kamlin grinned, wishing he could see Morcant's face when he marched out of the marshes to see it.
[04:35:40.000 --> 04:35:49.000]   "A pretty sight, that tower coming down," he commented as he leaned forward and took a skewer of squirrel meat off the fire, tossing it to Meg.
[04:35:49.000 --> 04:35:58.000]   She took the meat, blowing on her fingers and biting, grease dripping down her chin. "We'll have to talk to her soon."
[04:35:58.000 --> 04:36:05.000]   He was surprised to find he felt sad about that. Strange as it seems, she's not the worst company.
[04:36:05.000 --> 04:36:26.000]   The drumbeat of hooves drew his eyes, and Kamlin watched a dozen riders cantering away in different directions, each with a large bag of silver taken from Morcant's chest, each one tasked with travelling through as many villages and holds as possible, spreading the word of Idana's victory at Dunkrin that she was alive and well in Arden and that she was fighting.
[04:36:26.000 --> 04:36:33.000]   And, of course, distributing a little silver to show that there was a bit of profit to be had if you rode with Idana.
[04:36:33.000 --> 04:36:39.000]   "We're moving forwards. Closer to the end, whether that be victory or death."
[04:36:39.000 --> 04:36:47.000]   "We'll be leaving the marshes behind us soon," he said conversationally. "I know that," Meg said, as if he was stupid.
[04:36:47.000 --> 04:36:55.000]   "Might be best for you if you and I made a trip to the next village along the marshes edge and I found a family to take you in."
[04:36:55.000 --> 04:37:07.000]   Her head snapped round and she glared at him. "No!" "This is your home, Meg," he said, with a jerk of his chin. "The marshlands, these people..."
[04:37:07.000 --> 04:37:14.000]   "We'll be leaving here, going back to Wooden Forest. That's where my kind of fighting works best."
[04:37:14.000 --> 04:37:21.000]   "We're going to war," he said, "and that's no place for you. You're eight summers old."
[04:37:21.000 --> 04:37:29.000]   "War's here, too," she said, looking at her feet. "What do you call what happened to my village? My mam?"
[04:37:29.000 --> 04:37:37.000]   There was a tremor in her voice now. He reached out and squeezed her hand. She sucked in a deep breath, stuck her lip out.
[04:37:37.000 --> 04:37:46.000]   "I've thought about it already," she said. "Bad things happen everywhere. My village didn't go marching off to war, but war still came and found them."
[04:37:46.000 --> 04:37:55.000]   "You can leave me here, but who's to say more can'ts?" She paused at his name, her sharp-featured face twisting with hatred.
[04:37:55.000 --> 04:38:00.000]   "Who's to say the same thing won't happen again? War band's out there."
[04:38:00.000 --> 04:38:08.000]   She waved angrily at the marshes, staring at him defiantly. "And you just leave me here and walk away?"
[04:38:08.000 --> 04:38:11.000]   "Well, didn't expect that."
[04:38:11.000 --> 04:38:19.000]   "As Hroth told, but that's the most words you've put together since I met you," Kamlin said, blowing out a long breath.
[04:38:19.000 --> 04:38:30.000]   "I like it here," she added, suddenly vulnerable, a child again. "And besides, try and leave me here or anywhere. I'll just give 'em the slip and follow you. Done it before."
[04:38:30.000 --> 04:38:35.000]   She grinned mischievously. Kamlin sighed.
[04:38:35.000 --> 04:38:39.000]   "Looks like you've thought it all through," she nodded.
[04:38:39.000 --> 04:38:43.000]   "Well, seems that's settled then."
[04:38:43.000 --> 04:38:52.000]   She gave him a long look, suspicious at first, which slowly changed to something resembling pleased, and she went back to eating her squirrel.
[04:38:52.000 --> 04:39:00.000]   He looked back to the tower, saw a black smudge swirl around the cloud of smoke and come flapping up the hill towards them.
[04:39:00.000 --> 04:39:02.000]   "Is that Kraff?"
[04:39:02.000 --> 04:39:07.000]   He felt a little jolt of relief, hadn't realized he'd been worried about the old crow.
[04:39:07.000 --> 04:39:13.000]   The crow saw him and spiraled down, started cawing as it drew close and alighted upon a branch over his head.
[04:39:13.000 --> 04:39:22.000]   "Kraff? Hungry?" it squawked, beady eyes staring at the pile of skin, bone, and offal that had been a squirrel a short while ago.
[04:39:22.000 --> 04:39:26.000]   "Help yourself?" Kamlin said with a wave of his hand.
[04:39:26.000 --> 04:39:30.000]   "Didn't think you usually asked," he added.
[04:39:30.000 --> 04:39:34.000]   When the crow had done, it hopped closer to Kamlin.
[04:39:34.000 --> 04:39:39.000]   "Well?" Kamlin asked, eager to hear the bird's news.
[04:39:39.000 --> 04:39:42.000]   "Idana?" Kraff squawked.
[04:39:42.000 --> 04:39:47.000]   "Aye, you're right," Kamlin said, groaning at his stiff back as he stood.
[04:39:47.000 --> 04:39:52.000]   "Better off saying a news once. She's over there."
[04:39:52.000 --> 04:39:56.000]   Kamlin strode through wide-spaced woodland towards Idana.
[04:39:56.000 --> 04:40:01.000]   She had fewer about her now, just Halyon, Von, and Baird.
[04:40:01.000 --> 04:40:04.000]   Nothing of her earlier emotion showed on her face.
[04:40:04.000 --> 04:40:07.000]   "She just looks tired," Kamlin thought.
[04:40:07.000 --> 04:40:14.000]   "Kraff's back?" Kamlin announced, and the crow fluttered down onto the log Idana was sitting on.
[04:40:14.000 --> 04:40:18.000]   "You're right?" Kamlin asked Idana.
[04:40:18.000 --> 04:40:24.000]   "My queen," he added, "after... earlier... the prisoners."
[04:40:24.000 --> 04:40:27.000]   She passed a hand over her eyes and sighed.
[04:40:27.000 --> 04:40:31.000]   "So much death," she said. "Will there ever be an end to it?"
[04:40:31.000 --> 04:40:37.000]   "Gotta believe there will be," Kamlin shrugged. "Col's hope of being told."
[04:40:37.000 --> 04:40:44.000]   He gave a lopsided grin. "Long as it doesn't end with ours. Death, that is."
[04:40:44.000 --> 04:40:47.000]   She smiled at that little snort of laughter.
[04:40:47.000 --> 04:40:52.000]   "How many stayed?" he asked, referring to the prisoners.
[04:40:52.000 --> 04:40:55.000]   "Twenty-eight," Halyon said.
[04:40:55.000 --> 04:40:58.000]   Kamlin nodded. "Shost them?"
[04:40:58.000 --> 04:41:01.000]   "Not really," Idana admitted.
[04:41:01.000 --> 04:41:07.000]   "But if I'm going to raise a warband, more than half the men of Arden are probably wearing Ryn's colors right now.
[04:41:07.000 --> 04:41:12.000]   I have to believe that it's against their will that they'd rather fight for me."
[04:41:12.000 --> 04:41:19.000]   "Think that's most likely true enough. Always some rotten apples in the barrel, though."
[04:41:19.000 --> 04:41:23.000]   "I know," Idana said. "But how do we root them out?"
[04:41:23.000 --> 04:41:31.000]   "New recruits. Put them at the front of the first battle, and the second. They'd improve themselves, risk dying for you.
[04:41:31.000 --> 04:41:35.000]   The baddens will most likely run first chance they get."
[04:41:35.000 --> 04:41:39.000]   Baird grunted approvingly, and Idana nodded thoughtfully at that.
[04:41:39.000 --> 04:41:44.000]   "I'll do that," she said. "Now, Kraff, what news have you for us?"
[04:41:44.000 --> 04:41:49.000]   "Ryn? A dun-kryn?" Kraff said. He paused and looked at them all.
[04:41:49.000 --> 04:41:51.000]   "Very angry."
[04:41:51.000 --> 04:41:55.000]   Baird laughed at that. "How many?" Halyan asked.
[04:41:55.000 --> 04:42:01.000]   "Lots," Kraff muttered. "Thousand? Ten thousand? And giants, from Morias?"
[04:42:01.000 --> 04:42:08.000]   Kamlin raised his eyebrows. "That explains the strange tracks in the meadow near Morcant's tower."
[04:42:08.000 --> 04:42:14.000]   "God war," Kraff muttered, ruffling feathers with his beak. "That again."
[04:42:14.000 --> 04:42:21.000]   Vonn tensed at Kraff's words. "It must be taken seriously," Vonn said.
[04:42:21.000 --> 04:42:25.000]   Vonn had already spoken to Idana and Kamlin about this god war,
[04:42:25.000 --> 04:42:29.000]   told them about how he had stolen the giant's book from his father, Evniss,
[04:42:29.000 --> 04:42:34.000]   which had, in turn, been taken from him by Brynner during their flight to Doen.
[04:42:34.000 --> 04:42:42.000]   Kamlin and Idana had witnessed this, but Vonn also told them of a necklace hidden in Evniss's tower at Dunkarrig.
[04:42:42.000 --> 04:42:46.000]   A necklace with a black stone as a pendant.
[04:42:46.000 --> 04:42:50.000]   "Ask Kraff what the seven treasures are," Vonn had said.
[04:42:50.000 --> 04:42:54.000]   "I don't need to ask, Kraff," Idana had replied. "I know the old tales as well as any.
[04:42:54.000 --> 04:42:59.000]   Cauldron and cup, spear, axe and dagger, torque and necklace."
[04:42:59.000 --> 04:43:08.000]   "Aye, necklace," Vonn had said. "It makes sense. Dunkarrig, fortress of the Menothi, Neman their queen."
[04:43:08.000 --> 04:43:13.000]   "So what if you're right?" Kamlin had asked.
[04:43:13.000 --> 04:43:18.000]   "If one of the seven treasures is in Dunkarrig, then we must do something about it.
[04:43:18.000 --> 04:43:25.000]   Kraff keeps squawking about the god war, a prophecy about Corbin and the bright star and black sun, about the seven treasures."
[04:43:25.000 --> 04:43:30.000]   "It all sounds right strange to me," Kamlin had said.
[04:43:30.000 --> 04:43:34.000]   "Aye, me too," Vonn had agreed. "But you're not understanding.
[04:43:34.000 --> 04:43:41.000]   If Kraff is right, if this god war is happening, then what is happening here in Arden is just a pebble in the ocean.
[04:43:41.000 --> 04:43:45.000]   If this is true, then we must help."
[04:43:45.000 --> 04:43:48.000]   "How would we help?" Idana had asked.
[04:43:48.000 --> 04:43:52.000]   "We must go and get the necklace and take it to Corbin in Drassil."
[04:43:52.000 --> 04:43:58.000]   Idana had just stared at Vonn. Kamlin hadn't been sure if she thought he was mad.
[04:43:58.000 --> 04:44:03.000]   "I'll think on it," was all that she had said, and then left.
[04:44:03.000 --> 04:44:07.000]   "I am taking it seriously," Idana said to Vonn.
[04:44:07.000 --> 04:44:12.000]   "Then what will be done about it, the god war, the necklace?" Vonn pressed.
[04:44:12.000 --> 04:44:19.000]   "I am going to retake Arden," Idana said slowly, "or die in the trying."
[04:44:19.000 --> 04:44:26.000]   "If, by some stroke of good fortune, I am victorious and Rin is slain or sent back to Kamrin,
[04:44:26.000 --> 04:44:35.000]   I will gladly tear Evanus's tower down, stone by stone, until this necklace is found and I will personally take it to Corbin in Drassil."
[04:44:35.000 --> 04:44:41.000]   "But until then, I must concentrate on what is in front of me, Arden and Rin, first."
[04:44:41.000 --> 04:44:44.000]   "Wrong?" Kraff said.
[04:44:44.000 --> 04:44:49.000]   "I like that bird." Bear chuckled. "He's got stones. Speaks his mind."
[04:44:49.000 --> 04:44:59.000]   "Well, a good counselor does, I suppose," Idana said. "But they also know when to stop and not labor a point," she added, with one eyebrow raised.
[04:44:59.000 --> 04:45:05.000]   "I have listened, weighed the choices, and I have made my decision. But—" Vonn began.
[04:45:05.000 --> 04:45:11.000]   "No!" Idana said, her voice rising. "Enough, Vonn!"
[04:45:11.000 --> 04:45:18.000]   Vonn scowled at her a long moment, jaw working as he struggled with the words itching to get out of his mouth.
[04:45:18.000 --> 04:45:22.000]   Then he clamped his jaw shut and nodded.
[04:45:22.000 --> 04:45:26.000]   Chapter 21
[04:45:26.000 --> 04:45:29.000]   Halen
[04:45:29.000 --> 04:45:34.000]   Halen stared at Coen as moonlight silvered her face.
[04:45:34.000 --> 04:45:38.000]   He was terrified being out as he had grown so accustomed to hiding,
[04:45:38.000 --> 04:45:46.000]   but Budai had been uncontrollable after he got a sniff of Potts snapping his leash and heading off into the darkness, and Potts had run with him.
[04:45:46.000 --> 04:45:52.000]   For one elongated moment, Halen had watched them go, then he'd been scrambling after them,
[04:45:52.000 --> 04:45:59.000]   cursing them both the entire time it had taken him to catch up with Budai and wrap the remains of the torn leash about his arm.
[04:45:59.000 --> 04:46:03.000]   Budai had calmed for a while when they reached his courtyard.
[04:46:03.000 --> 04:46:10.000]   Maybe the sounds of guardsmen and the crackling fire reminded him that death lurked around every corner in this place.
[04:46:10.000 --> 04:46:14.000]   That was until the figure had appeared at the window.
[04:46:14.000 --> 04:46:20.000]   Budai had taken a few deep sniffs through his broad muzzle, whined, and then he was off again,
[04:46:20.000 --> 04:46:25.000]   Halen standing no chance of even slowing him, let alone stopping him.
[04:46:25.000 --> 04:46:30.000]   "Halen, what are you doing here?" Coen whispered.
[04:46:30.000 --> 04:46:38.000]   "Chasing the dogs," he whispered back, eyes flitting between Coen and the firelight flickering at the building's corner.
[04:46:38.000 --> 04:46:42.000]   Coen smiled, ruffling Budai's fur.
[04:46:42.000 --> 04:46:50.000]   "I mean, how are you still alive? Where are you hiding? Are you alone? How do you have Budai with you?"
[04:46:50.000 --> 04:46:53.000]   She took a breath, clearly framing more questions.
[04:46:53.000 --> 04:46:57.000]   "It's not safe here," Halen said. "Come with me."
[04:46:57.000 --> 04:47:00.000]   He went to move away, but Coen gripped his wrist.
[04:47:00.000 --> 04:47:03.000]   "I'll tell you everything, I promise," he said.
[04:47:03.000 --> 04:47:08.000]   He looked up, the open sky, moon, and stars feeling like it went on forever.
[04:47:08.000 --> 04:47:10.000]   He shuddered.
[04:47:10.000 --> 04:47:12.000]   Coen stared at him and nodded.
[04:47:12.000 --> 04:47:15.000]   "Follow me," he whispered, and ran.
[04:47:15.000 --> 04:47:21.000]   They passed through wide streets, always keeping to the edges to the shadows.
[04:47:21.000 --> 04:47:29.000]   Soon they were entering a courtyard with an old oak at its center, its trunk wide and thick, roots churning up the flag-stoned floor.
[04:47:29.000 --> 04:47:32.000]   Halen headed to a deeper shadow in its midst.
[04:47:32.000 --> 04:47:42.000]   And then he was scrambling into it. Climbing into the hole that led to his den, his sense of safety grew palpably with each step deeper into his underground hiding place.
[04:47:42.000 --> 04:47:52.000]   "This way," Halen whispered, as they slithered down a slope about the length of a man and reached the spot where you could turn left or right.
[04:47:52.000 --> 04:47:57.000]   The familiar stench from the left drifted up to him, but by now Halen hardly noticed.
[04:47:57.000 --> 04:48:02.000]   Coen clearly did, though, wrinkling her nose and then putting a hand over her mouth.
[04:48:02.000 --> 04:48:06.000]   "That's disgusting," she whispered.
[04:48:06.000 --> 04:48:08.000]   Halen grunted and turned right.
[04:48:08.000 --> 04:48:16.000]   They shuffled along a dark, narrowing space, forced onto hands and knees as the tunnel they were in followed a twisting root.
[04:48:16.000 --> 04:48:21.000]   Then Halen heard a welcoming whine and saw a flicker of light. He smiled.
[04:48:21.000 --> 04:48:28.000]   A space opened up before him, wide enough for about six men to stand abreast and about a dozen paces long.
[04:48:28.000 --> 04:48:35.000]   Beyond that, the tunnel narrowed again, twisting off about the root it followed.
[04:48:35.000 --> 04:48:42.000]   The small chamber was lit by a bowl of oil on a knot in a thick root, flame dancing upon its surface.
[04:48:42.000 --> 04:48:53.000]   Two faces greeted him, Swain and Sif, Wolf's son and daughter, and six bundles of fur, Budai's and Storm's cubs bouncing and leaping in their excitement at his return.
[04:48:53.000 --> 04:48:58.000]   Seeing them like this, he realized how they'd grown.
[04:48:58.000 --> 04:49:06.000]   They were only five or six moons old, but already they were all taller than pots, their necks and broad chests thickening with muscle.
[04:49:06.000 --> 04:49:08.000]   Like Budai.
[04:49:08.000 --> 04:49:13.000]   They'll not grow as big as Storm, but big enough, and they'll be wide and strong, I don't doubt.
[04:49:13.000 --> 04:49:18.000]   "Calm down!" Sif scolded the cubs as they bounced into her.
[04:49:18.000 --> 04:49:24.000]   She was on her hands and knees playing with her bag of stones and nuts, rolling them into each other.
[04:49:24.000 --> 04:49:27.000]   Some of them Sif chalked white.
[04:49:27.000 --> 04:49:31.000]   I still don't understand that game, but it's kept Sif quiet for over a moon.
[04:49:31.000 --> 04:49:36.000]   Budai and pots burst into the chamber, making the cubs even more excited.
[04:49:36.000 --> 04:49:42.000]   One of them froze, black-faced and brindle-coated, and stared at the darkness of the tunnel.
[04:49:42.000 --> 04:49:46.000]   It growled, revealing a row of razor-sharp puppy teeth.
[04:49:46.000 --> 04:49:53.000]   "Shadow!" Halen said, reaching out a hand to the cub, but she didn't stop growling.
[04:49:53.000 --> 04:50:01.000]   The other cubs stopped their frolicking and stared too, cocking heads, and then they were all growling as Coen emerged from the darkness.
[04:50:01.000 --> 04:50:11.000]   Shadow, the black-faced cub, took a snarling step forwards, legs bunching, about to leap, the others moving tight about her, all growling, hackles up.
[04:50:11.000 --> 04:50:18.000]   Halen felt a real moment of panic, snapping a command at them that was completely ignored.
[04:50:18.000 --> 04:50:24.000]   Then Budai was standing between the cubs and Coen, baring his teeth, daring them.
[04:50:24.000 --> 04:50:35.000]   The cubs stopped, tails dropping, submitting. Shadow gave a last little growl of protest and then she too was quiet. Thank Aelion.
[04:50:35.000 --> 04:50:42.000]   "I thought they were going to attack me," Coen said, looking relieved as she stroked Budai's broad head.
[04:50:42.000 --> 04:50:47.000]   Then she threw her head back and laughed, long and sounding slightly mad.
[04:50:47.000 --> 04:50:53.000]   "I can't believe you're all here," Coen said, sitting down and cuddling Budai.
[04:50:53.000 --> 04:51:00.000]   Potts put his forelegs on Coen's shoulder and licked one of her ears. The cubs tentatively approached her, sniffing.
[04:51:00.000 --> 04:51:06.000]   Coen held her arms out and beckoned to Sif, who walked over and hesitantly allowed Coen to hug her.
[04:51:06.000 --> 04:51:13.000]   After about a count of ten, Sif was sitting in Coen's lap, hugging her tightly in return.
[04:51:13.000 --> 04:51:17.000]   "How's this happened?" Coen asked.
[04:51:17.000 --> 04:51:27.000]   "The battle," Swain started. "When it happened, we were here with the cubs." "Because Corbin had asked us to look after them," Sif said with big serious eyes.
[04:51:27.000 --> 04:51:33.000]   "He did, I remember," Coen agreed. "We didn't know what to do," Swain continued.
[04:51:33.000 --> 04:51:40.000]   I was terrified, Halen thought, remembering the distant din of battle, the screams and battle cries, flames, smoke.
[04:51:40.000 --> 04:51:49.000]   He'd been in the courtyard above, playing tug with shadow. She'd heard it first, stopping and staring, ears going flat to her head.
[04:51:49.000 --> 04:52:00.000]   "Budai was here with the cubs," Swain continued. "But he ran off when the fighting started, and then all the cubs were off as well, following him. We chased them, and then a man appeared in front of us."
[04:52:00.000 --> 04:52:16.000]   "He had rings in his beard," Sif said. "Aye," Swain said, eyes distant, remembering. "He was going to kill us, try to, but Budai killed him, ripped his throat out," Sif added matter-of-factly.
[04:52:16.000 --> 04:52:21.000]   "We picked up all the cubs between us and tricked Budai into following us back here."
[04:52:21.000 --> 04:52:27.000]   "How did you manage that?" Coen asked. They were silent a few moments.
[04:52:27.000 --> 04:52:35.000]   "I pinched one of the cubs, twisted her ear and made her cry," Halen said. He still felt guilty about that.
[04:52:35.000 --> 04:52:38.000]   "Budai followed us back here, and then we tied him up."
[04:52:38.000 --> 04:52:51.000]   "We were scared he'd get killed," Sif said. "You were right to do it," Coen said, stroking Sif's hair. "Budai would have been killed. I think he saved his life."
[04:52:51.000 --> 04:53:03.000]   Sif smiled at that, nodding. By now, all six cubs were rubbing up against Coen, sniffing, nibbling her clothing. One was tugging at her hair, and she absently pushed it off.
[04:53:03.000 --> 04:53:17.000]   "And since then," Swain went on, "we've just—stayed hidden. Every now and then, me or Halen sneak out for food and water. Pots is good at foraging for the cubs. He's always disappearing and coming back with something for them."
[04:53:17.000 --> 04:53:25.000]   Sif screwed her face up at that, and Halen remembered some of the things Pots had returned with—an arm, once. The cubs hadn't complained.
[04:53:25.000 --> 04:53:41.000]   "What's happening? Up there?" Swain asked Coen. "I'm a prisoner," Coen said. "I tend to the sick, wounded from the battle. Most have recovered or died, but there are still a few to tend to."
[04:53:41.000 --> 04:53:53.000]   "I meant Corbin," Swain said. "And Da?" "Wolf. I think he escaped," Coen said, and Swain and Sif physically drooped with relief.
[04:53:53.000 --> 04:53:58.000]   "Tahir. One of my shieldmen. And my friend."
[04:53:58.000 --> 04:54:04.000]   Tahir had driven Halen mad with his strict rules about where Halen could and couldn't go, what he could and couldn't do.
[04:54:04.000 --> 04:54:11.000]   "And his mam's old sayings. I wish I could see him and hear one of those sayings now."
[04:54:11.000 --> 04:54:24.000]   "Tahir?" He asked. "You're a shieldman?" "I don't know," Coen shrugged. "There was a lot of confusion. Many escaped," she said hopefully, "and they're in foreign, still fighting."
[04:54:24.000 --> 04:54:35.000]   "How do you know if you're a prisoner?" Halen asked suspiciously. He wanted good news, but he didn't want to be lied to, treated like a child.
[04:54:35.000 --> 04:54:42.000]   "A patrol of Vinthallen came back this morning. I saw them. They were more dead and wounded than the living amongst them."
[04:54:42.000 --> 04:54:54.000]   "Huh," Swain barked a laugh. "My da's worked for sure, no doubt," Coen said. "So what now?" Halen asked. "You could stay with us," Sif said.
[04:54:54.000 --> 04:55:08.000]   "I wish I could," Coen replied, "but I can't. I tend the sick and cannot abandon them. Besides, if Khaled has found me gone, he'd tear Drassil apart looking for me. He might find you."
[04:55:08.000 --> 04:55:19.000]   "Why would he do that?" Sif asked. "Because I am Corbin's kin, and he thinks Corbin will come for me. I am bait in a trap."
[04:55:19.000 --> 04:55:30.000]   "Will Corbin come?" Halen, Swain, and Sif asked together. "I don't know." Coen shook her head. "He did the last time, when I was Kalidus's prisoner."
[04:55:30.000 --> 04:55:38.000]   "But if it's a trap," Halen said, "then Corbin cannot come. He is our hope."
[04:55:38.000 --> 04:55:50.000]   Halen loved Corbin, admired him as the greatest warrior and leader the world had ever seen. "Then you have to escape, get out of here before Corbin comes for you."
[04:55:50.000 --> 04:56:08.000]   A smile twitched Coen's mouth, not lighthearted but serious and determined. "My thoughts exactly," she said. "It's just a how, that I'm struggling with. And now that I know you're here," she smiled, "you'll have to come with me, as Kalidus may find you in his search for me."
[04:56:08.000 --> 04:56:21.000]   That thought both excited and scared Halen. "To be away from this danger, the daily fear of being discovered and caught, but being away from our den, which has kept us safe and hidden a whole moon."
[04:56:21.000 --> 04:56:29.000]   "And, talking of being discovered, I should go back to the hospice, as the sun will be rising."
[04:56:29.000 --> 04:56:41.000]   Sif squeezed her harder, and Coen squeezed her in return. "I cannot tell you how happy I am to know that you're alive and here," Coen said, "and my Budai."
[04:56:41.000 --> 04:56:51.000]   She hugged the hound's neck, kissing him. "I'll return soon," she said, then made her goodbyes, ruffling the cub's heads and hugging Sif again.
[04:56:51.000 --> 04:56:56.000]   She gave Budai a stern order to stay and then backed into the darkness of the tunnel.
[04:56:56.000 --> 04:57:00.000]   Budai whined, but he did not follow her.
[04:57:00.000 --> 04:57:07.000]   Halen did though, and soon they were at the slope that led up to the courtyard. Moonlight showed them the way.
[04:57:07.000 --> 04:57:14.000]   "That smell," Coen said, wrinkling her nose as they stood in the darkness at the base of the slope.
[04:57:14.000 --> 04:57:18.000]   She was staring into the darkness of the tunnel where the smell was drifting from.
[04:57:18.000 --> 04:57:23.000]   "I recognize it," she said quietly, her expression changing.
[04:57:23.000 --> 04:57:28.000]   She looked scared. "Is that another tunnel?" she asked him.
[04:57:28.000 --> 04:57:36.000]   "It is," he said, remembering the first time he'd found this place, how he'd crawled that way first, eventually stopping and coming back.
[04:57:36.000 --> 04:57:38.000]   "It gets too narrow."
[04:57:38.000 --> 04:57:41.000]   Strangely, the cubs never went that way.
[04:57:41.000 --> 04:57:45.000]   "Good," Coen said, her expression relaxing.
[04:57:45.000 --> 04:57:54.000]   "Why? Because I know that smell, and I think there are draigs down there."
[04:57:54.000 --> 04:58:12.000]   Corbin sat upon a giant bear, hands gripping the high pommel of a saddle as it shambled along a fresh-built road that cut like a spear through the trees and undergrowth of fawn.
[04:58:12.000 --> 04:58:19.000]   Jael's road, which he built almost from the boundaries of Graham's hold to see him and his warband to the walls of Drasil.
[04:58:19.000 --> 04:58:27.000]   The bear's pace was surprisingly fast, eating up the leaves at a relentless pace throughout each day's travel.
[04:58:27.000 --> 04:58:32.000]   His legs were aching; the girth of a bear was unsuitable for his human legs.
[04:58:32.000 --> 04:58:37.000]   "I miss shield," he thought. "Not for the first time."
[04:58:37.000 --> 04:58:43.000]   The trees were thinning now, the terrain changing and more sunlight breaking through the canopy above.
[04:58:43.000 --> 04:58:48.000]   There was less vine and thorn on the ground, more grass and wildflowers.
[04:58:48.000 --> 04:58:54.000]   And then Corbin saw the stumps of trees, a whole vale harvested of timber.
[04:58:54.000 --> 04:58:57.000]   "We are close to Graham's hold."
[04:58:57.000 --> 04:59:04.000]   With every league that he had traveled, every day that had passed, he had felt his spirit sink.
[04:59:04.000 --> 04:59:10.000]   After Michal's revelation about the prophecy, Corbin had been in the deepest depths of despair.
[04:59:10.000 --> 04:59:17.000]   But focusing on the hope of being reunited with Cohen and his friends had given him the strength to endure.
[04:59:17.000 --> 04:59:21.000]   It had been something to live for, to fight for.
[04:59:21.000 --> 04:59:31.000]   Now he knew that, with every breath that he drew, he was being taken further away from them, if they still lived, and despondency had morphed into anger.
[04:59:31.000 --> 04:59:40.000]   Hated faces appeared in his mind. Calidus. Nathair. Ildair. Rin. Michal.
[04:59:40.000 --> 04:59:48.000]   He had thought about escape, but the simple truth was that, even if he could somehow break his bonds and slip away from his giant captors,
[04:59:48.000 --> 04:59:52.000]   he would not have been able to walk half a league because of his injuries.
[04:59:52.000 --> 04:59:58.000]   Even now, over a moon from when he'd been captured, they were still not fully recovered.
[04:59:58.000 --> 05:00:02.100]   Soon, though, perhaps.

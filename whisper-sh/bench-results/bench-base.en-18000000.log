[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.400]   The year 1144 of the Age of Exiles, Hound Moon.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.000]   There it is fell through the night air, waitless.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.200]   He caught glimpses of the tower of Brickhan.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.960]   Caledus is still smoldering outline at the window, then below, the river coming up to meet him.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.520]   He slammed into the water, the cold shocking the breath out of him.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.520]   He panicked, disorientated, realizing he didn't know which way was up.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.280]   All about him was darkness and ice.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.880]   Then something grabbed his hair, and he was surging upwards, breaking through the water
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.360]   in a burst of spray, and saw Alsion's pale broad phase staring back at him.
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.120]   "They will come hunting for us," the giant shouted over the roar of the river, as the
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.120]   current gripped them, sweeping them away from the thunder of warriors' feet crossing the
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.120]   bridge.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.760]   "Let the water take us far from them."
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.700]   Caledus saw the sense of that, though his hands and feet were already numbing from the
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.700]   cold.
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.800]   He put some effort into swimming, speeding his way from Brickhan, from Caledus, from the
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.160]   Khadashim.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.000]   The thought still jolted him like a blow.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.240]   They turned a bend in the river, and the fortress was gone, darkness enfolding them.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.160]   The soft weak sheen of dawn's gray light filtered down through the lattice of branches above,
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.760]   his varidus met Alsion's gaze, an unspoken agreement passing between them, as they both
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.560]   headed for the riverbank.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.960]   It was harder going, swimming across the current, and varidus realized how exhausted his body
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.440]   was, but eventually he felt silt beneath his feet, his hands grasping at reeds as he pulled
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.840]   himself out of the water and flopped onto his back, gasping, his limbs feeling lead-filled.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.680]   Turning, he saw Alsion on the bank, thirty or forty paces upriver from him, staggering
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.480]   wearily towards him before he slumped down beside him with a groan, water dripping from
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.680]   his drooping moustache.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.360]   "Thank you," Alsion said.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.160]   "For what?"
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.800]   "Everything, most of all, for helping my family escape Brickhan's dungeons."
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.320]   His wife and bear.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.240]   How long has he gone without seeing them?
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.080]   And what must he have suffered, knowing they were Caledus and Lycus' prisoners?
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:02.840]   And for destroying Caledus' effigy of me, Alsion continued, "You have set me free."
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.160]   He gave a shudder, followed by a smile, "A shadow is gone from my soul.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.840]   I feel reborn."
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.280]   "If you mean you feel weak as a newborn bear," Veridis muttered as he emptied his boot of
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.020]   water and tried to pull it back on, "then I feel the same."
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.840]   "That is not what I mean," the giant rumbled, regarding Veridis' with serious eyes.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.080]   "You set rainer and tame free, you set me free.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.760]   I owe you a debt beyond all imagining."
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.120]   "You're in no debt to me," Veridis said.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.280]   "I kicked the effigies into the fire on impulse, not really knowing what they were, or what
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.080]   power they held over you."
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.800]   But you suspected, "I," something that Fidele said.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.000]   He thought of Nathair's mother, hoped that she had made it to freedom along with his
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.520]   brother, Kralis, Maken and Albin.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.200]   And your wife and son, I set them free because it was the right thing to do.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.000]   It was not the choice.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.800]   "Ah, but there was true heart, there always is."
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.800]   Veridis shrugged.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.760]   "There is no debt between us.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.440]   You are my friend."
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.880]   One of my only friends, it has turned out.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.640]   His thought swept bitterly to Nathair, and the confession and revelations that had stunned
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.920]   Veridis.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:45.660]   He remembered Calidus' confession, that Nathair had slain Aquilus, his own father.
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.040]   Anger and shame twisted through him.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.240]   "There have been so many signs.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.440]   How can I have been deceived for so long?
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.400]   I am a fool."
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.640]   "How long?"
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.880]   Veridis asked him.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.080]   "How long have you been Calidus' prisoner?"
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.380]   Alcyon smiled withered, "16 years."
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.920]   "That is a long time."
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:21.280]   "It is," Alcyon clenched his fists, knuckles cracking, "I should have killed him."
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.720]   "To be fair, we both tried hard on that count.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.920]   I put a knife in his belly, threw him in a fire, and he shattered his chest with a wall
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.920]   hammer."
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.620]   "Cadoshim are hard to kill."
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.360]   "I'd have to agree.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.560]   Can he be killed?"
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.160]   "Maybe taking his head.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.840]   That is how the others are slain."
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.840]   "Others?"
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.040]   "The Jihar.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.720]   They are demon possessed by Kadoshim.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.360]   At Murias."
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.800]   Alcyon said to the question in Veridis' eyes, "The Jihar."
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.800]   Veridis muttered.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.520]   Shaking his head, "I've been so blind."
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:12.320]   "You trusted your king and your friend," Alcyon shrugged, "there are worse failings
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.320]   to have."
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.160]   "Are there?"
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.480]   "I have dedicated my life to a lie."
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.800]   They both sat in silence, water dripping from clothes and hair.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.320]   "What now?"
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.960]   Veridis said to himself.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.360]   "It feels as if my whole life has been dedicated to an affair in his cause."
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.120]   "What do I do now?"
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.480]   Alcyon regarded him gravely, and poked his chest with a thick finger.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.000]   "What does your heart tell you?"
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.400]   "I will not trust it."
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.120]   "Look where it has led me thus far," Veridis said sourly.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.520]   "Your eyes are open now."
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.080]   Veridis sucked in a deep breath, felt exhaustion seeping through him.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.360]   "What would you do?"
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.080]   He asked the giant.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.880]   "Find my king, my reiner, and tain."
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.440]   He smiled as he said their names.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.440]   "Kyn?"
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.720]   "My father is slain, as is my brother Ector.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.280]   Only Krelis is left."
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.280]   Suddenly he was desperate to see his older brother.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:32.680]   "Find our kin," he echoed, "a good place to start."
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.120]   Something squawked, a handful of woodpigeons suddenly bursting from the trees and flapping
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.440]   noisily overhead.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.560]   "We should move."
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.040]   "We need cover."
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:48.240]   "I, to the trees," Veridis said, as he stood suppressing a groan.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.760]   They were half way across the clearing when Alcyon stopped abruptly, staring back along
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.560]   the riverbank.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.800]   Alcyon's appeared around a distant bend on the track, shadows in the half-light that
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.480]   fawns canopy created.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.920]   Black shadows with curved swords sheathed across their backs.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.360]   "Cada-shim," Alcyon growled.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.040]   Veridis counted at least seven of them, moving quickly, a loping, ground-eating pace like
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.400]   a pack of wolfen.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.200]   They were spread in a half-circle between the riverbank and the tree-line.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.800]   They are hunting us, have been running all night long following the river in search of
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.320]   our trail.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.460]   One of the figures paused, the others rippling to a halt about it.
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:39.720]   It lifted its head as if tasting the air, then gave an ululating howl and leapt forwards
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.120]   a new energy in its stride.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.720]   They've caught our scent.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.960]   Veridis felt a jolt of fear.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.400]   He'd faced giants, drags, warbands.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.200]   But somehow knowing that the demons of the other world were hunting him sent a cold shock
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.000]   of fear tingling through his veins.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.480]   "Cada-shim," Alcyon said, "my enemy."
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.000]   Alcyon filled his mind.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.560]   An image of the man he had thought counsellor and ally emerging from the fire in Brikan's
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.640]   tower, flame-reaved and snarling.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.200]   He has corrupted an affair and has deceived me for so long.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.880]   He is the author of this evil.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:30.080]   Fear morphed into a cold rage and he reached for his sword, lips twisting.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.120]   "Move," Alcyon grunted and broke into a run.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.760]   Veridis resisted for a moment, inexplicably wanting to stand and fight these creatures,
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:45.960]   but Alcyon dragged him along and in a heartbeat they were only a few strides from the tree-line.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.400]   He realised the giant had no weapon.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:54.040]   No Warhammer or battle act strapped across his back, no sword or dagger at his hip.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.400]   They crashed through the first layer of undergrowth and were immediately enveloped by a twilight
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.920]   world of shadow and thorn.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:08.240]   Alcyon forged ahead, grunting as branches snapped upon his rock-like torso, thorns whipping
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.840]   at Veridis, vines tangling about his boots.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.880]   It seemed a long time, Veridis only heard his own heart thumping the rasp of his breath,
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.160]   the thud of Alcyon's feet.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.240]   Then there were sounds behind him, faint at first, like the rustle of wind through foliage,
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:30.600]   but soon louder, keening cries were floating about him.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.800]   They splashed through a stream, something sinuous slithered beneath Veridis's feet, making
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.800]   him stumble.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.020]   "They're almost upon us," he gasped to Alcyon.
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.880]   Better to turn and fight, hold a sword in my fist than die running.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:51.600]   "I know," the giant said, turning, chest-heaving.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.240]   Veridis drew his sword as they put their backs to a huge tree, the stream before them, and
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.800]   waited.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:03.760]   Forms flitted through the gloom, emerging from a curtain of shadows and thick foliage.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:10.040]   One was a long way ahead of the others, clothed in the dark mail of the jihar, pale-skinned,
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.560]   dark veins making a tapestry of its flesh.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.840]   It saw them and leapt the stream, arms reaching for Veridis, not even bothering to draw its
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.840]   sword.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:26.800]   "Remember, you must take their heads," Alcyon grunted, as he pushed away from the tree,
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.280]   hurling himself into the oncoming countership with bone-crushing power.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.720]   The two fell to the ground.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.560]   Veridis hurtled forwards, sword-raised, hacking two-handed at the Khadashim's arm, its hand
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:44.680]   spinning away, blood-like oil pumping languidly from the stump, then the two forms were rolling
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.040]   together again.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:52.040]   Alcyon growled in pain, then he was on his knees, arms wrapped about the Khadashim's torso,
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.640]   pinning its arms at its side.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.520]   The creature's head writhed, veins bulging as it strained to break free, Alcyon's face
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.120]   turning purple with the effort, his locked fingers slowly pulling apart.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:11.920]   "What are you, waiting for?" the giant rasped, and Veridis swung his sword, chopping into
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.240]   the creature's neck.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:19.280]   Dark blood spurted from the half-severed neck, the Khadashim screeching with fury, Alcyon
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.640]   roared with the strain of holding the creature.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.680]   Veridis wrenched his sword free, and swung again.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:31.960]   The Khadashim's head flew through the air, landing with a splash in the stream.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:37.720]   Its body slumped, legs drumming as Alcyon fell away and rolled clear.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:44.560]   A black, eye-core-like mist flowed from the Khadashim's neck, hissing and swirling, gathering
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.800]   above its body, forming a human shape with tattered wings of smoke spread about it, and
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.880]   red eyes glowing like coals at its heart.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.680]   Veridis stared.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:02.480]   It screamed savagely, then it was melting away, torn and dispersed by a slight breeze.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.040]   "What the hell?"
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:10.760]   Veridis gasped, "Down!" Alcyon yelled as he surged up from the ground, a fist slamming
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:17.040]   into the jaw of a leaping Khadashim, hurling it spinning into the undergrowth.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:23.440]   Almost as soon as it hit the ground, it was back on its feet, twisting like a feral cat.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.800]   Veridis hefted his sword, spread his legs to meet the impact and then something crunched
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.640]   into his side, sending him flying through the air another Khadashim's arms locked around
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.760]   his waist.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:40.200]   He caught a glimpse of Alcyon standing, Khadashim swarming upon him, then Veridis was slamming
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.600]   into the ground.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:47.240]   Pain exploded in his shoulder, and his sword skittered away.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:52.360]   He rolled, punched at his attacker, for a moment staring into its black, soulless eyes, then
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.520]   they were sliding into the stream, the Khadashim beneath him, his hands fastening about its
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:01.960]   neck, squeezing, seeking to crush the life from the black-eyed abomination.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:07.240]   It bucked and kicked like a wild stallion, thrashing a tempest amidst the stream water,
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.360]   but Veridis would not let go.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.920]   He felt its strength ebbing, some of its vitality fading, then hands gripped him from
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:21.600]   behind, dragging him backwards, his fingers slipping as he was hauled to the bank.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.960]   Veridi Khadashim stood over him, drawing its sword from its back as the one from the stream
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.360]   splashed into view.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:33.200]   He rolled and saw a handful of Khadashim circling Alcyon, who would fall into one knee, the giant
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.320]   bleeding from a dozen wounds.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.840]   Veridis tried to drag himself through the mud towards his friend.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.320]   Another Khadashim was held in Alcyon's arms, he had one hand gripping its jaw, the other
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.920]   wrapped about its chest.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:52.040]   With a savage wrench, Alcyon heaved, Veridis heard the Khadashim's neck break, then the
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.880]   sound of flesh tearing, Alcyon screaming his defiance as he ripped the Khadashim's head
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.240]   from its shoulders.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:05.360]   He flung the corpse to the ground as the black mist boiled from the dead creatures wound.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:11.960]   A searing pain lanced through Veridis's leg, a Khadashim blade scoring along his thigh.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.160]   He dropped to the ground, looked back at the two Khadashim on the stream bank.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.400]   They were following him, toying with him.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.880]   The one with the drawn sword slashed his blade across Veridis's upheld forearm, a new cut
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.520]   burning like fire.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:33.320]   "Think will bleed you a while," the Khadashim said, leering with pale lips.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.880]   "Pay you back for the chase you've led us."
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.080]   It should not end like this.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.680]   Frustration gave Veridis a last surge of strength, and he rolled to his feet, pushed
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.120]   himself upright.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:54.680]   The Khadashim before him grinned, then paused, cocking its head to one side.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.960]   Figures burst out of the gloom.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.060]   Veridis's hopes rose and then fell as he saw the newcomers were dressed in black breast
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:04.800]   plates with silver eagles on their chests.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.040]   Eagle guard.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:10.400]   No doubt sent by Nefair to make sure that his monsters complete their task.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:17.680]   Ten, twelve, fifteen more men, one of them tall and wide.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.960]   Veridis blinked, something familiar.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:27.880]   Well met, little brother, the big man bellowed, grinning wildly.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:34.680]   A moment's confusion followed swiftly by elation, "Krellis!"
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.680]   Then Krellis and his men were attacking the Khadashim, Krellis taking her head in one
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.360]   great swing of his longsword.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.200]   Another warrior swept into view.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:49.160]   This one not dressed as a man of tenor brow, but gripping a knife in each hand.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:54.880]   He joined Krellis, and together they attacked the Khadashim before Veridis.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:00.760]   McKean and Krellis.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:05.920]   Chapter 2 Nefair.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:12.200]   Nefair stood in the great hall of Drasil and stared at the giant skeleton on its throne.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:18.720]   The bones of the ribcage surrounded a thick shafted spear, the wood, dark and pale vained,
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:25.760]   only a hint of black iron of the blade visible, the rest buried in the great tree of Drasil.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:32.600]   So that is scald, high king of the giants, and that is the starstone spear.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:40.820]   Scald, the last man to rule a united empire where giants and men live together in peace.
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:44.040]   Will I be the next to unite this shattered world?
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:50.240]   The skeleton was mottled yellow and brown, ancient, the brow of the skull broad and thick
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:55.360]   eye sockets, black holes that seemed to stare at Nefair, questioning him.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.600]   Are you worthy?
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.040]   Are you capable?
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:07.800]   Besides, history shall be my judge, nothing and no one else.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:16.280]   The hand touched his shoulder, Caesus was standing at the head of three-score eagle-guard.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:20.520]   The young warrior had been recently promoted to high captain of the fair's war-band, now
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:30.600]   that Veridis was gone, ah, Veridis, are you dead or alive, old friend?
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:36.080]   It does not seem right that you are not beside me to share in this great victory.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.800]   He had been informed of Veridis's betrayal, his attempt on Caledus's life, and he and
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.040]   Althian's escape.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:49.960]   Veridis, how could you abandon me, break your oath to me?
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:54.400]   He looked at the white scars on the palm of his hand, one of them made as a blood oath
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:00.080]   of brotherhood to Veridis on a moonlit hillside in Tenebrel.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:05.560]   It felt like a lot of time ago, words and promises spoken by different people.
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:10.760]   "My king," Caesus said, "it is Caledus."
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.840]   He asks for you.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:18.440]   Nefair looked back at the skeleton one last time, then turned and strode through the huge
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.680]   chamber.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:25.160]   The dead were still being cleared from the battle of the day before.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:33.800]   But staying the stone floor, mounds of corpses lay in stinking piles, hundreds of them—Caddishim,
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:40.600]   Jihar, Vinthalan, Eagleguard, Benothi giants, many others.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:44.940]   The cost of taking Drassil had been high, higher than he would have imagined considering
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.720]   that the element of surprise had been on their side.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:53.160]   But victory is victory.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:58.500]   The fortress is ours, the back of our enemy, broken.
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:04.000]   Though many had escaped, reports were coming in of pitched battles still being fought beyond
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.600]   the walls of Drassil.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:11.360]   Nefair glanced at his right as he passed an open trap-door as wide as the gates of Jerelin,
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:15.400]   and the dark stain of blood on the stone before it.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.040]   Mycals blood.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:22.960]   The Ben Ellim's head, now adorned a spear set in the ground of the courtyard before the
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.360]   gates of Drassil.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.800]   It was not alone.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.840]   But what of Corbin, their bright star?
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.880]   Where is he?
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.880]   He glared mistrustfully into the yawning dark of the tunnel, knew then Michael had chosen
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:42.160]   to stand and fight there to gain time for many who escaped into the tunnel.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.760]   Was Corbin one of them?
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.980]   There had been no reports of Corbin being seen during the battle.
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.080]   Had he even been here?
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:55.400]   It had been a long night, and Nefair felt a greater weariness settling upon him than
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.320]   he had ever known before.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.720]   Sazer snapped an order behind him, an eagle guard spread to either side, forming a protective
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.720]   column.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:11.720]   "Drassil is not yet secure," Sazer said, in replying to Nefair's inquiring look.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.200]   The courtyard also bore the signs of yesterday's battle.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:21.880]   Bodies scattered all about flies buzzing, the Metallica Roma of blood everywhere.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:27.320]   For an instant, Nefair thought he saw a wolf in cub tugging at the leg of a dead caddishim,
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.960]   but looking back realized it was a small white-furred dog.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:36.600]   They turned a corner in a street, and Nefair glimpsed the towering outer walls of Drassil
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:41.640]   beyond the layers of stone buildings latticed with thick branches.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.800]   This is a truly remarkable place.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.360]   Branches soared above him as thick as towers, with buildings of stone and iron wrapped about
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.960]   them bound tighter than leather armour.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.720]   It looks almost alive.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:02.920]   The tree, the bones, the fortress, its flesh.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.320]   The rasp of a sword drawn from its scabbard drew his attention, and he glimpsed the black
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.480]   clothed warrior hurtling from the shadows of a doorway.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:17.320]   Abruptly, Sazer's was yelling as more dark figures emerged, iron glinting.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:23.880]   The eagle guard moved, shields thudding together around the fair obscuring his view.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:28.880]   Blood sprayed, spattering Nefair's face as an eagle guard before him collapsed.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:34.160]   A black clothed jihar slipped into the gap carved in the shield wall, surging towards
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.160]   Nefair.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:42.000]   Nefair drew his sword, fear and rage, his constant companions, igniting within him.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.760]   The shouts and screams are battle faded, his world contracting to the jihar warrior before
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.760]   him.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:53.120]   A woman, her dark-skinned face all sharp bones, almost fragile looking.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:23:00.320]   "Truth and courage!" she yelled, curved sword rising.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:04.840]   There was an explosion of sparks as their weapons met, the power of the jihar's strike making
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:10.920]   the tendons of his wrist shriek, shuddering on into his arm and shoulder.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:16.620]   He pushed forwards, knowing to retreat was to die, tried to move within her guard, use
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:20.480]   his short sword where her longer blade would hinder her.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:26.200]   They collided, limbs tangling as both crashed to the ground, wrestling, punching, kicking
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.120]   and biting at each other as they rolled back and forth across the stone street with a battle
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.080]   raging all about them.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:37.960]   The jihar struck a glancing blow that made his vision blur, then her knee crunched into
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:43.160]   his groin and he slumped, pain exploding, pulsing through him in savage waves, draining
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.440]   his strength.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:49.960]   She pulled herself free and half-rode as he coughed into the cold stone, tried to rise,
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:53.920]   knew if he didn't, he was dead.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:58.800]   Fear and rage sparked inside him, sent new energy coursing through his veins.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.120]   I'll not die here.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:08.400]   The jihar stood over him, sword raised, her eyes bright with victory.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:12.400]   Then a form crashed into her, throwing her to the ground.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:18.600]   She started to rise and a boot slammed into her jaw, sent her crashing back down.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:23.480]   The figure was blurred, a buzzing cloud swirling about it.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.500]   Hands gripped him and pulled him upright, says as his concerned face appeared, blood
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:31.380]   sheeting from a long cut across his forehead.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:35.140]   Nithair looked past him, saw his rescuer pull a sword from a scabbard upon its back and
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.900]   raised it over the unconscious jihar.
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.300]   "A kaddishim."
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.300]   "No!"
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.220]   Nithair called.
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:46.860]   The figure's head turned to look at him, the buzzing cloud parting.
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:52.220]   "Flies," Nithair realized, recognizing the kaddishim.
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.340]   "No, Legion.
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.100]   I want her alive."
[00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:01.020]   The kaddishim regarded him for a moment with cold black eyes.
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.940]   "Better, dead," it said.
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:08.260]   "I want her alive," Nithair snapped.
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.780]   "Kaddishim just may have questions."
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:18.180]   "Dead, after then," the kaddishim said, then sheathing its sword.
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:22.460]   "Kaddishim just wants you."
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:27.060]   The flesh of its face and neck rippled, seeming to move of its own accord as if some
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.820]   something were locked within, trying to get out.
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:34.500]   About them, the battle seemed almost done.
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:39.940]   Nithair scanned the street, counted nearly a score of his eagle guard dead to five or
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.420]   six of their jihar attackers.
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:46.700]   "This part of Drassel is supposed to have been cleared," he snarled.
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.900]   "How did they get in here?"
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:53.020]   He looked down at the unconscious jihar's form at Legion's feet.
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:58.020]   "Bring her," Nithair said, as he marched away.
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:03.500]   As Nithair entered the courtyard before Drassel's gates, he heard a rumbling growl reverberate
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:07.020]   from one of the many stables that edged the courtyard.
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:11.180]   He looked fondly at the doors that contained his drag.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:15.940]   Kallida stood before the closed gates of Drassel to either side of him were a host of spears
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:20.660]   driven into the ground, most of them adorned with a head.
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:25.460]   Their handful of Vinfalan warriors were planting new spears into the ground while behind them
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:29.700]   Kalishim prowled into the courtyard's shadows.
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:36.340]   Before Kallida snelt a ragged group of people, bound at wrist and ankle, over 300 prisoners
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.980]   from yesterday's battle.
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.380]   Above them, eagle guards stood upon Drassel's walls.
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.740]   My warriors.
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:50.420]   They were easily the best disciplined troops amongst those that had stormed Drassel.
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:55.620]   The Kallida and many of Lycus's Vinfalan were involved in the pursuit of their scattered
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:27:01.700]   enemy out beyond Drassel's walls, but Nithair suspected that most by far were ranging throughout
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:05.340]   the forest, looting and drinking.
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:10.340]   The Kallida and other things, such as eating their victims.
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.900]   Lycus was standing behind Kalishis.
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:19.740]   A dozen Vinfalan ranged about him, hard-looking men, bodies lean and muscular, skin, weathered
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.460]   and scarred.
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.540]   Lycus lifted a waterskin to his mouth and took a long drink.
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:30.140]   I'd wager it's not water that he's drinking.
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.100]   The Vinfalan saw him approaching and nodded, agreeating.
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:38.500]   Nithair hid his disgust, him and my mother.
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:43.180]   "Ah, Nithair," Kalishis said.
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:48.700]   He raised an eyebrow at the blood on Nithair's face, then saw Legion dragging the Jihar warrior
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.780]   across the courtyard by her ankle.
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:56.900]   "Kallida's?" Nithair said, with a dip of his head.
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:00.220]   His old counselor was not looking his best.
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:04.220]   Part of his face was burned charcoal black and peeling.
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:08.780]   Silver hair was growing in tufts from patches on his head, elsewhere singed to stubble or
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:09.940]   burned clear.
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:15.660]   "It would appear that the streets of Drassel are not yet cleared of our enemy," Nithair
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.460]   said sourly.
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:21.220]   As Legion dumped the Jihar warrior in front of Kalishis.
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:26.100]   She groaned, pushing herself to her knees as Legion's hand clamped on her shoulder,
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.100]   holding her before Kalishis.
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.800]   "What is your name, child?"
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:36.040]   Kalishis asked, regarding her with his cold eyes.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:40.180]   She spat blood at Kalishis' feet and glowed up at him.
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:46.100]   "Ilta," the Jihar said, "and I am no child."
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:52.500]   "Well, Ilta, I shall ask you the same question that I have just put to your comrades."
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.300]   "Where is Corbin?"
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:29:01.580]   "You will see him soon enough," a voice said from amongst the prisoners.
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.940]   "He will come for you."
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:09.660]   "And when he does," said Ilta, as she turned her head to look from Kalishis to Nithair
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:13.260]   and like us, "he will kill you all."
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:17.380]   "He is a boy, a puppet.
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:23.500]   Your ill master is already slain," Kalishis said angrily, sweeping her hand towards Michael's
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.500]   head.
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.420]   "You are wrong," Ilta said.
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:29.580]   "Corbin is our Lord.
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.820]   He slew your best, Sumor, in single combat.
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.220]   We all saw it.
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.820]   He will do the same to you."
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.620]   "Sumor," Kalishis frowned.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:44.500]   "I saw his head decorating your gates."
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.100]   Corbin killed him.
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:52.220]   The prisoners' voice called out again, one vaguely familiar to Nithair.
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:58.580]   The figure straightened amongst the captives, black hair hanging lank about her face.
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:02.820]   He took Sumor's head, and he will take yours, too.
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:06.460]   "Ah, Cohen.
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:12.020]   I want nothing more than for him to come and try," Kalishis said with a sigh, his expression
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:16.100]   mocking, but Nithair limped something else in his eyes.
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:17.100]   "Doubt?"
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:24.260]   "But so far, he does not seem inclined to do so," Kalishis continued.
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:28.660]   "Perhaps a message will speed him to us."
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.540]   He looked to the Calichim.
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:38.140]   "Legion, choose one prisoner, and impale them upon a spear," he ordered.
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:43.780]   Legion drabs Cohen and pulled her, struggling towards a spear, "not her," Kalishis said,
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:46.660]   with a wave of his hand.
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:48.940]   Legion grabbed another prisoner.
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:52.100]   He was a man of isyltyred by the look of him.
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:56.380]   The Calichim hoisted him effortlessly into the air and brought him down slowly upon the
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:59.180]   upright spear.
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:02.120]   Then the screaming began.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:08.620]   When it was over, the prisoner was skewered like a squirrel, ready for the cookfire.
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:13.980]   He was writhing upon the spear, blood pooling about his feet, screaming himself to oblivion.
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:17.580]   Nithair resisted the urge to cover his ears.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:24.580]   "On your feet," Kalishis said to Ilta, "Go and tell Korriban what is happening to
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:32.260]   his followers what I am doing. Tell him I will not stop until he has faced me."
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:37.860]   Legion pushed her stumbling forwards as, with a rumble, the gates opened.
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:43.980]   She looked back once, and then ran, the gates slamming behind her.
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:48.460]   Calidas barked in order and the remaining captives were led away.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:53.980]   Cohen caught Nithair's eye as she walked in line, hatred pouring from her.
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:57.660]   "He must talk soon," Kalidas said to Nithair and Lycos.
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:01.980]   "Hi, son, in the great hall."
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.660]   Then he was striding away.
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.900]   Lycos raised an eyebrow and offered Nithair his water-skin.
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:13.940]   Without thinking, Nithair took it and drank, then coughed, almost choking on the contents.
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:22.060]   "Is that... mead?" Lycos finished for him, found their dozen wagons with barrels full
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.460]   of the stuff.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:29.740]   Nithair handed it back to him, and Lycos walked away, chuckling to himself, his vinthalant
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.300]   following him.
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:38.420]   Nithair headed for the wide stairs that scaled Drasil's walls and climbed to the top, stopping
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:42.980]   above the great gates where he stared out at the world beyond.
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:48.180]   A wide plain circled the fortress, clear blue sky bathing the ground in sunshine before
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:52.140]   the great trees of fawn blotted it from view.
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:57.380]   He caught a glimpse of Ilta just before she disappeared into the tree-line.
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:02.060]   Behind him, he heard the footsteps of Caesus and his eagle-guard stopping a respectful distance
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.140]   away.
[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:08.740]   The screams of the impaled in the courtyard were much fainter up here, fading to a pathetic
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.840]   mewling.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:14.260]   He wished he would just die.
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:17.380]   How have I allowed myself to come to this?
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.260]   This is for the greater good.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:23.140]   For me to win the war, Corbin must die.
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:28.060]   To bring peace to the banish lands, Corbin must die.
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:32.900]   He felt his resolve stir, but still the screams wormed their way into his head, reminding
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:37.980]   him of other battles, other deaths in the name of this great cause.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:45.380]   And now I follow the path of Karushim, of demons, of Asroth himself.
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:50.800]   He remembered Caledus's words to him in Murias, so persuasive.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:55.780]   It had all been so logical when Caledus explained it, made sense of the alliances, the lies,
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:59.940]   deception upon deception, heaped in a great pile.
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:04.900]   But the truth is simpler, a voice seemed to whisper inside his mind.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.940]   Deep down, he knew.
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:12.640]   It was more basic when all was stripped away, Caledus's persuasive arguments and philosophical
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:17.420]   debates on good and evil, right and wrong, the abstract meanings that were attached
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:22.900]   to names, politics, power struggles, who deserved what.
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:27.120]   The honest answer was much simpler than any of those meandering debates, and one that
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:32.660]   had been clearly reinforced by his brief struggle with the Jihar warrior before him.
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:36.200]   I don't want to lose.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:43.600]   Chapter Three Coraline
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:49.560]   Coraline sat with her back to a tree, staring into the dawn gloom of fawn, absently twirling
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:52.820]   a knife between her fingers.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:56.180]   Behind her were the sleeping forms of three score or so of the survivors within she had
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:59.020]   fled Drassel.
[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:04.820]   Amongst them was Brinner, grey hair poking from beneath her cloak, beside her the bolts
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:09.240]   of Pharrell and Lafe curled close together.
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:15.360]   She glimpsed the Jihar, Akar, standing guard on the far side of their camp.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:19.840]   Exhaustion hovered at the fringes of her consciousness, and in so many ways it would
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.840]   be wonderful to lose herself in the nothingness of sleep.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.840]   But she couldn't.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:31.160]   Her mind was reeling, a whirlwind of grief, fear and rage as fractured moments of the previous
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.560]   day played out in her mind's eye.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.680]   Most of them all, though.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.220]   Everything kept returning to one thought, circling.
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:43.060]   Where is Corbin?
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:47.940]   The fog of Titan has crept upon her again, a relentless assault, but she knew that sleep
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.140]   would not come.
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:53.780]   The shock and horror of yesterday's battle was still too present.
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:58.860]   There was a soft footfall from behind, and a figure came to stand beside her.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:35:59.860]   Gar.
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:05.340]   The lord of the Jihar looked at her, lines of worry etched upon his usually unreadable
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:07.140]   face.
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:12.140]   He was clothed in a shirt of dark chain mail, splattered with grime and blood.
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:16.300]   His curved sword sheathed across his back, a single bladed throwing axe hanging on his
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.380]   belt.
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.560]   Even he was not free of injury.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:24.140]   A blood-stained bandage was tied around his forehead.
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:29.700]   Storm is with him, Gar said, as if he could read her thoughts.
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:34.820]   "They must be as plain to read upon my face as our his."
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.620]   Storm.
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.220]   That was a measure of comfort.
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:43.740]   Corbin knew that the wolfen was a better guardian than a dozen shieldmen, but still,
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:48.820]   "We will find him," Gar said.
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:52.940]   Corbin had seen the familiar scuff marks of Storm's claws in the tunnel, which was why
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.420]   they had exited at this spot.
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:01.460]   After a brief search, she'd found more tracks, leading to the brow of the slope, but darkness
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:05.420]   has settled upon them, and no matter how frustrating it was pointless to stumble around
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.420]   in the dark.
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:10.740]   But where can Corbin be?
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:16.540]   He must have heard the din of battle from Drassil, even if he were this far away.
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:20.020]   The thoughts rose unbidden in her mind.
[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:25.020]   The one thought she'd refused to acknowledge throughout the long dark of night.
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:27.700]   What if he is slain?
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:31.500]   What else could have kept him from returning to Drassil?
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:36.460]   She felt a worm of fear wriggling through her belly, but refused to consider it.
[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:38.300]   He lives.
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.180]   He must.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:42.860]   She nodded, and stood.
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:48.820]   She eating her knife, a myriad of cuts, bruises, and strains, aching for attention.
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:50.300]   She ignored them all.
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:54.140]   "We need to go," she said.
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:58.020]   "I," Gar agreed.
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.420]   He continued to stare at the trap-door.
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:06.660]   "I had hoped that Michael would find us, that he escaped."
[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:10.020]   Corbin remembered her last sight of the Benelium.
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:14.220]   Wielding his sword two handed, feet planted before the entrance to the tunnel in Drassil's
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:18.860]   great hall as they had retreated into its shadows.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:23.580]   Swaths of blood had surrounded him as he swung his sword in deadly arcs, holding back
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:27.500]   the enemy, protecting them, purchasing them time to escape.
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:33.620]   "He would have come by now, if he could," Corbin said.
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:36.780]   Gar sighed and nodded.
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:41.820]   Corbin cocked her head, listening, staring down the hill.
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:46.300]   Something was moving in the undergrowth, heading towards the trap-door.
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.220]   Gar saw it too, and without words the two of them separated, slipping into the shadows
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:54.140]   as they quietly surrounded the intruder.
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:39:00.020]   Bushes rustled, a twig snapped, and Corbin caught a glimpse of dark hair.
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:03.580]   She knew it wasn't Corbin, even he isn't that clumsy.
[00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:10.020]   A figure burst from the undergrowth, a young man clad in leather and wool, his dark hair
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:14.620]   tousled and a scabbing cut marking his forehead.
[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:19.500]   He started, at the sight of her, fumbled for a weapon and his belt, his eyes widening.
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:24.660]   "I know you," Corbin said, though she didn't remember his name.
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:32.500]   "Your dar is Attilius," a competent unassuming warrior, Attilius had been a slave oarsman
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.420]   on a Vinthallonship.
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:38.780]   The lad nodded, his lip trembling.
[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:39.780]   "Pax?
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:42.540]   What are you doing here?"
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:47.860]   Gar said, stepping silently from the shadows, making the young warrior jump again.
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:54.620]   "You must come quickly," Pax blurted, "My dar, Corbin, giants!"
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.100]   "Corbin?"
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:40:00.060]   Corbin hissed, "I, we must go."
[00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:05.060]   Tears were spilling down Pax's cheeks now, tracing tracks through blood and grime.
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:08.060]   "He's dead."
[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:12.620]   Corbin froze, feeling as if a fist had just clamped around her heart.
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:16.540]   "I ran," Pax said.
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:21.460]   He began to shake, an involuntary twitching that quickly became more violent.
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:24.580]   "Where is Corbin?"
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:29.540]   Corbin asked, trying to control the panic leaking through her, reaching out to grab the now-sobing
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:32.340]   boy and shake the sense from him.
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:37.540]   "Hold," Gar said, putting a hand upon her arm.
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:40.980]   "Pax, you must tell us as clearly as you can.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:44.940]   Where is Corbin and your dar, what happened?"
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:50.060]   Others were coming down the hill now, Corbin glimpsed Dath in colour, a handful of jihar,
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.060]   lathe looming behind them.
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:58.880]   "We heard, fighting, new Corbin was out there," Pax began, haltingly, "We found him, facing
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.380]   giants and bears."
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:01.380]   "What?"
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:04.740]   But there were no giants beneath their addressel.
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:10.940]   "Dar, he threw a spear at a giant, then we all ran, we thought we'd lost him, then—"
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:14.060]   "Go on," Gar said.
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:18.580]   The whole group was gathered around them now, listing in absolute silence.
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:28.220]   "They came from nowhere, my dar," he rubbed his eyes, blew out a long breath.
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:34.220]   "They, killed my dar," Corbin told me to run to fetch help.
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.500]   "When did this happen?"
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:40.060]   Gar asked, not able to keep the urgency from his voice.
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:44.820]   "Yesterday, after high sun before sunset—"
[00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:47.660]   Pax's face had grown paler as he spoke.
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.140]   Now he looked like a corpse.
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:53.380]   "I ran, I fell, hit my head."
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.780]   He raised a hand to the cut on his brow.
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:42:02.140]   "When I came to, it was dark, I've been trying to find my way since then."
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.780]   "Take us, now," Gar said.
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.100]   "I will try," Pax nodded.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:13.140]   "I became lost for a while, but I know it was that direction."
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:17.900]   Gar barked orders and then they were moving, Corbin taking the lead with Pax, Gar jogging
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:21.900]   beside the lad, a steadying hand on his arm.
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:28.220]   Corbin stormed, facing giants, alone, yesterday.
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:34.460]   She sent a silent prayer to Elion, one of many that she had made over the last half-day.
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:37.260]   Let them still live.
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.060]   Corbin was the first to enter the Glade.
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:45.780]   At its far end was a sudden ridge, and beyond it the sound of a fast-flowing river.
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:52.820]   The smell hit her first, the metallic tang of blood and decay, death.
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:57.420]   Flies were buzzing in great clouds about bodies heaped on the floor.
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:03.100]   She counted three giant corpses on the ground, and a tillius pinned to a great oak by a giant's
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:04.740]   axe.
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.500]   She could not see Corbin or storm.
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:12.900]   She ran to the first giant, who was on his back, a hole in his belly, throat cleanly cut,
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:17.660]   his wrist bearing the telltale, ripping wounds of the wolfen.
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:23.100]   Corbin moved on, dimly aware of others spilling into the Glade behind her, the sound of Pax's
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:29.140]   sobs as he dropped to his knees before his dar, Gar's presence at her shoulder.
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:34.500]   The other two giants were close together, the ground trampled, rutted, dark and still
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.220]   sticky with blood.
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:42.940]   Corbin's throat had been ripped out by storm, the flesh mangled and torn.
[00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:46.340]   Here's not here, nor storm.
[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:49.980]   The relief was a physical thing, though she knew their absence did not mean that they
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:55.620]   were safe or even alive, but it was clear they had fought here and won.
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:59.020]   They slew three giants.
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:01.700]   She felt a flush of pride at that feat.
[00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:05.540]   Knew that it would be a story told around the campfire this very night, adding to the
[00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:10.260]   tales that were growing up around Corbin and his wolfen companion.
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.860]   The other giant lay upon his front.
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:18.740]   Gar and Corbin tried to turn him over together, flies buzzed angrily, the huge warriors dead
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:21.500]   wait like a boulder.
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:26.020]   Farrell and Lath joined them, and together they rolled the giant, the stench of corruption
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:29.460]   and decay wafting up to them as they disturbed the body.
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:36.560]   The E is of the Choton clan, Lath spat, as they stood instead of the dead giant.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.060]   What are they doing here?
[00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:43.860]   Corbin's eyes were drawn to the glint of leather and iron amidst the congealed blood.
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:48.380]   She bent and wrapped a fist around the hilt of a sword buried deep in the giant's thigh,
[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:50.820]   angled upwards into its groin.
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:56.060]   It came free with a sucking sound, and she lifted it for them all to see, the pommel shaped
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:58.420]   like a howling wolfen.
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:02.580]   The relief she'd felt fled, replaced by the crushing weight of fear.
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:10.820]   "That ban sword," Dath said as he joined them, "color a pace behind him."
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:14.740]   Corbin stared at them a moment, caught a wave of sympathy for them.
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:18.580]   They'd been weighed less than two nights.
[00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:21.380]   Gar took the sword from her and stared at it.
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:25.380]   I watched Ban's Dar give him this blade.
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:30.340]   In the Rowan field at Duncarig, Farrell said, "I remember it."
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:34.220]   "And I," Dath muttered.
[00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:39.500]   Corbin turned away, her eyes scanning the ground, searching for any sign.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:46.500]   He is not here, Storm is not here, they escaped, but they did not make their way back to Drassel.
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.660]   Why?
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:51.620]   Brinner was on her knees beside the giant.
[00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:56.100]   The old healer had a file in one hand, a knife in the other that she was using to scrape blood
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.980]   from the trampled grass.
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:03.940]   One side of Brinner's face was still an angry red, seared by the explosions she had generated
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:07.740]   that had rocked the chamber in Drassel yesterday.
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:13.220]   Whatever benefit Brinner thought the giant's blood would bring, she was welcome to it.
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:18.140]   As Corbin scammed the rest of the clearing, her eyes caught a patch of crushed grass spattered
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:19.980]   with blood.
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:25.860]   It was close to the edge of the glade, leading to a sheer drop to the river below, as if
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:29.100]   something were dragged.
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:34.780]   She followed the marks and dropped to a crouch, looking down to the river.
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:38.540]   Further down she spied a dark smear on a boulder, blood.
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:43.700]   "They jumped into the river," she called out.
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:53.300]   Brinner was first to join her.
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:58.300]   Corbin led the way, running along the ridge that shadowed the river, twisting around thick
[00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:03.220]   rooted trees in dense vegetation, her eyes flitting between the path she was navigating
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:06.340]   and the banks of the river.
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:11.620]   Rounding a sharp bend in the path, she suddenly saw a shape lying on a grassy verge, firm
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:14.500]   matted, and blood stained.
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.660]   Her heart stopped.
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:20.340]   Storm She skilied to a halt on the ridge above the
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:25.620]   wolfen, her part of her mind noticing large boot prints in the grass.
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:30.580]   In a spray of dirt she scrambled over the edge, clinging to root and vine as she made
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.940]   her way down to the riverbank.
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:39.300]   Storm lay still as stone, and she was covered in blood a huge wound was visible above her
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.300]   shoulder.
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:45.980]   Corbin crouched, too scared to touch her, not wanting to confirm what her eyes were telling
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.940]   her.
[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:52.820]   Stifling tears, she remembered the first time she had seen Storm when she had threatened
[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:56.140]   to turn the wolfen into a cloak.
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:01.700]   Even then she had seen the bond between Corbin and his faithful and vigilant shadow.
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:06.460]   Since then, she had developed her own bond with the wolfen, more like a sword brother
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.300]   to her than a mere animal.
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:14.980]   As Gar joined her, she tentatively reached out her hand and laded upon Storm's body.
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:16.540]   She felt nothing.
[00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:20.700]   No, please, Elion above.
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:27.380]   She screwed her eyes shut tight, pressed harder, flattening her palm against Storm's deep chest,
[00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:33.260]   willing her hands to feel the movement of life a drawn breath the pumping of Storm's heart.
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:38.380]   With every moment, her hopes faded, a bleakness taking hold inside, spreading through her
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:40.460]   like ink through water.
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:48.780]   And then, she felt it, a flicker, a heartbeat deep within the cavern of Storm's broad chest.
[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:52.620]   Corbin opened her eyes and saw Storm's amber gaze regarding her.
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:58.860]   The wolfen whined, a weak, miserable sound, but one that gave Corbin a rush of joy.
[00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:05.700]   Storm's tail thumped feebly on the turf.
[00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:10.580]   After four, Corbin.
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:15.020]   Corbin walked through a world of gray, dimly aware that he was staggering close to a wide
[00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:16.020]   and dark river.
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:23.420]   There was a splash and a wide ripple, the hint of something large and sinuous in its depths.
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:28.700]   Bloated dark clouds boiled above him, flickering with lightning, and black shapes winged through
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:32.540]   them with an occasional gleam of chainmail and iron.
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:35.460]   This is the other world.
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:41.620]   His knee throbbed and a pain spasm through his chest with every in drawn breath.
[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:46.340]   He fixed his eyes on the ground before him, concentrated on each step.
[00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:50.260]   There had always been an element of the other world that calmed him, a serenity that settled
[00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:54.260]   within him that gave him a sense of strength and hope.
[00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:56.500]   But this time was different.
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:59.020]   There was something afraid about the peacefulness.
[00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:01.580]   It felt false.
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:07.500]   Everything lurked at the fringes of his mind, trying, needing to be remembered.
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:12.660]   When next he looked up, the river was flowing into a valley, cliffs rearing up by the side
[00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:15.620]   of him tall and forbidding.
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:19.780]   The head of him, the river spilt into a lake.
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:23.500]   Vibrant colour was seeping into the landscape with every step into the valley, the grass
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:28.860]   grew greener, the river bluer, as if colour was seeping up from the rock below.
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:33.820]   I know this place, have been here before.
[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:40.140]   The green valley and the lake of deep blue, gentle waves lapped against the shore.
[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:45.540]   A sound drew Corbin's eye towards the lake's heart, a splash and ripples, as if a stone
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:48.380]   had been thrown into water.
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:52.460]   His memory prodded at him and his eyes wandered back to the lake shore, searching for something
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:55.140]   else, and then he saw it.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:59.700]   The red-leafed maple that he had once sat beneath.
[00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:04.540]   Without thinking he made his way to it and sat down, his back to the trunk.
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:10.260]   Everything was still, no breeze to stir the grass or leaves, no harm of insects.
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:12.940]   The silence was oppressive.
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:19.380]   And then, high above, like a heartbeat, there was a beat of wings.
[00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:23.700]   He glanced up through the lattice of leaf and bark and saw a figure silhouetted against
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:29.620]   the clouds, human-like, a spear clutched in one hand, broad white feathered wings, powering
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:32.020]   through the air.
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:42.260]   The Benelim - Michael - Michael - Then, like an avalanche, he remembered.
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:47.340]   Michael, in the great hall of Drassil, telling Corbin about the deception of the Benelim,
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:52.420]   how the prophecy was nothing more than a strategy, a trick to force Asroth's hand to lure Calidus
[00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:58.660]   and the Catashim to Drassil, that the bright star and black sun were in invention, fabricated
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:02.380]   to snare Asroth in the trap of his own making.
[00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:07.580]   A sound strategy, maybe, in the great war between Benelim and Catashim, the faithful
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:14.380]   and the fallen, apart from the fact that it used people's lives like pawns on a throwboard.
[00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:19.980]   My dar's life, my mams, so many others.
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:25.820]   Rage swept through him, veined with betrayal at the memory of Michael's confession.
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:29.780]   He remembered resisting the urge to strike Michael, then leaving, knowing his rage was
[00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:35.860]   at the boundaries of his control, and had ended up sitting upon a hill in the forest.
[00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:40.500]   He had sat there a long time, contemplating Michael's words, trying to make some sense
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:43.580]   of what it would mean for the future.
[00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:52.620]   And then the jot on giants had come.
[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:58.980]   Images flickered through his mind, a bear roaring, spittle spraying from its red moor,
[00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:03.580]   running, foliage whipping his face, the thunder of the bear's pursuit, the wounds to his
[00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:10.500]   knee and chest, a spear piercing storm, a river, ice cold water.
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:14.740]   Some howling as giants had dragged him away from her side.
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:16.580]   Storm.
[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:20.620]   Pain shuttered through Corbin's chest as if someone were gripping his heart, squeezing
[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:22.060]   and twisting it.
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:24.900]   He couldn't breathe.
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:27.820]   His sorrow was a physical thing that crushed the air from his lungs.
[00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:32.900]   He staggered towards the lake, dropping to his knees at the water's edge.
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:38.260]   Even as he did so, more memories flooded his mind, an unstoppable wave of drassil, the
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:43.240]   frantic blowing of horns and sound of battle that had drifted up to him.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:50.480]   Images of his loved ones swam before his eyes, Corbin, Gar, Cohen, Dath and Farrell, Brinner,
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.980]   so many others.
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.780]   Do they still live?
[00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:57.980]   Who was attacking drassil?
[00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:01.940]   Dimly, he became aware of movement.
[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:07.060]   Before him, the water of the lake started to shift and foam, something rising from the
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:08.060]   depths.
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:15.100]   A shape appeared, water cascading and masking for a moment, the creature within.
[00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:20.220]   Then a man was striding from the lake, with water dripping from the dark cloak that trailed
[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:22.500]   him like seaweed.
[00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:24.180]   He approached Corbin.
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:26.860]   An interested, amicable smile upon his face.
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:29.380]   His skin was gray-mottled and vain like a dead thing.
[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:32.340]   His hair was black and slick as oil.
[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:36.060]   A black scabbarded sword hung at his hip.
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:43.140]   "Well," the man said, "it's not often that I get visitors."
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:47.660]   His voice was liquid, flowing like a shallow stream of a shingle.
[00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:51.420]   "What brings you to my home?"
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:55.780]   "I, I've been here before," Corbin said.
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:57.780]   "I know.
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:59.220]   I've watched you."
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:03.420]   "This is the other world," Corbin said.
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:11.020]   "It is, and this lake, this tree, this valley," the dark headman said with the wave of his
[00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:14.340]   hands, "are mine."
[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:15.820]   He shrugged.
[00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:17.700]   Water dripped from his hair.
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:19.180]   "Are you?"
[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:22.420]   "Ben Ellum," Corbin asked.
[00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:25.260]   The man laughed, a damp exhalation.
[00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:30.860]   "Those pompous fools know, though to my shame we are related."
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:34.220]   "Kadashim," Corbin asked fearful.
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:39.660]   "Hardly," the man snorted, "those fawning debauched deviance.
[00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:41.860]   Do I look like one of them?"
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:50.020]   "No," Corbin admitted, "well then, I am just me, Viathan."
[00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:55.260]   He lifted his hands, held one up to the sky, split his fingers.
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:58.220]   Corbin saw that they were wept like a frog's feet.
[00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:03.220]   "You are from the world of flesh, are you not?"
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:04.380]   The man said.
[00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:12.220]   Corbin nodded werily, "and what is your name, creature of flesh?"
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:17.020]   Viathan asked him, leaning in uncomfortably close.
[00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:21.020]   His breath washing over Corbin moist and full of rot.
[00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:28.500]   Corbin did not want to tell him, "I'm going to go now," he said, standing, wanting to
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:30.260]   be far away from his creature.
[00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:34.020]   "I don't think so," Viathan sighed.
[00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:40.220]   "I think we should continue this conversation somewhere a little more…private."
[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:45.180]   Corbin backed away, turning to leave.
[00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:47.260]   Something grabbed his ankle.
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:52.900]   Going down he saw that it was a tendril of Viathan's cloak, flexing like a grasping limb.
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:57.140]   It wrapped itself around his leg as Viathan walked back towards the lake, then, with shocking
[00:56:57.140 --> 00:57:02.540]   strength the cloak pulled tight and started dragging Corbin.
[00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:07.260]   For a moment, Corbin was too shocked to resist, but then he scrambled back, yanking at his
[00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:09.780]   ankle, hand grasping for his sword.
[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:15.820]   "Come on, don't dally," Viathan called over his shoulder as he reached the lake.
[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:19.740]   He walked in, sinking rapidly.
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:25.420]   The cloak seemed to split to flow, forming a myriad of strands, reaching up to Corbin,
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:30.020]   each one contracting around his ankles, wrists and throats.
[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:34.780]   Then he was being pulled down to the lake shore, just like a fly in a spider's web
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:36.540]   into the water.
[00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:41.180]   Panic filled him as his head sank beneath the surface, and he struggled desperately,
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:45.220]   straining, veins bulging, muscles screaming.
[00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:49.780]   With a sinew tearing effort, he pulled one arm free and then he was bursting out of the
[00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:54.780]   water, hoisted into the air, dangling before the creature, held up by his dark cloak that
[00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:59.140]   looked now more like a squirming nest of snakes.
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:04.140]   Corbin gasped for breath, gripping at the cloak strands, enclosing him to little effect.
[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:06.900]   Viathan regarded him with a cold fascination.
[00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:13.740]   "Tell me your name!" Viathan said, anger swelling in his voice, the crash of waves upon
[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:14.740]   rocks.
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:18.780]   "Let me go!" Corbin grunted through his constricted chest.
[00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:25.340]   "You have trespassed here," disturbed my rest, Viathan said wetly as he pulled Corbin
[00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:26.340]   closer.
[00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:37.260]   "In return, I will have some answers, and then, after, I may see how you taste."
[00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:40.860]   A wave of found breath engulfed Corbin, making his stomach lurch.
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:42.780]   "What are you?"
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:43.780]   Corbin coughed.
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:49.100]   "I am Viathan," the creature said.
[00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:53.740]   His mouth opening wide, seeming to grow before Corbin's eyes wider and wider, revealing
[00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:57.660]   rows of razor-sharp teeth glistening and dripping with mucus.
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:03.660]   "Eater of souls!"
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:09.740]   There was a whistling sound, and a spear slammed into Viathan's cloak, piercing it.
[00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:13.580]   Corbin screamed as Ben-Elium swept down from the sky.
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:17.180]   More spears flew, stabbing into Viathan's body.
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:22.300]   His yell deepened into a bellow of pain and rage, and Corbin found himself thrown to the
[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:26.940]   ground as the creature turned its attention to its attackers.
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:31.420]   Then hands were grasping Corbin, and he was hoisted into the air again.
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:37.980]   There was a Ben-Elium either side of him surging skywards, their wings beating hard.
[00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:41.460]   When heartbeats, the conflict in the lake was below them.
[00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:47.020]   Viathan and his living cloak sinking into the water, one strand quilling around a Ben-Elium,
[00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:49.980]   dragging it beneath the surface.
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:55.380]   The Ben-Elium's scream cut short as the water closed over its head.
[00:59:55.380 --> 01:00:00.340]   They flew higher, following the course of a winding valley, twisting and turning amongst
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:05.540]   peaks and sheer cliffs until Corbin saw a fortress appear in the crags, a series of
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:08.780]   towers and battlements.
[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:13.020]   Carved from bone-white stone, it seemed to glow, even under the dark clouds that pressed
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:15.540]   down from above.
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:20.300]   The silhouettes of Ben-Elium filled the air about its towers, some spiraling amidst the
[01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:26.380]   clouds, others hovering sentinels with long spears and glistening mail.
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:31.260]   He saw that many more patrolled the long winding walls, and the sounds of combat drifted up
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:35.420]   to him from the huge courtyards between the high towers.
[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:38.660]   They are sparring, as we were in Jassil.
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:41.620]   They are preparing for war.
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:45.820]   His rescue was alighted upon the flat roof of a tower and half-dranked Corbin through
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:52.380]   an archway, down a flight of stairs, marching him into a huge high-ceilinged chamber.
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:57.980]   Within it, thousands of Ben-Elium stood, all gleaming mail and white feathers, a dense
[01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:03.900]   crown which parted before Corbin and his guards, in an elegant ripple of feather and mail.
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:07.700]   The pale, emotionless faces staring at him.
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:14.860]   In front of him was a raised deus, wide steps leading up to it, and upon it a great white
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:20.820]   throne, paler's bone, a splayed back fashion to look like feathered wings that rose and
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:24.940]   culled about the figure slumped within it.
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:29.180]   Its white feathered wings were wrapped around the figure like a great cloak, feather tips
[01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:31.740]   draping the floor.
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:37.420]   The figure's head was bowed, dark hair hanging, concealing its face.
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:42.960]   As Corbin was march closer, the figure raised its head, its hair parting to reveal a familiar
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:45.940]   face that stared back at him.
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:48.940]   Michael.
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:52.780]   Emotions ignited within Corbin, warring with one another.
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:57.180]   Relief at seeing the face of a comrade, a friend in this strange place, but alongside
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:01.460]   that the still raw wound of Michael's betrayal.
[01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:06.180]   Corbin felt his cheeks flush with anger, even as Michael sat straighter, his face racked
[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:10.540]   with grief and pain, an expression that was so out of place on the face of creatures normally
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:13.620]   marble carved and expressionless.
[01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:15.700]   What is wrong with him?
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:18.340]   Michael drew in a shuddering breath.
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:26.700]   "Thank, Elion," Michael said, "you still live in your world of flesh.
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:32.300]   If your spirit is here then your body has survived."
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:36.420]   Michael seemed to struggle with his speech, as if each word took an effort of pain and
[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:37.420]   will.
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:44.580]   Otherwise, your spirit would have crossed the bridge of swords.
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:46.780]   Corbin blinked.
[01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:51.700]   Michael reached out, beckoning Corbin to come closer.
[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:55.980]   Corbin flinched away, "Don't touch me," Corbin snapped, remembering the great hall
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:56.980]   in Drassil.
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:59.620]   The great lie.
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:03.580]   Corbin heard a hiss of outrage ripple through the room behind him.
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:11.460]   Michael held a hand up, "Peace," Michael said, "but one of the Ben Ellyn spluttered.
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:16.860]   This creature of flesh he gives insult to you are high-capped in second only to the
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:18.860]   all-father.
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:25.220]   He has a good cause," Michael said, lowering his head.
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:28.780]   He leaned back in his chair and gestured for Corbin to stand.
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:32.140]   Corbin saw that Michael was paler than he'd ever seen him.
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:34.820]   Around his neck was a red wound, raw and angry.
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:38.060]   It was leaking some clear, ico-like substance.
[01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:40.420]   "What happened to you?"
[01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:47.780]   Corbin said, "Sometimes, if the wound is bad in the world of flesh, we bring a shadow of
[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:51.700]   it with us back to the other world."
[01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:56.260]   His hand went to his chest, the dull ache he felt with every breath, and understood that
[01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:59.220]   it was an echo of his broken ribs.
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:07.700]   "So, what is that a shadow of," Corbin said, pointing to Michael's wound, "I was beheaded
[01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:12.660]   in Drassil," Michael said, "What?"
[01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:19.300]   The humblasts, the sounds of battle that I heard, a seed of dread unfurled deep in Corbin's
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:20.300]   gut.
[01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:24.820]   Calidus, nathair, they attacked.
[01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:25.820]   "How?"
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.540]   "The tunnels," Michael said wearily.
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:31.860]   "What are my friends and kin, my people?"
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:35.460]   Some escaped, Michael breathed.
[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:38.940]   Gar let a retreat down the north tunnel.
[01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:43.940]   I held the cadre shim as long as I could.
[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:49.260]   He shook his head, "Drassil is taken."
[01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:54.860]   The fortress, fallen, taken by nathair and Calidus.
[01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:58.020]   The implications hit Corbin like a stone fist.
[01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:04.780]   My warband defeated, those that followed me, trusted me, dead, my friends.
[01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:11.860]   "See what your scheming has achieved?" he snarled and launched himself at Michael.
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:15.980]   His attack was so unexpected and so fast that he had his fingers clamped about Michael's
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:18.900]   throat before anyone could move.
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:24.260]   Then there was an explosion of activity behind him, shouting, hands grasping him, wings flexing,
[01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:25.260]   beating.
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:30.140]   Blows reigned upon Corbin, but he shrugged them off, continued squeezing.
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:33.700]   Michael did not fight back, just sat within the great wings of his throne and stared into
[01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:36.740]   Corbin's eyes as he cried tears of grief and rage.
[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:40.100]   "You have murdered my friends!" he yelled.
[01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:44.540]   A red rage swallowing him, replacing his despair.
[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:50.300]   Corbin crunched into his head and the world disappeared for a moment in a white explosion.
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:53.940]   He felt his fingers slipping from Michael, tried to hold on, but then more hands were
[01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:58.700]   gripping him, dragging him back, pressing him onto his knees.
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:03.620]   He looked up to see weapons raised over him and angry faces encircling him.
[01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:06.460]   A spear was speeding towards his heart.
[01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:12.860]   "No," Michael said, and the spear froze, a hand span from Corbin's chest.
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:17.420]   Every voice is called out, Corbin heard words like "punishment" and "sack-relage."
[01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:23.060]   "No," Michael repeated, and the crowd parted before Corbin to reveal Michael still sitting
[01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:25.380]   on the throne.
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:30.300]   He regarded Corbin with his emotionless face back in place, though Corbin thought he saw
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.020]   cracks within it.
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:35.700]   "He has caused to be angry with me."
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:40.180]   "Angry," Corbin shook his head, "you lied to me.
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:44.460]   And all of us in Drassel used us as bait, as pawns.
[01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:50.140]   All of you," he added, glaring at the Ben Ellym gathered around him.
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:54.860]   Most of them were glaring back at him, and now it seems that your plan has worked a little
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:56.420]   too well.
[01:06:56.420 --> 01:07:01.100]   He certainly brought Caledus running to Drassel, "tell me, Michael, was it also part of your
[01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:08.260]   plan for Drassel to fall, for my friends, my kin, my people, to be slaughtered?"
[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:13.140]   He ground his teeth swallowed, "What for you to be beheaded?"
[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:19.980]   "No," it was not, Michael said with a slow sigh.
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:23.140]   The war is lost before it even began.
[01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:28.740]   The banish lands conquered, all those whom I love slain or scattered.
[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:33.460]   Just spare rose up in him, then, draining all energy from his limbs.
[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:37.140]   He slumped in his captor's grip.
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:41.540]   "This is not over," Michael said.
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:45.380]   It took a few moments for his words to seep through the fog of misery and hopelessness
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:47.100]   that engulfed Corbin.
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:56.180]   "Of course it is," Corbin whispered, "no, not while you live, not while Caledus still
[01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:59.540]   seeks the seven treasures.
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:07.100]   He needs them all to fulfill his plan, and until then, Asroth is bound here in the other
[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:08.100]   world."
[01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:14.940]   "There is no way back from this, we don't know that," Michael said.
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:21.500]   Gar led many from Drassel, they may still live, there are those who would still stand
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:23.780]   against Nothair and Caledus.
[01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:31.860]   "There is still hope," Corbin's head snapped up, locking eyes with Michael.
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:35.900]   "Do not speak to me of hope.
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:40.260]   You who have fed me lies all my life.
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:44.900]   You are no better than Asroth and his cat-a-shem a liar, a deceiver, and I wish I'd never
[01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:47.380]   met you."
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:50.620]   Angry words rippled around the chamber.
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:52.780]   Michael's gaze hardened.
[01:08:52.780 --> 01:09:01.060]   "I have allowed you the courtesy of expressing your anger, but do not go too far."
[01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:09.900]   "There is more at stake here than your hurt feelings you are behaving like an angry child."
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:15.580]   He paused, visibly sagged in his chair, passed a hand over his eyes.
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:20.420]   "Your whole world lies in the balance.
[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:27.340]   It is not over yet there is still hope, a fighter's chance.
[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:31.380]   There is no chance, nothing that I can do.
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:36.740]   Back in the banished lands I am a captive of the Jotan, wound in my bones, broken, and
[01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:40.300]   storm is dead."
[01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:46.900]   His voice choked in his throat, a fresh wave of emotion swelling in his chest.
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:49.380]   Michael lowered his head.
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:53.580]   "Another grievous blow," he muttered.
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:58.220]   Some was a better guardian than a score of SHIELDman.
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:02.500]   "She was more than my guardian," Corbin snarled.
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:05.220]   "She was my companion.
[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:11.380]   My friend," he rubbed his eyes, angrily brushed away his tears.
[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:14.020]   "Your lies?
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:20.180]   Of course the death of my kin, my dad, my man, my friends, and so many others.
[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:23.140]   All of them dying for a hope that never existed.
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:26.640]   All of them dying for me.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:32.020]   And because you underestimated Caledus, you have left us with no chance, while there is
[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:39.340]   breath in your body there is a chance," Michael shouted, leaning forwards in his chair, hands
[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:42.540]   gripping the armrests.
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:51.180]   For a moment his cold face melted away, and if there is no chance of victory then what
[01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:53.460]   of vengeance?
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:11:00.120]   Do more than talk and whine, seek your vengeance for those fallen.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:06.540]   Or would you rather wallow in self-pity than try to save your loved ones?"
[01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:10.500]   He sagged, the effort clearly draining him.
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.940]   "I will not be told what to do by him.
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:16.420]   I will be controlled and manipulated by him no longer."
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:20.740]   Nevertheless, Michael's words affected him.
[01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:26.580]   Memories of Gar and Cohen, Coraline, Farron and Daff, Brinner, Hidana.
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:30.340]   So many others that he had met during a long, hard journey from his home in Dankaric to
[01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:32.540]   Drassel.
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:37.940]   And the thought of them without him, perhaps fighting, maybe dying.
[01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:43.820]   For a moment all he wanted was to get back to them, to be at their side.
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:48.300]   I will not abandon them to death or torment, let them face the end alone.
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:52.940]   I must go back if there is a chance to help them.
[01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:57.060]   He looked up at Michael, felt his fists clenching.
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:03.620]   "I will go back, but not for you, not for any of you.
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:08.740]   I am your puppet no longer, I go to help those that I love."
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:13.500]   Michael stared at him for long, silent moments, then nodded his head.
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:21.220]   "I will help you all that I can, though I am bound to the other world now.
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:25.100]   I cannot return to the banished lands.
[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:29.460]   I don't want your help," Corbin growled.
[01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:31.380]   Michael finally nodded.
[01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:35.460]   "Good?" he whispered.
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:38.900]   He approached Corbin and placed a palm over his eyes, whispering words that Corbin could
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.180]   not hear.
[01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:49.580]   He opened his mouth to say something, but then the world seemed to fade about him.
[01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:57.020]   Chapter Five Rafe Rafe felt something wet and rough
[01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:59.740]   scratching across his cheek.
[01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:03.460]   He wanted to move, but found he lacked the ability.
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:09.700]   Even opening his eyes was too much of an effort, so he just lay there, allowing his other senses
[01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:12.100]   to wash over him.
[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:13.340]   He ached.
[01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:16.980]   His muscles, joints, his very bones seemed to throb.
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:22.100]   But even as he became aware of the sensation, it began to fade, transforming into something
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:29.140]   else, a sense of relaxed exhaustion, like lying in a hot bath after a long hunt.
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:33.820]   He could hear birdsong, the ripple of river water and the holes of moored boats nudging
[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:36.140]   into one another.
[01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:41.860]   On that, the drum of hooves, many feet, voices.
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:45.780]   He did not know how long he lay on the ground like that, but at some point the rough wet
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:48.580]   scratching on his face came back.
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:51.380]   A dog's tongue licking him.
[01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:54.460]   A smile cracked his lips and he opened his eyes.
[01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:59.460]   An explosion of light burst upon him, feeling as if rays of the sun had pierced his skull,
[01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:01.820]   lancing through his head.
[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:03.700]   He screwed his eyes shut.
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:05.500]   The pain dimmed.
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:08.220]   He tried again, slowly this time.
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:12.700]   He saw a black nose, snuffling, fur tickling his chin.
[01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:16.540]   "Hello, sniffer," he crowed.
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:21.340]   His voice roar and cracked, ignoring the pain he pulled himself to his knees, then to his
[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:22.780]   feet.
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:26.420]   He staggered and braced himself against the wide trunk of a tree.
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:29.600]   "What has happened to me?"
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:33.740]   He stretched, the stiffness in his body melting away.
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:40.340]   For a while he stood there, feeling his muscles uncoiling, enjoying the sense of energy, of
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:43.360]   strength and vitality that flowed through him.
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:50.140]   "I feel good," he muttered, smiling and reaching to Pat Sniffer's head.
[01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:54.140]   He saw Scratcher standing further away, eyeing him suspiciously.
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:58.740]   "It's all right," he said, beckoning the hound.
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:00.300]   "Nothing to fear?"
[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:07.060]   The hound came to him, ears still flattened, tail-tucked low, and he laughed, ruffling
[01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:08.660]   the hound's fur.
[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:11.860]   "I'm starving."
[01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:13.540]   Memories filtered back.
[01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:18.460]   Of the battle in the swamp against Adanna's warband, his desperate escape, of walking away
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:24.540]   from Morcan's tower after his interrogation by Ryn and her giant Uthas, then walking along
[01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:29.300]   the riverbank, finding a solitary spot beside a tree to drink a skin of wine and eat some
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.540]   cold lamb.
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:36.500]   He'd scratched at his chin, felt a thick layer of stubble, which felt strange.
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:40.340]   "How long have I been here?"
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:45.340]   He looked around, at the marshland trees and bushes, the birds nesting amongst them, blue
[01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:51.060]   and orange butterflies flitting, then up at the sky, which was a clear blue, the spring
[01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:53.780]   sun warm upon his face.
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:16:01.820]   Somehow, everything felt sharper, brighter and clearer, a filthy bone.
[01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:05.940]   He looked down and noticed the shoulder of lamb he had brought with him from the camp.
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:10.260]   The hounds had stripped it clean and cracked the bones.
[01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:14.860]   Beside it were the broken shards of the box he'd found in the bog near Dunterris.
[01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:21.700]   And next to that was a cup, dark metal, runes carved into its rim, a dribble of wine ran
[01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:23.780]   from it.
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:30.620]   And he remembered, like a punch in the gut, a drank from it.
[01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:33.980]   His legs felt weak and he leaned against the tree as he felt for a moment, an echo of the
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:38.420]   pleasure and pain that eract his body after drinking from the cup.
[01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:39.420]   He felt scared.
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:41.520]   "What have I done?"
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:48.620]   "It is an enchanted cup it has some kind of spell upon it, but I'm not dead.
[01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:52.300]   If anything I feel more alive than ever before."
[01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:56.260]   He took a tentative step away from the tree, reaching down to pick up the bag that contained
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:57.980]   his kit.
[01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:01.980]   For a few heartbeats he stood and stared at the cup, then quickly bent and grabbed it,
[01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:04.820]   stuffing it into his bag.
[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:08.940]   He picked his way along a twisting trail amongst the tall, grassed banks of reed, eventually
[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:12.860]   coming across a stream that led him back to the river.
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:14.980]   The river was full of moored boats.
[01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:21.420]   The strong smells of newly cut pine, sap and fresh-soaked pitch filled the air.
[01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:26.380]   Frames of scaffolding timbers that held half-constructed boats lined the riverbank, skeletal
[01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:30.820]   hulls like the bones of flesh-picked whales.
[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:33.460]   Teams of men were working on them.
[01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:38.780]   Rafe walked past unnoticed, moving out onto the rolling meadows that spread beyond the marshlands
[01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:43.220]   and ended in the north at the fringes of the Baglin Forest.
[01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:48.860]   He stopped here, staring, surprised at the difference in what felt like only a half-day,
[01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:52.140]   but had clearly been longer.
[01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:56.140]   Immediately before him was Morcan's tower.
[01:17:56.140 --> 01:18:02.700]   Wains pulled by shaggy-coated orok, filed in and out of the tower gates.
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:09.380]   On the meadow about it, the tents of Rin's warband of black and gold had multiplied.
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:15.380]   To the west, Rafe saw horsemen riding at straw targets, other men on foot sparring with practice
[01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:18.260]   swords and spears.
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:22.180]   They are ready for another stab at a dana then.
[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:29.260]   Rafe Morcan was striding towards him, looking striking in his black cuirass, and sabled
[01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:37.300]   cloak, edged in gold trim, hair pulled back, warrior braid freshly bound with gold wire.
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:40.500]   Two guards walked at his back.
[01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:45.700]   He looks far better than the last time I saw him, in Rin's tent, fresh from the battle,
[01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:49.500]   covered in marsh slime and blood and stinking like a stagnant pool.
[01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:53.060]   "Where have you been, boy?"
[01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:54.580]   Morcan snapped at him.
[01:18:54.580 --> 01:19:02.820]   "I, uh, over there, sleep in," Rafe said, pointing vaguely at the river and marshes.
[01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:07.260]   "Sleeping," Morcan snorted, "for a ten night?"
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:08.260]   "A ten night."
[01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:13.820]   "I thought you deserted, then fit you at the stomach for any more battle."
[01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:20.340]   "I have so," Rafe said, pridling at Morcan's veiled insult.
[01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:26.740]   "Watch yourself," Morcan scald, "I'm Lord of Arr than now, I could put your head on
[01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:30.580]   a spike with a snap of my fingers."
[01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:35.860]   Rafe felt a blossoming of anger, hotter and faster than he was used to.
[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:38.140]   With an effort, he suppressed it.
[01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:41.700]   "I thought Evanis was Lord of Arr'den."
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:49.860]   "Evanis has not returned, is believed dead," Morcan said, disdainfully.
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:54.300]   Rin has appointed me to rule in his absence.
[01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:55.300]   "Dead?"
[01:19:55.300 --> 01:20:01.940]   In truth, Rafe had lost sight of Evanis when the rebels' fire had started sinking their
[01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:05.860]   boats and Rafe had become too preoccupied with his own survival to worry about anyone
[01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:08.100]   else.
[01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:11.180]   But he would grieve for Evanis if he was dead.
[01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:14.380]   He had been his lord for as long as he could remember.
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:18.180]   His dar had served Evanis as huntsman for many years.
[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:24.900]   "So," Morcan told him arrogantly, "I am your lord now, and you shall remember it.
[01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:30.220]   Now come with me, Queen Rin wishes to speak with you."
[01:20:30.220 --> 01:20:34.740]   He followed Morcan around the rim of the hill, skirting the palisaded wall as they made their
[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:39.020]   way through lines of tents to a central larger one.
[01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:45.820]   Towering like statues, two giants stood outside alongside a handful of Rin's shieldmen.
[01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:49.180]   Rafe gazed at them as he waited to be announced.
[01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:52.020]   The giant nearest to him was a female.
[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:57.500]   He stood with folded arms, returning his stare, too knife-hilt as long as short swords criss-crossing
[01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.340]   her back.
[01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:02.020]   Her brow furrowed as she regarded him.
[01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:07.940]   "Queen Rin, we'll see you now," a shieldman told them, and Rafe stepped out of the sunshine
[01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:10.940]   into the cool shadow of the tent.
[01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:15.780]   Rin was sat at a broad table, her silver hair braided with golden wire.
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:19.980]   A bare skin cloak pulled high about her neck.
[01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:23.900]   A huge parchment was unrolled on the table.
[01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:28.660]   Rafe glanced at it, and saw it was a map of the marshlands, their position at Morcan's
[01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:31.360]   tower marked upon it.
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:38.300]   The marshes were largely a blank, with a circle roughly marking the position of Dunkrin.
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:44.020]   Behind Rin stood Uthas of the Benofi, gripping a thick, shafted spear, and about his neck
[01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:47.300]   hung a necklace made from long, curved fangs.
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:52.420]   "Ah, the wanderer returns," Rin cried when she saw him.
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:57.780]   "I thought you dared, or captured," she added, her eyes narrowing.
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:59.780]   "Can I trust you now?
[01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:01.980]   Where have you been?"
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:05.860]   "Sleeping," Morcan said before Rafe could reply.
[01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:07.860]   "Who is?"
[01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:08.860]   Rin asked.
[01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:15.700]   "No one, myself," Rafe started, "my dogs."
[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:17.300]   Rin raised an eyebrow.
[01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:19.940]   "No need to be shy.
[01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:24.220]   Everyone needs some time to relax and indulge in their personal pleasures.
[01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:26.940]   Else what is life for?"
[01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:31.180]   But sleeping for a ten-night, a little extreme, don't you think?
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:34.740]   And a little unbelievable, "Are you lying to me?"
[01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:43.620]   "No, my queen," Rafe mumbled, "I drank something," Morcan snorted laughter.
[01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:46.980]   Rin paused and stared at Rafe, head cocking to one side.
[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:49.180]   "Are you well?
[01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:53.300]   You seem... different."
[01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:55.700]   Rafe returned her gaze steadily.
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:58.380]   His eyes drawn to the details of her face.
[01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:02.980]   The wrinkles creased around her mouth, tracing her tapestry upwards across the arch of her
[01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:06.020]   cheeks to cluster around her eyes.
[01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:09.780]   Her skin appeared so fine, almost translucent.
[01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:15.860]   His gaze was drawn deeper, the pulse of myriad veins beneath her diaphona's skin, a steady
[01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:18.780]   and hypnotic beat.
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:25.220]   His gaze drifted higher, to her eyes, which were a deep dark blue like still waters.
[01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:27.020]   They transfixed him.
[01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:32.900]   "The answer, your queen," Morcan snapped, raising his hand to cuff Rafe across the back
[01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:35.340]   of her head.
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:39.460]   Rafe saw it all as if in slow motion, and before he'd even realised what he was doing,
[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:45.460]   his hand shot up, grabbing Morcan's wrist and stopping it dead in its tracks.
[01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:48.140]   There was a moment of shock, silence.
[01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:53.100]   Everyone staring at Rafe as Morcan tugged on his arm, unable to break Rafe's grip.
[01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:59.540]   "How dare you!" Morcan snarled, as he struggled to free himself before reaching for the knife
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:00.540]   at his belt.
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:04.260]   "I'll carve off your bloody fingers one by one."
[01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:08.060]   "Enough!" Rin said.
[01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:13.420]   Morcan froze, and with a conscious effort, Rafe suppressed a bubbling anger within him
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:16.180]   and released Morcan's wrist.
[01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:19.180]   Red marks were already purpling into bruises.
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:23.540]   "I don't like being struck," Rafe muttered.
[01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:29.780]   "So we can see," Rin said with a calculating smile.
[01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:34.780]   Morcan scowled at him as Uthas leaned forwards, grey, bushy eyebrows bunching together in
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:36.740]   a frown.
[01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:41.300]   Morcan is Lord of Art, and then, "What have I done?"
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:47.900]   "I am sorry," he said quietly, then rubbed his eyes.
[01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:53.940]   "I do not know why I did that, or what's happening to me?"
[01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:57.740]   Rin exchanged a quick unfathomable look with Uthas before turning back.
[01:24:57.740 --> 01:25:01.780]   "I have need of you, so I shall forgive you.
[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:02.780]   This once."
[01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:06.300]   "Thank you, my lady."
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:10.260]   Rafe had the sense to dip his head as he spoke, avoiding the urge to glance at Morcan
[01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:11.260]   and smirk.
[01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:19.300]   "And I am sorry, my queen," he added for good measure.
[01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:20.580]   Rin waved a hand.
[01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:26.500]   "Sorry, there's not good enough," she said, a tone entering her voice that scared Rafe.
[01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:31.140]   "I am your queen, and you are my subject."
[01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:33.700]   "Learn your place."
[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:36.220]   "I will," Rafe muttered.
[01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:42.900]   "See that you do," Rin said, "and also make sure that the next time I send for you,
[01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:48.180]   you come, your life is mine."
[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:51.580]   She stared at him, no hint of expression on her face.
[01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:58.540]   "I can make it a good life, or an unpleasantly short one."
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:25:59.540]   Rafe gulped.
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:02.660]   "Do we understand one another?"
[01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:06.180]   "I, my queen," Rafe nodded.
[01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:07.180]   "Good!
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:11.500]   Now, come over here, and help me with this map.
[01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:19.380]   I aim to have Adana's head on a platter within a ten night."
[01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:21.180]   Chapter 6
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:27.260]   Kamlin Kamlin padded along the stream's edge.
[01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:30.620]   His bow held loosely in one hand.
[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:36.140]   He was returning to Dunkin' from a hunting trip, hunting men.
[01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:39.580]   There had been a ten night since the Battle of Dunkin' where Evanis and Morcan's war
[01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:42.420]   band had been largely scattered.
[01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:46.500]   He and a score of others had set about hunting down the stragglers.
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:51.580]   The more we kill now, the fewer will come back to try and kill us later.
[01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:55.700]   Kamlin had split his hunting party into pairs, although he himself had ended up in a group
[01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:57.660]   of three.
[01:26:57.660 --> 01:27:01.580]   He glanced down at Meg, the bern who he had rescued from a village on the outskirts of
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:02.580]   the marshlands.
[01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:05.660]   "Though she's more than paid me back?
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:09.820]   The time she's saved my hide, now?"
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:15.300]   She was walking alongside him, wearing a warrior's leather jerkin, holding a spear in one hand,
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:19.020]   her other resting upon the pommel of a new dagger that was hanging at her belt, all of
[01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:23.180]   them spoils taken from the Battle of Dunkin'.
[01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:27.580]   Kamlin had helped her cut down and restitched the jerkin, as well as chopping an arm's
[01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:31.860]   length of the spear to make it more manageable for her.
[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:35.420]   Most of him had been concerned about her accompanying them.
[01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:37.900]   She seemed worse, though.
[01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:42.780]   A memory of the mottled feet of a bern swinging from gallows insinuated its way into his mind,
[01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:46.540]   beneath it bloated corpses littering a courtyard.
[01:27:46.540 --> 01:27:48.700]   Much worse.
[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:52.940]   A shadow crossed his path, and he looked up to see the third member of his party flying
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:54.980]   above him.
[01:27:54.980 --> 01:28:03.220]   Crafts swooped down and squawked loudly, dark waters, tall towers.
[01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:09.660]   "I know," Kamlin muttered, "don't need a bird to tell me when I'm close to home.
[01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:12.860]   Nevertheless, he raised a hand at Craft.
[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:18.100]   When I first met that bird, I must confess I didn't like him much.
[01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:22.020]   Turns out he's right-handed to have a bow, though."
[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:27.300]   Kamlin had led him straight over a dozen enemy warriors lost in the marshes.
[01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:33.140]   Kamlin had made sure they stayed lost, left them lying face down in the mud.
[01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:37.980]   He walked through a last bank of reeds and came out on the shore of a huge lake.
[01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:43.240]   The towers and walls of Dunkin reared out of the lake's waters, damp and moss-covered
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:47.140]   like some frozen Leviathan.
[01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:51.860]   The waters moved on the battlement walls, boats scudding between towers.
[01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:54.460]   All about him on the lake shore there was motion.
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:58.600]   The wives and bends of the warriors who had fought in the battle of Dunkin had finally
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:03.420]   returned from their hiding place deeper in the marshes, and all manner of rough shelters
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:10.860]   were being erected, mostly consisting of linen tents and panelled walls of woven willow.
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:14.540]   Best not make themselves too constable.
[01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:18.620]   Big dashed off and merged into the crowds.
[01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:22.300]   Kamlin watched as a pair of children rummaged amongst the piles of war gear that had been
[01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:26.060]   stripped from the dead and heaped in mounds along the lake shore.
[01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:32.940]   Great stacks of swords and spears, shields, boots, belts, knives, quivers, shirts of
[01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:39.020]   mail, kurasses of boiled leather and cloaks of black and gold.
[01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:40.900]   Meg reappeared at his side.
[01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:45.300]   Now with an iron helmet much too big for her head added to her outfit.
[01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:48.620]   Kamlin tried not to laugh, it wasn't wholly successful.
[01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:50.140]   "What?"
[01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:51.580]   Meg scouted him.
[01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:54.860]   "Think that helmet might slow you down?"
[01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:55.860]   he said.
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:30:01.180]   "Besides, your head's thick enough, doubt if you'll need it?"
[01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:02.540]   She punched him in the leg.
[01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:04.820]   "When are we leaving?" she asked.
[01:30:04.820 --> 01:30:06.660]   "Don't know."
[01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:07.660]   He shrugged.
[01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:12.620]   "Probably talk about it a while before we get around to doing it."
[01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:16.260]   He paused as the crowds opened up before him.
[01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:21.220]   Yidana was walking calmly through their midst, stopping now and again to address someone directly,
[01:30:21.220 --> 01:30:25.980]   holding a hand here, cupping a cheek there, always seeming to be interested in what was
[01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:27.980]   being said to her.
[01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:34.460]   Baird, the one-eyed warrior of Dohan, and Von, accompanied her.
[01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:39.660]   Then frowned as he watched the young warrior, his eyes shadowed with dark circles, grief-carving
[01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:41.860]   new lines upon his face.
[01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:45.700]   "Though I'd guess I'm partly to blame for that.
[01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:50.180]   Me having killed his dar might have something to do with his current mood."
[01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:54.980]   He tracked Von after the battle, found him leagues from anywhere, alone apart from his
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:57.780]   dar, Evanis.
[01:30:57.780 --> 01:31:00.500]   Kamlin had watched as they'd argued.
[01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:04.820]   It had ended with Von turning his back on Evanis and walking away.
[01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:10.900]   Evanis had followed, hand-dipping inside his cloak and coming out with a knife in his
[01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:11.900]   fist.
[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:15.220]   Kamlin had put two arrows through the man's chest.
[01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:18.820]   His eyes flicked back to Yidana.
[01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:23.980]   She has grown since that night in Duncaric when she saw her dar murdered.
[01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:28.340]   Even fought Russian of Dohan in the court of swords and won.
[01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:32.540]   Mind, exile was too good for a woman like that.
[01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:35.460]   She'll never stop her trouble-making.
[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:40.540]   He searched behind Danna, looking for his friend, Halion.
[01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:42.780]   He should be back by now.
[01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:47.940]   Then he saw him, sitting beside a fire with Lorkan, Halion's half-brother, Russian son,
[01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:53.460]   heir to the throne of Dohan, and unofficially betrothed to Danna, with his shieldman, Brogan
[01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:56.500]   Nonek as Meg affectionately referred to him.
[01:31:56.500 --> 01:32:03.300]   "Good to see you," Halion said, rising and gripping Kamlin's forearm.
[01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:07.780]   "You too," Kamlin said with a grin.
[01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:12.940]   Kamlin looked at their faces, saw they were all sombre, attention in the air.
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:16.520]   Lorkan's dark eyes were red, looked as if he'd been weeping.
[01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:19.020]   "Am I into Robton?"
[01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:20.020]   Kamlin asked.
[01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:22.940]   "Just tell me to boog her off, if I am."
[01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:25.940]   "No, Kamlin," Lorkan said.
[01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:31.300]   Standing and surreptitiously wiping his eyes, that I was just going.
[01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:36.340]   He bathed him farewell, Halion squeezing his shoulder, and left.
[01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:38.700]   Brogan followed faithfully in his wake.
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:42.300]   "He are eight," Kamlin asked.
[01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:44.940]   "No," Halion said honestly.
[01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:46.980]   "But I think he will be."
[01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:51.220]   "I know Colonel hates him just for being Russian son, but I like him.
[01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:53.020]   There's no malice in him."
[01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:57.580]   "Well, that's a rare thing," Kamlin observed.
[01:32:57.580 --> 01:33:01.700]   And he did that I think, with Russian.
[01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:04.180]   Choosing a downer over his man wasn't easy.
[01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:06.420]   "True," Kamlin said.
[01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:09.500]   "Sometimes that I think could be a grim thing, too."
[01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:15.620]   "I, and it's weighing heavy on him, and you, by the look of it."
[01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:19.980]   Halion looked tired, a strained look about his eyes.
[01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:23.020]   "I've done, then," Kamlin asked Halion.
[01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:27.860]   "Hi," Halion breathed, "got back yesterday.
[01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:29.740]   Did it go?"
[01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:34.020]   He was going to say well, but that didn't seem like the right word.
[01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:36.260]   Halion looked away, staring out into the marshland.
[01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:39.540]   "Rosheen didn't try to escape, if that's what you mean."
[01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:42.620]   "That's something," Kamlin said.
[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:44.540]   "Hi," Halion shrugged.
[01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:49.900]   "Not the easiest thing I've done," he added, as Kamlin continued to stare at him.
[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:51.900]   "Thought you hated Russian."
[01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:53.540]   "Hadoop!"
[01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:58.380]   She murdered my man, wanted to kill me and Connell, was the reason we fled down.
[01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:00.260]   And she would have murdered a downer, too.
[01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:03.220]   "Exile, it's better than she deserves."
[01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:05.060]   "But?"
[01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:06.540]   Halion shrugged.
[01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:10.820]   His sea gray eyes hinting at the emotion he kept buried within.
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:12.860]   "Walking away was hard."
[01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:15.860]   "Exsecution is hard," you mean.
[01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:18.420]   "We called it exile, but leaving her in the middle of the marsh.
[01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:21.940]   It was a death sentence."
[01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:24.540]   Kamlin patted Halion's shoulder.
[01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:26.760]   "Good hunting?"
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:27.760]   Halion asked him.
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:28.760]   "Aye."
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:32.980]   "There are a few less warriors in black and gold to tell the way to this place.
[01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:35.100]   Am I the first back?"
[01:34:35.100 --> 01:34:38.540]   "No, you're the last," Halion said.
[01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:41.060]   "But we'll be waiting on you.
[01:34:41.060 --> 01:34:45.740]   It downer refused to hold the council until you were back safe and sound."
[01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:49.460]   Halion felt himself blush at that, a smile twitching his lips.
[01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:53.340]   It felt strange to be valued.
[01:34:53.340 --> 01:34:56.460]   Kamlin looked around the circle of familiar faces.
[01:34:56.460 --> 01:35:00.240]   They were gathered in a clearing amidst the ruins of what looked to have once been done
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:01.820]   Corinne's gatehouse.
[01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:08.180]   A collapsed tower rose above them, birds nests poking from its crumbled ramparts.
[01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:13.780]   The old wall lay in ruins, granite boulders scattered in the grass.
[01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:18.620]   With their feet, ancient flagstones lay twisted and shattered by the encroaching roots of
[01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:21.180]   willow and alder.
[01:35:21.180 --> 01:35:26.260]   A crumbling archway framed Adanna who sat upon a moss-covered boulder.
[01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:30.180]   She looked at home in a coat of mail and boiled leather-circuit, a great cloak about
[01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:33.780]   her shoulders and a sword at her hip.
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:37.060]   Surrounding her were those she trusted most closely.
[01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:43.020]   In Dathrin, her barrel-chested uncle, and Drost, the red-haired warrior from Narvon,
[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:46.420]   once shieldman to Owen, Narvon's fallen king.
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:52.860]   Lorcan, the young king in exile of Darwin, gaze solemnly at Adanna.
[01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:57.340]   The others that filled the area were mostly warriors, shieldman to those present.
[01:35:57.340 --> 01:36:02.140]   Halion, Von, and one-eyed bird watching Adanna.
[01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:07.540]   Close to them, Brogan loomed, protectively close to Lorcan.
[01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:11.620]   Craft perched upon the broken archway above Adanna like a carved statue, and I've no
[01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:15.980]   doubt that Meg is eavesdropping somewhere close by.
[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:19.900]   Adanna stood, and the quiet conversations that had whispered amongst the ruined walls
[01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:20.900]   hushed.
[01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:26.420]   "We are leaving Dathrin," she said, without any preamble.
[01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:32.020]   Of her, craft ruffled his feathers, "leaving?" he caught quietly.
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:36.300]   "Dath warriors' kin have only just returned," Drost objected.
[01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:42.420]   "Not even dried their feet, and this is a good defensible spot."
[01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:44.260]   There were rumbles of ascent.
[01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:46.820]   "After our victory they don't want to leave.
[01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:48.740]   I've seen it before.
[01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:54.860]   Victory makes them feel secure, but our enemies know full, rins as canny as they come.
[01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:57.060]   One ought to feed her here again."
[01:36:57.060 --> 01:36:58.780]   And he had said as much to Adanna.
[01:36:58.780 --> 01:37:01.580]   "I agree," Adanna said.
[01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:03.620]   We won the last skirmish.
[01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:07.940]   Rin and her battled sheaves underestimated us, and did not scout well enough.
[01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:12.260]   But they will not repeat that mistake, and they will be back.
[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:17.020]   We faced over five hundred swords, put more than three hundred in their cans, but however
[01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:20.340]   many we slew some escaped.
[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:24.840]   They know where we are, and they will report back to Rin.
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:29.140]   This time they will be cautious, and Rin rules four realms now.
[01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:33.680]   She has the numbers to keep throwing warriors at us until we are overwhelmed."
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:36.020]   And Dathrin nodded dowily in agreement.
[01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:39.240]   "But where else is there?"
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:44.080]   "There are one or two other spots in these marshes," Drost said.
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:47.980]   "Not as good as here, but still.
[01:37:47.980 --> 01:37:52.180]   We need to change our tactics.
[01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:55.540]   After the families are staying in the marshes," Adanna interrupted.
[01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:58.760]   "I'm leading the warband out into Arden."
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:00.840]   "Arden?"
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:02.360]   Kraft mozzed above Adanna.
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:04.240]   "He didn't look pleased.
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:06.280]   The feathers of his neck suddenly bristling."
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:07.680]   "What?"
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:08.680]   Pundaffrin blurted.
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:14.520]   "Now that is," he paused, face-turning redder as he made an obvious effort to master his
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:16.600]   tongue unwise.
[01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:22.600]   "We cannot win the war hiding in these marshes.
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:28.180]   If Rin is to be defeated, and Arden, Navan, and dow and set free, then we must take the
[01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:30.380]   battle to her.
[01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:35.320]   We must become an enemy she fears."
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:38.400]   Winning one battle does not decide the war, Drost said.
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:42.380]   "You've done well, but we could lead Rin and Mary dance around these marshes."
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:46.020]   "I know full well that the war is not one."
[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:48.700]   Adanna said, her voice abruptly cold.
[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:50.980]   "Do not patronize me.
[01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:55.980]   I am not a ban, and I am no stranger to loss and hardship."
[01:38:55.980 --> 01:38:57.780]   She looked around at them all.
[01:38:57.780 --> 01:39:00.260]   "Each night I close my eyes.
[01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:03.380]   Each day I awake I see the same thing.
[01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:10.060]   My dead kin, my friends, cut down, my home, burning, my people.
[01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:13.580]   Who cares for them while we are here?"
[01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:15.780]   Never forget what Rin has taken from us.
[01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:22.780]   It is time we took something back, time we took the battle to her.
[01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:24.100]   Drost snorted.
[01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:28.500]   "We cannot face Rin in open battle," Pindathran growled.
[01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:30.820]   "Of course not," Adanna said.
[01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:36.860]   "We are to fewer numbers, less than two hundred swords, but we can use that to our advantage."
[01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:43.260]   "We can move, quickly, strike fast, disappear, strike elsewhere, show Rin and the people
[01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:49.660]   of Arden that we have teeth," Pindathran nodded, obviously considering it.
[01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:53.380]   "That lonely last so long," he said.
[01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:59.260]   "Indeed," Adanna said, "which is why the word needs to spread that Rin has lost a great
[01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:05.060]   battle that her regent everness is dead," her eyes flitted to Von and she took a deep
[01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:06.060]   breath.
[01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:10.820]   "That the rightful queen of Arden has returned.
[01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:12.700]   The people need to know.
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:14.260]   They have not been forgotten.
[01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:15.740]   I know them.
[01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:19.460]   They will join us if we offer them hope."
[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:21.700]   Pindathran glanced at Drost.
[01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:24.700]   They shared a long silence, then Drost nodded grimly.
[01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:30.740]   "When did the girly I used to bounce upon my knee become this daring battle chief I see
[01:40:30.740 --> 01:40:34.580]   before me," Pindathran said.
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:36.100]   Adanna just smiled.
[01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:40.820]   Although her eyes flickered in acknowledgement to Kamlin and Halion, who had had long conversations
[01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:48.180]   with her, discussing the options, though to be fair, much of this plan came from her.
[01:40:48.180 --> 01:40:53.600]   There was a flapping of wings and craft glided down to a light on the rock beside Adanna.
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:56.340]   "Drasil?" he groaned.
[01:40:56.340 --> 01:41:01.180]   "I am afraid we are not going to Drasil," Adanna said solemnly to the crow.
[01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:02.180]   "Wrong!
[01:41:02.180 --> 01:41:03.180]   Wrong!
[01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:04.220]   Wrong!"
[01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:09.500]   Craftcord, flapping his wings vehemently muttering, "God wall!
[01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:10.500]   Seven treasures!
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:11.500]   Brainer!
[01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:12.500]   Corbin!"
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:13.500]   Over and over.
[01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:19.300]   "We are needed here, Craft," Adanna said, reaching out a hand tentatively to touch the
[01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:21.700]   crow's ruffled feathers.
[01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:27.580]   He looked at her then with a disgusted squawk flapped into the air and soared away.
[01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:32.580]   Adanna watched him for a few moments, a duck smudged at faded quickly.
[01:41:32.580 --> 01:41:35.540]   Kamlin followed Adanna from the clearing.
[01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:40.100]   The sun was dipping behind the trees, a smell of cooking from the lake shore wafting over
[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:41.980]   made Kamlin's belly grumble.
[01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:47.220]   "What are you planning on doing with a plonder on the lake shore?" he asked Adanna, as he
[01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:48.900]   drew up alongside her.
[01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:53.900]   "Taking what we need, dumping the rest in the lake so that Rin can't use it," Adanna
[01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:54.900]   replied.
[01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:59.980]   "Make sure you keep the cloaks of black and gold," Kamlin said, "think they might come
[01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:00.980]   in handy."
[01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:06.940]   "I had thought exactly the same thing," Adanna said with a vicious smile.
[01:42:06.940 --> 01:42:10.700]   "My lady," a voice said behind them.
[01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:14.380]   It was Vaughn, his expression pensive.
[01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:17.300]   They halted to let him catch up.
[01:42:17.300 --> 01:42:18.300]   "Kraff?"
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:21.060]   The things he said.
[01:42:21.060 --> 01:42:27.620]   "I miss our friends as much as he does," Adanna sighed impatiently, interrupting.
[01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:31.940]   Corbin, Brinner, Dath, Gar, the others.
[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:34.340]   She felt silent, eyes distant.
[01:42:34.340 --> 01:42:42.580]   "But, much as I long to see them all again, I cannot dash off on a fool's errand to Drassel.
[01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:47.460]   The journey alone would take half a year, and I have a duty to my people.
[01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:49.860]   You misunderstand me," Vaughn said.
[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:56.620]   "It is the other things," he said about the god-war, about Drassel, and he took a deep
[01:42:56.620 --> 01:42:57.620]   breath.
[01:42:57.620 --> 01:43:03.220]   "I need to talk to you about what my father told me before he died."
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:05.420]   "About what?"
[01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:06.980]   Adanna said.
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:17.860]   "About the seven treasures," Vaughn said quietly, "I think I know where one of them is."
[01:43:17.860 --> 01:43:23.780]   Chapter 7 Corbin Corbin crouched beside Brinner and
[01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:27.900]   watched the healer run her hands over Storm's torso.
[01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:32.340]   The Wolfen had closed her eyes again, her breathing so shallow that she appeared dead.
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:37.780]   But as Brinner's fingers probed Storm's ribs, there was a faint growl and the flash of teeth,
[01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:40.060]   a storm culled a lip.
[01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:48.140]   "That hurts, then," Brinner murmured, "sorry, my darling," she soothed, fingers lifting a
[01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:52.980]   lip to look at the colour of Storm's dums, opening an eyelid, lifting legs and bending
[01:43:52.980 --> 01:43:55.220]   them at the joints.
[01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:57.020]   It must be bad.
[01:43:57.020 --> 01:44:02.300]   Brinner never calls anyone "my darling," even if they've lost body parts.
[01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:07.100]   Corbin looked up, hearing voices from beyond the ridge, gnar, organising a search of the
[01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:09.300]   area.
[01:44:09.300 --> 01:44:13.260]   While desperate to go and help continue the search for Corbin, worried that the others
[01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:17.540]   might miss something, she still couldn't bear to leave Storm's side.
[01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:20.260]   "Can you help her?"
[01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:22.260]   Corbin whispered.
[01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:24.260]   Brinner ignored her.
[01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:29.700]   Eventually she paused, sat straight, her head bowed in thought.
[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:31.740]   She blew out a long breath and nodded.
[01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:35.100]   Then with a quick movement she pulled out the file Corbin had seen her scraped giant's
[01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:37.660]   blood into.
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:42.460]   She scooped out some of the congealing blood and muttered as she lifted Storm's lip and
[01:44:42.460 --> 01:44:45.820]   ran her finger across Storm's lolling tongue.
[01:44:45.820 --> 01:44:51.460]   "Fuel, noviet erchlande argus niet."
[01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:58.420]   She repeated the phrase again and again, gently massaging Storm's throat to help her swallow.
[01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:03.420]   The air seemed to grow chill about them and Corbin shivered, feeling as if a spider had
[01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:05.820]   just crawled the length of her spine.
[01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:12.780]   Eventually, Storm shuddered, a spasm that rippled through her whole body.
[01:45:12.780 --> 01:45:16.900]   Storm was not sure if it was wishful thinking, but the Wolfen's breathing seemed to become
[01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:20.180]   stronger, steadier.
[01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:22.260]   Brinner stopped and looked at Corbin.
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:24.660]   "What have you done?"
[01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:25.660]   Corbin whispered.
[01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:31.620]   "Not a word to anyone," Brinner hissed fiercely, eyes locking onto Corbin's.
[01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:38.260]   "Without it, she is dead, she is too far gone, even now I cannot say."
[01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:43.420]   Star dropped down beside them, his usually emotional as face twisted with concern.
[01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:49.140]   "Well?" he said, looking between Brinner and the Wolfen.
[01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:54.020]   Brinner held Corbin's eyes still, waiting.
[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:58.180]   Corbin gave an imperceptible nod and then Brinner sighed and shook her head.
[01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:00.700]   "I don't know.
[01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:06.540]   She is battered, ribs broken, one lung punctured and collapsed.
[01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:11.860]   There is a hole through her shoulder and into her chest the size of my fist, if none of
[01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:17.420]   these things ends up still the loss of blood might," she shrugged.
[01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:19.220]   Her spirit strong.
[01:46:19.220 --> 01:46:23.220]   "None stronger," Gar said, "I.
[01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:26.380]   That may give her a chance," Brinner said.
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:28.580]   "Can she be moved?"
[01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:29.660]   Gar asked, "No."
[01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:35.180]   El said a guard, "Corbin, I need your eyes in the search for Corbin."
[01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:38.620]   Corbin nodded.
[01:46:38.620 --> 01:46:43.540]   She brushed her fingertips across Storm's muzzle, shared a lingering look with Brinner, and
[01:46:43.540 --> 01:46:47.620]   then she was hauling herself up the ridge.
[01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:51.980]   Corbin stood staring at the corpse of the Great Bear for a moment speechless.
[01:46:51.980 --> 01:46:57.580]   It was huge, swiped the height of a horse in three times as wide.
[01:46:57.580 --> 01:47:03.220]   The bear was a patchwork of wounds, a great flap of flesh hung loose above its shoulder
[01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:05.960]   more a tear than a cut.
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:11.020]   Half the length of its side had been opened with what looked like a sword cut, ribs shattered
[01:47:11.020 --> 01:47:14.980]   and flinks of white bones sprinkled amongst the red ruin.
[01:47:14.980 --> 01:47:21.220]   "Corbin," Corbin said, as she pointed to the sword wound in the bear's side.
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:26.660]   "That's not what killed it," Ferrell said, pointing away from the gaping slash in the
[01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:27.860]   bear's side.
[01:47:27.860 --> 01:47:30.140]   "That is."
[01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:34.420]   The bear's throat had been opened, the flesh lacerated and hanging.
[01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:38.300]   They'd all seen that type of wound before.
[01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:47.380]   "Storm," Gar said, "this is where we found them," Pac said, his voice roar with grief.
[01:47:47.380 --> 01:47:50.100]   "Where dar spear the giant?"
[01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:53.580]   "Describe this giant," Gar said.
[01:47:53.580 --> 01:48:01.100]   "Fear head, the colour of fresh straw, a war hammer," he looked, "Reecal, in charge,"
[01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:02.660]   and he was talking to Corbin.
[01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:04.660]   "Could it be?"
[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:08.020]   "Ildair," Leith said.
[01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:11.700]   Corbin felt a pulse of anger at the name saw Gar's stiffen.
[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:15.460]   Ildair was the warlord of the Jutton.
[01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:20.580]   He had slain Tuckle, Gar's father at Graham's hold and broken Gar's ribs when he had tried
[01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:23.620]   to avenge his dar's death.
[01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:27.860]   The ground showed the signs of more bears, at least another four, maybe more, as well
[01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:31.300]   as the other giants on foot.
[01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:34.940]   Tracks led northwards into the forest away from Drassel.
[01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:38.780]   Ildair and the Jutton had fought alongside J.L.
[01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:44.820]   of Iseltir, who in turn was allied to Nefair, so the logical conclusion was that the Jutton
[01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:49.780]   would have taken Corbin to Drassel, who would have joined the battle.
[01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:51.620]   It's their tracks headed north.
[01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:54.300]   "Where are they going?"
[01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:56.300]   Corbin asked.
[01:48:56.300 --> 01:49:00.500]   Dath moved first, breaking the spell the dead bear had put upon them.
[01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:06.100]   "Don't know, but we won't find them or a ban by standing here," he said.
[01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:08.340]   "When did this happen?"
[01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:09.340]   Gar asked.
[01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:13.020]   "Yesterday, after High Sun," Pax replied.
[01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:16.820]   "We've seen no sign of a camp," Corbin said.
[01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:23.820]   "No, cookfires, no we're slept upon, little spore, my guess, is that it's set off after
[01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:28.340]   capturing Corbin, so there must have been enough light to make a good start.
[01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:32.620]   If we follow their trail, see how much ground they covered before making camp, we'll get
[01:49:32.620 --> 01:49:36.580]   a better idea of how far ahead of us they are."
[01:49:36.580 --> 01:49:41.940]   Gar grunted in agreement, and together they moved up a steep slope, entering an area of
[01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:44.740]   dense vegetation.
[01:49:44.740 --> 01:49:51.380]   The hill leveled out and opened up, sunshine breaking through the canopy above.
[01:49:51.380 --> 01:49:56.820]   It was past High Sun, the day beginning its slow crawl towards night.
[01:49:56.820 --> 01:50:02.780]   To the south, Corbin could see Drasil, pillars of smoke spiraling from it.
[01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:06.100]   She looked back to the hills she was standing on, had the bear and giant tracks that led
[01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:10.100]   down the hill north away from Drasil.
[01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:14.580]   The sound of movement drew Corbin's attention, a rustling.
[01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:18.580]   Immediately her sword was in her fist, and she was seeking cover, the others following
[01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:22.460]   suit, dath with an arrow knocked.
[01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:25.940]   Lath pulled one of her throwing knives as big as a sword from the leather belt strapped
[01:50:25.940 --> 01:50:28.100]   across her chest.
[01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:34.140]   Gar signaled to the jihar before, and behind them, and then they waited.
[01:50:34.140 --> 01:50:39.780]   Beyond the peak of the hill, the forest was shrouded in shadow, hindering Corbin's vision,
[01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:45.300]   but the crunch of forest litter and approaching rustle amongst the foliage spoke of many feet.
[01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:52.300]   A figure appeared, crouched, moving carefully, dark shadows taking form behind it.
[01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:57.700]   Iron glinted, then Gar was stepping from behind a tree, sheathing his sword and striding
[01:50:57.700 --> 01:50:59.700]   down the hill.
[01:50:59.700 --> 01:51:07.660]   "Well, Matt," he said to Tahir, the shieldman of Halen, boy king of Isiltir.
[01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:13.180]   The warrior gave a lopsided grin of relief and took Gar's forearm in the warrior grip.
[01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:17.420]   He was not overly tall, but was broad and thick-muscled, his arms looking too long for
[01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:19.900]   his body.
[01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:24.860]   Dark hollows ringed his eyes, and there was a long tear across the shoulder of his chain
[01:51:24.860 --> 01:51:27.820]   mount shirt, blood caked around it.
[01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:31.060]   "Been looking for you," Tahir said.
[01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:37.500]   "And you found us," Gar said, "how did you know where to search?"
[01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:41.980]   One of my lads saw Michael defending the door to the northern tunnel.
[01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:45.540]   "You don't offend a door, for nothing."
[01:51:45.540 --> 01:51:51.460]   We retreated out of the main gate, made it to the forest, and started circling this way.
[01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:56.860]   More men appeared behind him, 40, 50, others hidden in the forest gloom, most wearing the
[01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:59.540]   red cloaks of Isiltir.
[01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:05.340]   Taken us all night and half the day, forest was crawling with Khadoshim and Vintal.
[01:52:05.340 --> 01:52:09.900]   "Think we've taught them to fear the forest better, though."
[01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:12.860]   A rumble of agreement spread through the warriors behind him.
[01:52:12.860 --> 01:52:14.700]   "Where's Halen?"
[01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:17.300]   Gar asked, and Tahir's face dropped.
[01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:18.980]   "I don't know.
[01:52:18.980 --> 01:52:21.340]   I tried to find him."
[01:52:21.340 --> 01:52:24.340]   Tahir's mouth twisted with something between pain and shame.
[01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:27.380]   "He's a resourceful lad," Gar said.
[01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:30.060]   "I'd wager he's found a hole to hide in."
[01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:33.820]   "I hope so," Tahir replied, a tremor in his voice.
[01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:35.820]   "How many were you?"
[01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:42.740]   Gar asked him, "146 swords that can fight," Tahir said, another dozen wounded.
[01:52:42.740 --> 01:52:46.660]   "We've done well, saving so many," Gar said.
[01:52:46.660 --> 01:52:52.980]   "I, well, slow and steady wins the race," as my old man used to say.
[01:52:52.980 --> 01:52:55.540]   Tahir looked around, "Where's Corbin?"
[01:52:55.540 --> 01:53:01.340]   "Taken, by the Joton, we have just found his trail."
[01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:03.220]   Tahir sculled and spat.
[01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:07.180]   "Giants," he muttered, then looked back to Gar.
[01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:11.300]   "So, what do we do now?"
[01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:13.180]   Gar looked at him and blinked.
[01:53:13.180 --> 01:53:19.660]   "With Corbin and Mike Algon, Gar is our natural leader now, and not just for us, but for all
[01:53:19.660 --> 01:53:21.540]   who fought at Drassel.
[01:53:21.540 --> 01:53:25.700]   He is Lord of the Jia and Corbin's first sword."
[01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:31.100]   All Corbin wanted to do was find Corbin, but with survivors scattered throughout the
[01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:33.420]   forest, Gar had more to consider.
[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:38.460]   "I'm going after Corbin," Gar said, and turned away to stare at the trail that led
[01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:39.460]   Northwoods.
[01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:42.220]   Tahir gripped his arm.
[01:53:42.220 --> 01:53:44.980]   "What about us?" he asked.
[01:53:44.980 --> 01:53:50.460]   "You and your warriors will rest a while, drink, eat, tend to your wounds."
[01:53:50.460 --> 01:53:56.340]   "I don't just mean us," Tahir said, waving at his hand.
[01:53:56.340 --> 01:54:00.260]   "I mean, the warband of Drassel.
[01:54:00.260 --> 01:54:03.740]   Me, still live, can you not hear them still fighting?
[01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:08.340]   For Corbin, you cannot just abandon them."
[01:54:08.340 --> 01:54:12.500]   Gar stared at him, face twitching.
[01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:16.780]   Corbin crouched beside the burned-out fire and brushed the ash with her fingers.
[01:54:16.780 --> 01:54:22.740]   It was cold, not even the memory of heat lingering within it.
[01:54:22.740 --> 01:54:27.460]   She glanced up, saw a daff at the edge of shadow poking at a mound of bear-dung.
[01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:30.460]   It was sunset.
[01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:33.940]   The forest was slipping into layers of shadow.
[01:54:33.940 --> 01:54:38.620]   After talking with Tahir, Gar had sent out scouts to see if the survivors of Drassel could
[01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:40.260]   be brought together.
[01:54:40.260 --> 01:54:46.220]   Corbin had left with daff and collar to find the giant's camp.
[01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:52.300]   She sprang up and ran from the site, easily following the path the giants had left.
[01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:56.100]   They are overly confident and making no effort to hide their passage.
[01:54:56.100 --> 01:54:59.100]   They would not think that we were hunting them.
[01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:03.780]   If running I could reach them, it may be possible to steal Corbin back in the darkness.
[01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:07.220]   It's too dark, we'll lose their trail.
[01:55:07.220 --> 01:55:12.500]   Daff called after her, but she ignored him, just ran on into the forest, following the
[01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:15.540]   tracks up a steep incline.
[01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:21.500]   She climbed it and stopped, kicking at a moss-covered stone, her heart sinking as she realized the
[01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:24.380]   implications of what she could see.
[01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:28.480]   The old giants rode, she said to daff and collar, as they joined her.
[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:31.300]   It had been rebuilt by J.L.'s war-band.
[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:33.140]   And they're moving fast.
[01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:38.580]   "Aye," color said, "wherever they're going, they want to get there quickly and are not
[01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:40.740]   worried about any pursuit."
[01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:46.180]   "Probably think we're all a bit busy with Nefair and Drassel," Daff added.
[01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:47.500]   He looked at Corbin.
[01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:49.940]   "How far ahead do you think they are?"
[01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:52.380]   "A day," Corbin grunted.
[01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:56.020]   "If they stick to that ruined road, maybe ten, twelve leagues?"
[01:55:56.020 --> 01:56:01.980]   "We're not going to catch them this night then," Corbin sucked in an old breath.
[01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:03.980]   "No," she growled.
[01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:06.180]   "What do you want to do?"
[01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:07.180]   Daff asked her.
[01:56:07.180 --> 01:56:13.220]   "I want to keep running, keep moving until we find them, find him, but there would be
[01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:15.300]   no quick rescue now.
[01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:19.900]   They would be fortunate to catch them in half or ten nights, probably longer if their bears
[01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:21.660]   have an open run.
[01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:24.740]   Back to Gah," she said.
[01:56:24.740 --> 01:56:28.940]   They had made it back to camping good time, considering they were travelling almost blind,
[01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:34.060]   the moonlight little more than a shimmer above the forest canopy.
[01:56:34.060 --> 01:56:38.380]   Warriors were everywhere, clustered around small fires that had been surrounded by wicker
[01:56:38.380 --> 01:56:41.060]   panels to hide their glow.
[01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:44.980]   Corbin saw Gah standing beside a larger fire with a group around him.
[01:56:44.980 --> 01:56:49.060]   Tahir was there, as well as others whom she was pleased to see.
[01:56:49.060 --> 01:56:53.700]   Wolf and his bear pelt, her notched ax resting across his shoulder.
[01:56:53.700 --> 01:57:00.540]   Javed, the pit-fighter, small and wiry, a giant out-lined behind them.
[01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:04.620]   Gah saw her enter the glade, and their eyes met.
[01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:08.380]   Corbin nodded, signaling that she'd found the giant's camp.
[01:57:08.380 --> 01:57:13.380]   "We shall strike, but after I still now," Javed said.
[01:57:13.380 --> 01:57:15.380]   "They'd not be expecting that.
[01:57:15.380 --> 01:57:18.580]   Thivintallen are in there."
[01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:21.140]   Those are barely contained rage, edging his voice.
[01:57:21.140 --> 01:57:26.220]   "Like us, he's there, the man who gave me this."
[01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:31.260]   He twisted to show the scar burned into the back of his shoulder, a twisting spiral.
[01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:39.180]   He and his kind did this, and worse to many of us, Javed said, waving a hand at his warriors.
[01:57:39.180 --> 01:57:42.260]   "Angry murmurs spread amongst them.
[01:57:42.260 --> 01:57:47.660]   Kick a stone in anger, you'll hurt your foot," Tahir said.
[01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:49.900]   Javed just stared at him.
[01:57:49.900 --> 01:57:53.940]   The giant behind them laughed at low rumbling-like drums.
[01:57:53.940 --> 01:57:58.180]   "Just something my old man used to say," Tahir muttered.
[01:57:58.180 --> 01:58:01.220]   "And what the hell does it mean?"
[01:58:01.220 --> 01:58:02.220]   Javed scald.
[01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:07.020]   "That acting from anger will get you killed," Gah said.
[01:58:07.020 --> 01:58:09.460]   "Angry is the enemy."
[01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:11.260]   He turned to the group close to him.
[01:58:11.260 --> 01:58:17.100]   "Fakan, of the Benothi," Gah continued, "what would your clan advise?"
[01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:24.900]   The giant stepped forwards into the farlight, a double-blading axe silhouetted across his
[01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:25.900]   shoulder.
[01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:29.980]   Balah, one eye, is wounded on the edge of life and death.
[01:58:29.980 --> 01:58:32.780]   "Etlin will not leave him.
[01:58:32.780 --> 01:58:37.900]   We will not fight without her," Gah nodded thoughtfully.
[01:58:37.900 --> 01:58:40.780]   "How many of your kin are with you?"
[01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:46.860]   "A score. perhaps more are scattered in form," the giant shrugged.
[01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:50.740]   "I will send Brynna with you when you return to them."
[01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:51.740]   "Good."
[01:58:51.740 --> 01:58:54.500]   "Etlin, bad me, ask for her."
[01:58:54.500 --> 01:58:58.180]   "We cannot just do nothing," Javed snapped.
[01:58:58.180 --> 01:59:02.860]   "I do not intend to do nothing," Gah said.
[01:59:02.860 --> 01:59:09.580]   Other voices joined in, each proposing a different way forward attacks, ambushes, strategies.
[01:59:09.580 --> 01:59:12.300]   Things could go on all night.
[01:59:12.300 --> 01:59:16.220]   Coraline slipped across the glade, moving beyond the small council to the side of the
[01:59:16.220 --> 01:59:17.220]   glade.
[01:59:17.220 --> 01:59:23.620]   A makeshift rope ladder hung over the edge, another fire flickering below by the river's
[01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:24.620]   bank.
[01:59:24.620 --> 01:59:27.900]   Coraline climbed nimbly down to find Brynna with storm.
[01:59:27.900 --> 01:59:33.660]   A pharaoh was there too, sitting with his back to the slope, eyes closed, a big hand resting
[01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:35.660]   upon storm's shoulder.
[01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:37.380]   "How is she?"
[01:59:37.380 --> 01:59:39.340]   Corinne asked.
[01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:43.720]   When I looked at her with sad eyes, tears glittering in the firelight.
[01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:49.420]   "I fear she will not win this fight," the healer said.
[01:59:49.420 --> 01:59:51.180]   Coraline's heart lurched in her chest.
[01:59:51.180 --> 01:59:54.260]   "But she used magic," said a spell.
[01:59:54.260 --> 01:59:56.260]   "But what you did?"
[01:59:56.260 --> 02:00:03.740]   "It has helped," Brynna said, giving her strength, but her wounds.
[02:00:03.740 --> 02:00:07.740]   She looked at Pharrell, then lowered her voice to little more than a whisper.
[02:00:07.740 --> 02:00:11.380]   "And I used giant's blood.
[02:00:11.380 --> 02:00:15.620]   Another wolfan or something closer to her own species would have more power."
[02:00:15.620 --> 02:00:18.860]   "There is a dead bear?
[02:00:18.860 --> 02:00:20.340]   Half a leak from here?"
[02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:25.020]   Coraline said, "One of those that jotting giants ride."
[02:00:25.020 --> 02:00:28.500]   Brynna reached into her cloak and removed an empty file.
[02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:35.020]   "Feel this with its blood," she said, taking Coraline's hand and closing her fingers about
[02:00:35.020 --> 02:00:36.500]   it.
[02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:39.740]   She glanced at Storm at the wolfan's shallow breathing.
[02:00:39.740 --> 02:00:45.260]   "And be quick about it," Coraline was.
[02:00:45.260 --> 02:00:49.620]   Most of the camp was sleeping when she returned from her gristy task.
[02:00:49.620 --> 02:00:53.860]   Gar and the other leaders were still in deep conversation.
[02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:58.860]   Brynna was alone with Storm, the small fire crackling, casting shadows across the healer
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:01.460]   and wolfan.
[02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:07.860]   As a word, Brynna took the file and massaged the fluid into Storm's gums and tongue.
[02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:16.380]   "Fuel, novit, a laerte, a schlante argas nyart," Brynna muttered, over and over, her voice
[02:01:16.380 --> 02:01:20.820]   sounding like a stick scratching on slate.
[02:01:20.820 --> 02:01:23.020]   Coraline's flesh goose-bumped.
[02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:28.140]   The fire seemed to dim and then flare, a twig popped.
[02:01:28.140 --> 02:01:33.140]   The wolf and stirred, lifting her head to regard Brynna with her amber wolfan eyes.
[02:01:33.140 --> 02:01:36.220]   "Come back to us," Brynna whispered.
[02:01:36.220 --> 02:01:39.380]   "Corbon needs you."
[02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:42.300]   Storm's legs twitched and she gave a weak rumbling growl.
[02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:45.740]   Then with a sigh, she laid her head back on the turf.
[02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:51.700]   "Thank you," Brynna said to Coraline, looking weary.
[02:01:51.700 --> 02:01:56.820]   Dirts skitted about them, and dath, colour, and lathe appeared out of the darkness, waking
[02:01:56.820 --> 02:01:57.820]   up.
[02:01:57.820 --> 02:02:00.580]   "How is she?" dath asked.
[02:02:00.580 --> 02:02:03.820]   "A little stronger," Brynna said.
[02:02:03.820 --> 02:02:07.780]   "We'll take it in turns to watch over her," Pharrell said.
[02:02:07.780 --> 02:02:10.220]   "Even you must need to sleep."
[02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:15.780]   "Well, for once you may be right," Brynna muttered.
[02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:18.980]   She curled down beside the fire, pulling her cloak over her head.
[02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:26.740]   "Wake me if there is any change, and no going to sleep on watch."
[02:02:26.740 --> 02:02:31.380]   The bony finger poked out of the cloak and wagged at them all.
[02:02:31.380 --> 02:02:35.980]   Within moments, Brynna's breathing changed, became slower and deeper.
[02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:39.420]   "So?" dath whispered to Coraline once they were
[02:02:39.420 --> 02:02:41.620]   all sure that Brynna was soundly asleep.
[02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:43.620]   "When do we leave?"
[02:02:43.620 --> 02:02:46.100]   "What do you mean?"
[02:02:46.100 --> 02:02:47.100]   Coraline asked.
[02:02:47.100 --> 02:02:49.180]   "You'll be going after Corbon.
[02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:52.020]   We're Corbon too."
[02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:55.500]   Coraline had decided to leave a little before first light, to slip away before the camp
[02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:58.740]   woke and started asking her questions.
[02:02:58.740 --> 02:03:02.820]   She needed to use every moment of daylight possible.
[02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:06.060]   Perhaps, leave a message for Gar.
[02:03:06.060 --> 02:03:09.940]   It was clear that he was needed here, that his duties would force him to stay and oversee
[02:03:09.940 --> 02:03:12.140]   the fight against N'there.
[02:03:12.140 --> 02:03:15.260]   "You can't come," Coraline said.
[02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:20.020]   "Pharrell and Laith will be too noisy, too slow."
[02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:21.820]   Pharrell leaned forwards.
[02:03:21.820 --> 02:03:24.180]   "Bands, my friend.
[02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:25.180]   More than that.
[02:03:25.180 --> 02:03:26.340]   Closer than kin.
[02:03:26.340 --> 02:03:29.220]   I'm going after him with you or without you."
[02:03:29.220 --> 02:03:30.220]   He shrugged.
[02:03:30.220 --> 02:03:35.140]   "I'd rather we travel together, but I'll not be staying here."
[02:03:35.140 --> 02:03:38.140]   Coraline looked at them all, saw the resolve in their eyes.
[02:03:38.140 --> 02:03:43.020]   "All right, then," she said, "before dawn."
[02:03:43.020 --> 02:03:48.500]   Morning came grey and damp, false dawn giving a half-light that helped Coraline to see beyond
[02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:53.940]   the fireglow they'd kept crackling all night to give Storm a little warmth.
[02:03:53.940 --> 02:04:01.540]   Pharrell, Daph, Colour, and Laith had all stayed, taking it in terms to watch over Storm.
[02:04:01.540 --> 02:04:07.740]   Now, silently, they all stood, checked weapons, and packs.
[02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:14.300]   "I would come with you, if not for Storm," Brynn said as she stirred within her cloak.
[02:04:14.300 --> 02:04:17.940]   "We know," Coraline answered.
[02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:20.140]   Brynn checked on the sleeping wolfan.
[02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:24.180]   "Her heart beats stronger," she said.
[02:04:24.180 --> 02:04:29.100]   "That is good news," Coraline grinned.
[02:04:29.100 --> 02:04:33.260]   She crouched beside the wolfan and ran her fingers through the thick fur of her neck,
[02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:36.580]   then leaned forwards and kissed Storm's head.
[02:04:36.580 --> 02:04:40.740]   "I'll be back with Corbin," she whispered.
[02:04:40.740 --> 02:04:45.620]   "Bring him back," Brynn said, watching them leave.
[02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:49.740]   "I mean to, or die in the trying."
[02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:53.540]   The camp in the glade above was still and silent.
[02:04:53.540 --> 02:04:57.020]   Coraline and the others picked their way through the sleeping figures.
[02:04:57.020 --> 02:05:01.500]   As they slipped amongst the trees, a figure stepped out in front of them.
[02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:07.460]   Gar, he had a pack slung across his back, a grim look upon his face.
[02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:10.940]   He nodded as he looked fiercely at the small gathering.
[02:05:10.940 --> 02:05:11.940]   "Good.
[02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:15.260]   Let's be after him then."
[02:05:15.260 --> 02:05:20.280]   "We thought you were needed here that you would have to stay," Coraline said.
[02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:22.380]   He gave for a withering look.
[02:05:22.380 --> 02:05:29.440]   "Only death would stop me going after Ben."
[02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:36.380]   Chapter 8 Corbin Corbin woke to pain.
[02:05:36.380 --> 02:05:42.700]   He opened his eyes, stared up at a dappled canopy of leaf and branch, grey lights leaking
[02:05:42.700 --> 02:05:44.540]   through it.
[02:05:44.540 --> 02:05:48.660]   It was passing him by, like clouds scudding across the sky.
[02:05:48.660 --> 02:05:49.660]   "No.
[02:05:49.660 --> 02:05:50.660]   Not the trees.
[02:05:50.660 --> 02:05:58.420]   It is I that are moving, and I am in form," he realised, still in form.
[02:05:58.420 --> 02:06:00.820]   He felt relief at that.
[02:06:00.820 --> 02:06:03.220]   Being in form was not such a bad thing.
[02:06:03.220 --> 02:06:07.460]   He liked the forest, and it also meant that he was not a thousand leeks from Drassel and
[02:06:07.460 --> 02:06:11.340]   his friends, if any of them had survived.
[02:06:11.340 --> 02:06:15.820]   The constant rocking, bumping motion wasn't such a good thing, making his chest spike
[02:06:15.820 --> 02:06:21.020]   with pain and exacerbating the deep dull throb in his knee, pulsing out in time with
[02:06:21.020 --> 02:06:22.100]   his heartbeat.
[02:06:22.100 --> 02:06:31.060]   Also, there was a terrible stink in his nose, musky and stale, making him want to gag.
[02:06:31.060 --> 02:06:33.700]   Time passed in something of a haze.
[02:06:33.700 --> 02:06:38.660]   His mind drifted and he thought to the other world of his meeting with Michael.
[02:06:38.660 --> 02:06:40.420]   He used me.
[02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:43.100]   He manipulated me, lied to me.
[02:06:43.100 --> 02:06:45.340]   But his words had also rung true.
[02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:48.340]   He needed to find his friends to be at their side.
[02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:49.340]   How?
[02:06:49.340 --> 02:06:52.500]   That is the question.
[02:06:52.500 --> 02:06:58.940]   When I am broken and battered, a prisoner travelling Elion knows where.
[02:06:58.940 --> 02:07:03.820]   He moved his head slowly from side to side, saw that he was on a makeshift litter that
[02:07:03.820 --> 02:07:07.100]   was being dragged through the forest.
[02:07:07.100 --> 02:07:12.760]   Behind him, a huge figure loomed, thick with fur, a black snout and muzzle, yellow teeth
[02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:18.580]   edging its jaw, a bear, one of the Jotons bears.
[02:07:18.580 --> 02:07:24.660]   Their face reared over him, pale and blond-haired, a long braided moustache drooping down almost
[02:07:24.660 --> 02:07:27.260]   a Corbin's face.
[02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:31.020]   Corbin recognized him as one of the giants that had dragged him away from storm.
[02:07:31.020 --> 02:07:38.300]   "I'll kill you," Corbin hissed, instinctively reaching for his sword.
[02:07:38.300 --> 02:07:42.340]   When his fingers reached the empty scabbard, he remembered that he'd left it in the body
[02:07:42.340 --> 02:07:49.620]   of a giant, back in the glade where he instalmed, fought and slain three of his giant's kin.
[02:07:49.620 --> 02:07:54.060]   The giant's eyes watched Corbin's gasping breathlessness and grunted.
[02:07:54.060 --> 02:08:00.860]   "You'll not be killing any more of us Joton today," the giant said in stilted speech.
[02:08:00.860 --> 02:08:09.100]   "But I like your spirit," he chuckled, "there's fire in this pup's belly yet."
[02:08:09.100 --> 02:08:15.540]   "Hala," he called over his shoulder, "seems you'll make a healer after all."
[02:08:15.540 --> 02:08:22.900]   "I've been one for four hundred years, you idiot," a voice called back.
[02:08:22.900 --> 02:08:27.340]   The giant looked back at Corbin and checked the binding of his legsplint, sending jolts
[02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:29.100]   of pain through Corbin.
[02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:34.260]   "Don't go dying on us," the giant said.
[02:08:34.260 --> 02:08:38.180]   Another giant face appeared beside this one, red-haired and glowering.
[02:08:38.180 --> 02:08:44.420]   "Here in his wolf and killed her on, Ralph and Lut," it rumbled, reaching round with the
[02:08:44.420 --> 02:08:49.060]   hand the size of a shovel and cutting Corbin across the head.
[02:08:49.060 --> 02:08:52.580]   Just the blow was painful enough, but the fire it ignited in Corbin's chest was like
[02:08:52.580 --> 02:08:58.020]   a hammer strike and he screamed, the world feeding to darkness.
[02:08:58.020 --> 02:09:02.620]   The last sound he heard was giant voices yelling at each other.
[02:09:02.620 --> 02:09:07.180]   "Drink this," a voice said.
[02:09:07.180 --> 02:09:11.780]   Something was shoved into his hand a bowl, and to his surprise he found that he was propped
[02:09:11.780 --> 02:09:17.820]   up against the trunk of a tree, a rope tying him to the wide bowl, not that I can get up
[02:09:17.820 --> 02:09:19.940]   and run away.
[02:09:19.940 --> 02:09:26.100]   Two giants were crouched before him, both of them cloaked in a twilight gloom of fawn.
[02:09:26.100 --> 02:09:29.740]   One of them was the blonde giant he talked to earlier.
[02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:34.500]   Beyond them he heard the familiar sound of camp making, shadowy figures moving at the
[02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:37.220]   edge of his sight.
[02:09:37.220 --> 02:09:44.500]   "Drink," the voice said, a huge hand wrapping around his and lifting the bowl to his lips.
[02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:50.020]   Corbin sniffed it, wrinkling his nose at the familiar earthly smell.
[02:09:50.020 --> 02:09:51.780]   "Brot," he muttered.
[02:09:51.780 --> 02:09:56.940]   "You know, Brot?" the voice said in surprise.
[02:09:56.940 --> 02:10:01.820]   Corbin looked into the gloom and saw that one of the dark figures before him was a woman.
[02:10:01.820 --> 02:10:06.740]   Her face slabs of bone highlighted by the dim gleam of moonlight.
[02:10:06.740 --> 02:10:10.180]   "I?" Corbin mumbled.
[02:10:10.180 --> 02:10:12.740]   He sniffed suspiciously at the bowl.
[02:10:12.740 --> 02:10:15.300]   "Go on," the voice said.
[02:10:15.300 --> 02:10:19.180]   "If we wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already."
[02:10:19.180 --> 02:10:21.860]   "That's a fair point.
[02:10:21.860 --> 02:10:23.960]   Why haven't they killed me?"
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:25.500]   He took a sip.
[02:10:25.500 --> 02:10:29.900]   The Brot's closer to porridge and consistency than fluid.
[02:10:29.900 --> 02:10:33.780]   After swallowing, he felt an after-taste, something bitter.
[02:10:33.780 --> 02:10:38.500]   "It's not the same," Corbin said, as what.
[02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:40.940]   As what Balor gave me.
[02:10:40.940 --> 02:10:43.180]   There was a pause.
[02:10:43.180 --> 02:10:51.380]   The giant shared a look.
[02:10:51.380 --> 02:10:56.860]   "Balor, one eye," the blond-haired male asked.
[02:10:56.860 --> 02:11:00.660]   "Aye," Corbin said, "something else in this."
[02:11:00.660 --> 02:11:02.660]   "Golden seal."
[02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:03.660]   Another silence.
[02:11:03.660 --> 02:11:08.100]   "Aye," the female giant said, "she almost sounded pleased."
[02:11:08.100 --> 02:11:08.260]   "Golden seal to fight infection," Brin always said, "the worse it tastes, the better it is for you."
[02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:11.180]   I never quite believed that bit.
[02:11:11.180 --> 02:11:13.740]   Another figure loomed out of the shadows.
[02:11:13.740 --> 02:11:21.100]   "Bog-er," the giant rumbled, and his captors parted to let this one crouch down before Corbin.
[02:11:21.100 --> 02:11:28.220]   "Aidram," the new arrival said, and a moment later Corbin heard flint being struck, sparks
[02:11:28.220 --> 02:11:32.420]   catching on a torch and light flared.
[02:11:32.420 --> 02:11:35.900]   Corbin blinked, looked away a moment.
[02:11:35.900 --> 02:11:39.340]   "Look, had me."
[02:11:39.340 --> 02:11:43.380]   The new voice said, a grating rumbles stern and grim.
[02:11:43.380 --> 02:11:46.980]   A hand gripped Corbin's face and lifted his chin.
[02:11:46.980 --> 02:11:51.140]   He was looking at another blonde giant, a thick warrior braid in his hair, threaded with
[02:11:51.140 --> 02:11:53.860]   a red gold wire.
[02:11:53.860 --> 02:11:58.100]   This one had a wide bandage wrapped around his shoulder and chest, a duck's stain at
[02:11:58.100 --> 02:11:59.100]   its centre.
[02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:05.460]   "You are ill there," King of the Jotun, Corbin said.
[02:12:05.460 --> 02:12:09.700]   "Warlord, not King, ill there mermaid."
[02:12:09.700 --> 02:12:13.780]   "But, who are you?"
[02:12:13.780 --> 02:12:17.020]   "Why am I still breathing?"
[02:12:17.020 --> 02:12:18.020]   Corbin asked.
[02:12:18.020 --> 02:12:21.820]   "A slew your bear, three of your kin in the glade."
[02:12:21.820 --> 02:12:25.220]   With a lot of help from storm, "Why would you keep me alive?"
[02:12:25.220 --> 02:12:31.580]   "You do not question me," Ill dare said.
[02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:36.160]   Then with one thick finger, prodded Corbin in his ribs.
[02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:38.220]   Corbin suppressed a scream.
[02:12:38.220 --> 02:12:40.860]   It came out as a gurgled hiss.
[02:12:40.860 --> 02:12:46.380]   Ill dare's hand brushed over Corbin's torn circote, rested on the sigil of the bright
[02:12:46.380 --> 02:12:53.300]   star stitched upon his chest, felt his male shirt rolling links between his fingers.
[02:12:53.300 --> 02:12:58.780]   He grunted approvingly, then moved onto Corbin's arm ring, wrapped around his bicep.
[02:12:58.780 --> 02:13:03.940]   It had been gifted to him in Drassel, a spiral of dark iron veined with a silver thread,
[02:13:03.940 --> 02:13:07.700]   a snarling wolf and head at each end.
[02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:12.820]   It was a thing of beauty, more so because it reminded Corbin of the night back in Drassel
[02:13:12.820 --> 02:13:17.300]   when the whole of the warband had pledged their loyalty to him, and he had sworn his
[02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:20.460]   oath to them in return.
[02:13:20.460 --> 02:13:24.460]   He felt a lump rise in his throat and blinked away tears.
[02:13:24.460 --> 02:13:29.220]   "Who are you," Ill dare asked him again.
[02:13:29.220 --> 02:13:34.820]   "No one," Corbin grunted, feeling a surge of bitter despair at that admission.
[02:13:34.820 --> 02:13:38.580]   "Certainly not the bright star everyone believed I was.
[02:13:38.580 --> 02:13:40.300]   I even came to believe it.
[02:13:40.300 --> 02:13:42.260]   I am the greatest of fools.
[02:13:42.260 --> 02:13:44.340]   That is who I am."
[02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:51.740]   "There is giant skill in this," Ill dare observed, fingers running over the spiral of
[02:13:51.740 --> 02:13:53.460]   the arm ring.
[02:13:53.460 --> 02:13:57.940]   At Graham's old warrior stood about you.
[02:13:57.940 --> 02:14:04.820]   You commanded, and others listened, and yesterday men came to save you.
[02:14:04.820 --> 02:14:09.680]   He moved closer, face almost touching Corbin's his small dark eye staring.
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:12.780]   "I do not think you are no one.
[02:14:12.780 --> 02:14:13.940]   Start with your name.
[02:14:13.940 --> 02:14:16.220]   Tell me that."
[02:14:16.220 --> 02:14:18.220]   Corbin clamped his lips together.
[02:14:18.220 --> 02:14:21.660]   "I could hurt you," Ill dare said.
[02:14:21.660 --> 02:14:27.740]   Matter of factly, hand opening and resting lightly upon Corbin's injured knee.
[02:14:27.740 --> 02:14:29.780]   Corbin sucked in a breath but said nothing.
[02:14:29.780 --> 02:14:34.940]   "Your name," Ill dare said, flexing his fingers.
[02:14:34.940 --> 02:14:40.620]   "Something for something," Corbin said, as calmly as he could manage.
[02:14:40.620 --> 02:14:43.980]   Ill dare stared at him a long, sweat-fuelled moment.
[02:14:43.980 --> 02:14:49.180]   Then a smile cracked the slabs of the giant's face, his moustache twitching.
[02:14:49.180 --> 02:14:53.180]   "You have Stone's little man.
[02:14:53.180 --> 02:14:55.540]   I'll give you that."
[02:14:55.540 --> 02:15:03.220]   Bargaining with me, at a time like this, very well, something for something.
[02:15:03.220 --> 02:15:06.300]   "Now, what is your name?"
[02:15:06.300 --> 02:15:13.140]   "I am Corbin Ben Thannan," Corbin said, lifting his chin high.
[02:15:13.140 --> 02:15:14.940]   "That is who I am.
[02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:17.380]   My father's son no more, no less."
[02:15:17.380 --> 02:15:22.860]   At that moment he had never missed his dial more fiercely nor felt so proud of his memory.
[02:15:22.860 --> 02:15:29.100]   Ill dare nodded thoughtfully, as if he were turning the name over in his mind.
[02:15:29.100 --> 02:15:34.220]   "All right then," the giant finally said, "ask your question."
[02:15:34.220 --> 02:15:37.180]   "Where are you taking me?"
[02:15:37.180 --> 02:15:44.380]   Corbin asked, away from Drassel and his cursed forest, Ill dare said, looking up at the shifting
[02:15:44.380 --> 02:15:47.220]   shadows in impenetrable trees around them.
[02:15:47.220 --> 02:15:48.220]   "Where?"
[02:15:48.220 --> 02:15:52.840]   Corbin repeated, "A place you know well enough.
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:59.900]   We are going to Gramm's hold."
[02:15:59.900 --> 02:16:04.780]   Chapter 9 Fidele.
[02:16:04.780 --> 02:16:09.380]   Fidele walked the lines of their camp, nodding to guards, offering a word of encouragement
[02:16:09.380 --> 02:16:11.220]   here and there.
[02:16:11.220 --> 02:16:17.620]   These loomed towering colossi that transformed daylight into perpetual twilight.
[02:16:17.620 --> 02:16:22.700]   Within this shadowed world, the warband of Ripper camped, close to a thousand men, five
[02:16:22.700 --> 02:16:25.220]   hundred leagues from home.
[02:16:25.220 --> 02:16:29.780]   They must wonder why they are here so far from home, caught up in a war they hardly
[02:16:29.780 --> 02:16:33.820]   understand, a war that I barely understand.
[02:16:33.820 --> 02:16:40.060]   What she did know though was that her son was at the heart of it, Nafair.
[02:16:40.060 --> 02:16:43.140]   Had the thought of him a tide of emotion swept through her.
[02:16:43.140 --> 02:16:47.340]   "Shock, he is allied to the cadet shim, my own son.
[02:16:47.340 --> 02:16:50.660]   How could he choose to be part of such a great evil?"
[02:16:50.660 --> 02:16:56.660]   Anger, that he had not chosen differently, that he had not stood for what was right.
[02:16:56.660 --> 02:17:01.580]   He is naive, has trusted flattering words into septive tongues and walked the wrong
[02:17:01.580 --> 02:17:02.580]   path.
[02:17:02.580 --> 02:17:09.820]   Betrayal, that he had chosen Caledus over her, a point made so clear during her trial.
[02:17:09.820 --> 02:17:13.740]   Regret, that she had not seen the course he was treading earlier and done something
[02:17:13.740 --> 02:17:17.500]   to help him while there had still been time.
[02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:24.620]   Sadness, no, something far deeper than that, more akin to grief.
[02:17:24.620 --> 02:17:29.460]   It almost felt as if he had died that she had lost him forever.
[02:17:29.460 --> 02:17:36.620]   Not forever, there is still hope for him, there must be, hatred.
[02:17:36.620 --> 02:17:43.300]   Caledus, the catalyst and centre of her fury, a cadet shim demon made flesh, his will set
[02:17:43.300 --> 02:17:48.140]   on corrupting Nafair and bending him to his purposes.
[02:17:48.140 --> 02:17:52.020]   Threaded between and amongst all those emotions was one more.
[02:17:52.020 --> 02:17:53.020]   Love.
[02:17:53.020 --> 02:17:58.580]   A mother's love for her son, built upon the vulnerable child she had nursed at her breast,
[02:17:58.580 --> 02:18:01.340]   whom she had nurtured and protected.
[02:18:01.340 --> 02:18:06.020]   A fierce love that had always seen the best in him, that believed in his ability, his
[02:18:06.020 --> 02:18:09.740]   strength and intellect, believed in him.
[02:18:09.740 --> 02:18:13.380]   A love that still fueled a hope that he would eventually see the wrong he had done, that
[02:18:13.380 --> 02:18:17.580]   he would turn back from the dark path he was being led down.
[02:18:17.580 --> 02:18:22.020]   At the perimeter of their camp, two guards with the eagle of tannabral upon their breastplate
[02:18:22.020 --> 02:18:24.380]   saluted her.
[02:18:24.380 --> 02:18:28.180]   Men always stood together in his forest, never alone.
[02:18:28.180 --> 02:18:32.340]   The creatures of form were better defended against that way.
[02:18:32.340 --> 02:18:36.260]   Fidele stood and stared out into the shadows of the forest.
[02:18:36.260 --> 02:18:41.340]   We must leave, a voice said beside her, making her jump.
[02:18:41.340 --> 02:18:46.780]   Albin, the white haired healer, had followed her, his footsteps little more than a whisper
[02:18:46.780 --> 02:18:49.380]   upon the forest floor.
[02:18:49.380 --> 02:18:53.860]   A bandage was wrapped around the wound between his shoulder and chest that the traitorous
[02:18:53.860 --> 02:18:58.420]   Ector had given in the dungeons beneath Brickhan.
[02:18:58.420 --> 02:19:04.480]   Quiet, shy Ector, rather to crellis and veridis, more accustomed to holding a scroll than a
[02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:05.480]   sword.
[02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:13.220]   And yet, he had betrayed them and slain one of her most trusted companions, Peritus.
[02:19:13.220 --> 02:19:16.780]   It had been little more than a ten night ago and her grief was still fresh, but Albin
[02:19:16.780 --> 02:19:19.740]   seemed to have recovered well.
[02:19:19.740 --> 02:19:26.460]   He is a remarkable man, and a mysterious one, a warrior, and a healer, both but so much
[02:19:26.460 --> 02:19:31.060]   more than that, friend to Mykal, part of a secret group that has been waiting for these
[02:19:31.060 --> 02:19:32.060]   days preparing.
[02:19:32.060 --> 02:19:37.740]   "We must leave," Albin repeated, "time is against us."
[02:19:37.740 --> 02:19:43.900]   "No," she replied, an automatic response.
[02:19:43.900 --> 02:19:46.420]   She drew in a long breath composing herself.
[02:19:46.420 --> 02:19:52.180]   "This warband will not just march away from crellis, they are men of Ripper.
[02:19:52.180 --> 02:19:56.300]   "They'll do what you order them to do," Albin said quietly.
[02:19:56.300 --> 02:19:57.760]   "You are their queen."
[02:19:57.760 --> 02:20:01.700]   "I don't want to be queen.
[02:20:01.700 --> 02:20:04.620]   So many years I put duty first."
[02:20:04.620 --> 02:20:08.700]   She looked at Albin, saw him studying her face.
[02:20:08.700 --> 02:20:11.340]   He knows why I do not wish to leave.
[02:20:11.340 --> 02:20:15.860]   "I'll not leave without Mequin."
[02:20:15.860 --> 02:20:22.340]   Her warrior's face filled her mind, beaten and scarred, proud, fierce.
[02:20:22.340 --> 02:20:26.580]   She felt her spirits lift at the thought of him, remembered sitting at his side in the
[02:20:26.580 --> 02:20:33.180]   tower at Ripper, when he had opened his eyes after lying on the brink of death for so long.
[02:20:33.180 --> 02:20:36.900]   He had told her that he had stood upon the bridge of swords that one of the Ben Elium
[02:20:36.900 --> 02:20:38.700]   had given him a choice.
[02:20:38.700 --> 02:20:42.820]   "To cross over, or go back," he told her.
[02:20:42.820 --> 02:20:46.740]   "Why did you come back then?" she'd asked him.
[02:20:46.740 --> 02:20:48.460]   "Three reasons.
[02:20:48.460 --> 02:20:49.460]   Three people."
[02:20:49.460 --> 02:20:54.060]   "Jail, like us, you."
[02:20:54.060 --> 02:21:01.740]   He had paused and looked up into her eyes, two for vengeance, one for love.
[02:21:01.740 --> 02:21:06.100]   Her lips twitched in a smile at the memory of it.
[02:21:06.100 --> 02:21:08.740]   Albin's eyes creased with worrying, perhaps compassion.
[02:21:08.740 --> 02:21:13.580]   "You'll lose this war for one man?"
[02:21:13.580 --> 02:21:17.260]   So many answers flashed through her mind, most of them convincing in their own right,
[02:21:17.260 --> 02:21:19.420]   but she knew they were not the truth.
[02:21:19.420 --> 02:21:23.580]   "It will not come to that," she snapped.
[02:21:23.580 --> 02:21:24.580]   Albin frowned.
[02:21:24.580 --> 02:21:29.140]   "You cannot choose one man over a nation," he said.
[02:21:29.140 --> 02:21:32.660]   "More than that, her whole of the banish lands.
[02:21:32.660 --> 02:21:34.420]   We are in the god war.
[02:21:34.420 --> 02:21:36.860]   We cannot just walk away from this.
[02:21:36.860 --> 02:21:41.380]   It will consume the banish lands, and when it is done, those who stand against us wrath
[02:21:41.380 --> 02:21:44.820]   will either be victorious or they will be dead.
[02:21:44.820 --> 02:21:46.600]   There is nothing in between.
[02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:48.540]   It is war.
[02:21:48.540 --> 02:21:49.540]   Sacrifices must be made."
[02:21:49.540 --> 02:21:56.940]   "I am familiar with sacrifice," she said coldly, "but I'll not be a pawn to an absent
[02:21:56.940 --> 02:21:57.940]   god.
[02:21:57.940 --> 02:22:01.940]   I'll fight for my freedom, for my people, and follow my conscience.
[02:22:01.940 --> 02:22:06.420]   Yes, I fear for my keen, and I long for his return, but more than that, this warband
[02:22:06.420 --> 02:22:13.460]   is stronger with him and with Krelis, and Verides if they manage to find him.
[02:22:13.460 --> 02:22:15.380]   We must give them more time."
[02:22:15.380 --> 02:22:25.020]   "They may never return," my lady, Albin said quietly, voicing her deepest fear.
[02:22:25.020 --> 02:22:27.660]   Doubt and worry norded her.
[02:22:27.660 --> 02:22:32.660]   She remembered standing on the riverbank beyond Bricken's tower as the warband escaped deeper
[02:22:32.660 --> 02:22:37.900]   into the forest, camouflaged amongst Nefair's warriors.
[02:22:37.900 --> 02:22:42.700]   Maken, Albin, and Krelis had stood with her, looking back at the tower thinking of Verides
[02:22:42.700 --> 02:22:49.000]   and what he had vowed to do, to slay Caledus, one of the Caledashim.
[02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:52.820]   They had all seen the explosion of fire light up the tower window, and moments later seen
[02:22:52.820 --> 02:22:56.860]   the forms leaked from it, hurtling into the river.
[02:22:56.860 --> 02:23:00.380]   It was Verides, they were sure.
[02:23:00.380 --> 02:23:06.020]   Maken and Krelis had made to rush after him then and there, but Albin had stayed them
[02:23:06.020 --> 02:23:11.380]   a while, calling out names and gathering a score of men to go with them.
[02:23:11.380 --> 02:23:14.220]   Maken had crushed her and had tied to embrace.
[02:23:14.220 --> 02:23:17.060]   "Stay," she had whispered in his ear.
[02:23:17.060 --> 02:23:23.220]   "The Verides is my friend," Maken had replied, and he freed us.
[02:23:23.220 --> 02:23:29.420]   She'd held his gaze a long heartfelt moment and then he was gone, running into the night.
[02:23:29.420 --> 02:23:31.500]   Was that our last moment together?
[02:23:31.500 --> 02:23:38.540]   "My lady," one of the guards closed by said, pointing into the darkness of foreign forest.
[02:23:38.540 --> 02:23:39.540]   Someone approaches.
[02:23:39.540 --> 02:23:45.420]   Fidelis stared into the shadows, Albin tense beside her, a fist clamped around the hilt
[02:23:45.420 --> 02:23:47.420]   of his sword.
[02:23:47.420 --> 02:23:52.060]   One of the guards had raised a horn to his lips, ready to sound the call to arms.
[02:23:52.060 --> 02:23:59.580]   A figure separated from the gloom, dark silhouettes, six, seven, then one more, looming behind
[02:23:59.580 --> 02:24:04.220]   the others, dwarfing them, a giant.
[02:24:04.220 --> 02:24:08.380]   Swords were scraping from scabbards, then Fidelé recognized the first figure as it passed through
[02:24:08.380 --> 02:24:11.140]   a beam of daylight.
[02:24:11.140 --> 02:24:16.420]   Albin reached a hand out to the guard with a horn to his lips and pulled the horn away.
[02:24:16.420 --> 02:24:20.220]   One of the scouts whom Albin since watched the road.
[02:24:20.220 --> 02:24:24.380]   He was leading a group through the forest towards their camp.
[02:24:24.380 --> 02:24:30.700]   She felt her pulse quicken as her eyes scanned the shapes behind him, and then she was running,
[02:24:30.700 --> 02:24:35.340]   pushing past the guard's ferns and branches whipping at her face.
[02:24:35.340 --> 02:24:40.380]   Another figure was moving ahead of the scout running towards her, a loping stride, all controlled
[02:24:40.380 --> 02:24:43.180]   strength and grace.
[02:24:43.180 --> 02:24:45.340]   Maken.
[02:24:45.340 --> 02:24:50.820]   He opened his stride and ran ahead of the others, meeting Fidelé between two great oaks.
[02:24:50.820 --> 02:24:56.020]   They fell into each other, Maken's arms gripping her around the waist and crushing her against
[02:24:56.020 --> 02:24:57.020]   him.
[02:24:57.020 --> 02:25:03.220]   Her lips found his, and the next few moments were lost to the scent and taste of him.
[02:25:03.220 --> 02:25:07.980]   Eventually, she heard the others approaching and stepped back, hands still holding his,
[02:25:07.980 --> 02:25:09.700]   and looked at him.
[02:25:09.700 --> 02:25:15.260]   He was sweat-stained, hair pressed dark against his head, and he was smiling at her.
[02:25:15.260 --> 02:25:21.140]   Softening the hard lines and scars upon his face, he reached out and brushed a strand of
[02:25:21.140 --> 02:25:23.300]   hair from her cheek.
[02:25:23.300 --> 02:25:30.740]   "Now, that's a greeting worth fighting demons from the other world for," he said, "even
[02:25:30.740 --> 02:25:34.820]   if it is most unqueenly behaviour."
[02:25:34.820 --> 02:25:38.060]   A glance acknowledged the eyes gathering upon them.
[02:25:38.060 --> 02:25:45.180]   "I am more than just a queen," Fidelé said with a shrug, "and besides, in these times
[02:25:45.180 --> 02:25:49.480]   her, death feels never more than a few steps behind us.
[02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:55.300]   While I still draw breath, I'll live my life as I choose."
[02:25:55.300 --> 02:26:00.180]   Her eyes drifted to his bare arm, a jagged wound hastily stitched.
[02:26:00.180 --> 02:26:03.340]   It looked more like an animal bite than the product of a weapon.
[02:26:03.340 --> 02:26:06.820]   The edges were torn and bloodied.
[02:26:06.820 --> 02:26:13.100]   He saw her gaze upon the injury and shrugged riley, "Can you never come back to me without
[02:26:13.100 --> 02:26:15.580]   a fresh wound?"
[02:26:15.580 --> 02:26:17.780]   It's a bad habit, I must confess.
[02:26:17.780 --> 02:26:19.860]   He smiled at her.
[02:26:19.860 --> 02:26:24.620]   The others gathered about them now, and Fidelé saw Krelis standing with Varides, the bulk
[02:26:24.620 --> 02:26:27.500]   of Elsie on the giant behind them.
[02:26:27.500 --> 02:26:31.880]   They were both blood-stained and sweating, exhausted, but both of them were grinning at
[02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:35.900]   Albin as the old warrior hugged them both.
[02:26:35.900 --> 02:26:39.740]   There was a crashing behind her, and they all turned to see rain of a giant's ass and
[02:26:39.740 --> 02:26:43.500]   her bear, plowing through the undergrowth towards them.
[02:26:43.500 --> 02:26:47.660]   Alcyon pushed past Krelis and Varides, sending them flying, and met his family with an inhuman
[02:26:47.660 --> 02:26:52.980]   howl, their arms wrapping around one another, holding, squeezing as if they were becoming
[02:26:52.980 --> 02:26:53.980]   one.
[02:26:53.980 --> 02:26:59.780]   Slowly, they sank to their knees, still entwined, a shuddering sound pulsating from them.
[02:26:59.780 --> 02:27:01.980]   Alcyon's sobs.
[02:27:01.980 --> 02:27:06.940]   He held their faces, smothered them both with kisses, wife and son, and their tears and
[02:27:06.940 --> 02:27:10.180]   smiles mingled with his.
[02:27:10.180 --> 02:27:14.540]   In such dark times as these, it was heart-warming to see such love.
[02:27:14.540 --> 02:27:20.780]   She gripped Mackin's hand more tightly in her own, if only such happiness could last.
[02:27:20.780 --> 02:27:23.700]   "So, what now?"
[02:27:23.700 --> 02:27:25.500]   Krelis asked them.
[02:27:25.500 --> 02:27:29.220]   The small gathering were sitting around the burned out remains of a fire pit in the centre
[02:27:29.220 --> 02:27:30.220]   of their camp.
[02:27:30.220 --> 02:27:34.020]   "We must go to Dressel," Albin said.
[02:27:34.020 --> 02:27:37.740]   "Just where?" Krelis asked, looking around at them all.
[02:27:37.740 --> 02:27:44.580]   "I'm not one to walk away from my fights, but I've just lost nineteen men to—"
[02:27:44.580 --> 02:27:46.340]   his voice trailed off.
[02:27:46.340 --> 02:27:51.460]   "To demons of the other world," Varides said, "to the caddishim."
[02:27:51.460 --> 02:27:57.460]   "Still can't quite believe it," Krelis muttered, wiping a hand across his eyes.
[02:27:57.460 --> 02:28:02.820]   "I'm not one for fairy tales," he said, "but I know what I saw.
[02:28:02.820 --> 02:28:09.260]   My blade in an enemy's heart, and the bloody creature just smiled at me."
[02:28:09.260 --> 02:28:13.340]   I had to take his head to stop him from trying to rip my throat out.
[02:28:13.340 --> 02:28:18.740]   I saw winged things of mist and shadow forming above the headless corpses.
[02:28:18.740 --> 02:28:19.740]   He shook his head.
[02:28:19.740 --> 02:28:24.740]   "If we go to Dressel, it sounds as if we'll fess an army of these things.
[02:28:24.740 --> 02:28:30.220]   My men are warriors, bred for battle, brave and true-hearted.
[02:28:30.220 --> 02:28:38.360]   But they are only men of flesh and blood, so I must ask this question."
[02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:39.820]   His gaze returned to Albin.
[02:28:39.820 --> 02:28:43.220]   "Is this our fights?"
[02:28:43.220 --> 02:28:51.380]   "Slowly," Albin nodded, "it is," he said, "this is the God-war, Krelis.
[02:28:51.380 --> 02:28:57.580]   My Cal and the bright star are there, so Dressel must be where it will be decided."
[02:28:57.580 --> 02:29:04.340]   The battle is most likely already over, Krelis said, and the fair and his allies of at least
[02:29:04.340 --> 02:29:07.020]   the ten nights march on us.
[02:29:07.020 --> 02:29:10.740]   "If we do not go, who else will?"
[02:29:10.740 --> 02:29:13.580]   Albin said, "it is our duty to go."
[02:29:13.580 --> 02:29:20.580]   "My duty is to my men," Krelis said, waving a hand at the wallband about them, and to
[02:29:20.580 --> 02:29:24.540]   the people of Tenobral, "we are less than a thousand swords.
[02:29:24.540 --> 02:29:25.580]   We cannot win."
[02:29:25.580 --> 02:29:30.860]   A strategic man would withdraw, live to fight another day when the odds are more in our
[02:29:30.860 --> 02:29:31.860]   favour.
[02:29:31.860 --> 02:29:38.140]   "There will not be another day if we do not fight now," Albin said.
[02:29:38.140 --> 02:29:42.020]   "Calidus and the fair will destroy our allies one by one.
[02:29:42.020 --> 02:29:47.300]   We must stand with those who oppose them now before it is too late."
[02:29:47.300 --> 02:29:52.140]   And what if there's none of these allies left alive at Dressel by the time we get there?
[02:29:52.140 --> 02:29:56.940]   "We won't know unless we go there," Albin replied.
[02:29:56.940 --> 02:30:02.180]   A silent lengthened, all looking between Krelis and Albin.
[02:30:02.180 --> 02:30:08.140]   "Well, maybe you're right," Krelis eventually said, nodding thoughtfully.
[02:30:08.140 --> 02:30:15.380]   "I've always come to you when it's wisdom I've been looking for, but what if you're
[02:30:15.380 --> 02:30:21.860]   not?" Marching deep into the heart of Faun into unknown ground against a foe that out
[02:30:21.860 --> 02:30:23.420]   numbers us greatly.
[02:30:23.420 --> 02:30:25.980]   That's not wisdom.
[02:30:25.980 --> 02:30:31.620]   Not when we could retreat and choose our own ground, but still, this is a fight we must
[02:30:31.620 --> 02:30:33.220]   all agree to.
[02:30:33.220 --> 02:30:36.140]   "Say it to all of you.
[02:30:36.140 --> 02:30:41.580]   Ask you all, as my brothers in arms, are you for this fight here?
[02:30:41.580 --> 02:30:46.520]   Now, are you for Dressel, or are you for Horm?"
[02:30:46.520 --> 02:30:48.940]   "Home," thought Fidele.
[02:30:48.940 --> 02:30:55.020]   Part of me longs to find a place of peace with Makin, where this war cannot touch us.
[02:30:55.020 --> 02:30:58.820]   But is there a place far enough from this war to escape it?
[02:30:58.820 --> 02:31:04.420]   And even if there were, I would not abandon the people of Tenebral to death and torment.
[02:31:04.420 --> 02:31:06.620]   And then there is an affair.
[02:31:06.620 --> 02:31:08.780]   But ever he has done, he is still my son.
[02:31:08.780 --> 02:31:10.740]   I cannot just leave him.
[02:31:10.740 --> 02:31:16.580]   Well, credit said, dragging Fidele from her thoughts.
[02:31:16.580 --> 02:31:19.500]   We are friends here, equals.
[02:31:19.500 --> 02:31:22.420]   We have not been ordered by our Lord or King.
[02:31:22.420 --> 02:31:24.020]   We are free to choose.
[02:31:24.020 --> 02:31:26.940]   Let us put it to the votes.
[02:31:26.940 --> 02:31:31.100]   As for me, I say we leave this forest behind us.
[02:31:31.100 --> 02:31:34.180]   Back to Tenebral to raise more swords and choose our battleground.
[02:31:34.180 --> 02:31:39.100]   "I am for Dressel," Albin said.
[02:31:39.100 --> 02:31:44.740]   If Hidele looked around the fire pit, saw all lost in their own deliberations.
[02:31:44.740 --> 02:31:50.260]   I would go to Dressel, she thought, to save my son and for vengeance upon Lycus.
[02:31:50.260 --> 02:31:52.340]   But Krelis speaks wisdom.
[02:31:52.340 --> 02:31:55.500]   "What of you, little brother?"
[02:31:55.500 --> 02:31:56.500]   Krelis asked.
[02:31:56.500 --> 02:32:01.340]   "Are you for the great tree, or for Horm on the bay?"
[02:32:01.340 --> 02:32:05.740]   Veritas finally raised his head and regarded them all with his dark, serious eyes.
[02:32:05.740 --> 02:32:13.220]   "I've been a fool, been deceived, and committed dark deeds in the name of good."
[02:32:13.220 --> 02:32:17.820]   His face twisted with a bit of grimace as he looked at his open palms.
[02:32:17.820 --> 02:32:21.140]   Much blood, those hands, was spilled, but carried us.
[02:32:21.140 --> 02:32:28.140]   "I would do what I can to put that right," Veritas continued, "but how?" he mused.
[02:32:28.140 --> 02:32:30.300]   "My heart says Dressel.
[02:32:30.300 --> 02:32:31.300]   My head says home."
[02:32:31.300 --> 02:32:33.380]   "Krelis is right.
[02:32:33.380 --> 02:32:35.900]   We do not know what awaits us at Dressel, though.
[02:32:35.900 --> 02:32:37.860]   I do know this."
[02:32:37.860 --> 02:32:43.960]   Krelis has charged jail of Isilthir, Gondal, of Carnotan, and Lothar of Helvet to build
[02:32:43.960 --> 02:32:48.980]   roads to Dressel, and with them they bring the full might of their realms.
[02:32:48.980 --> 02:32:53.540]   "If we managed to make the long journey through Fawn, we would face impossible odds at the
[02:32:53.540 --> 02:32:54.540]   end of it."
[02:32:54.540 --> 02:33:00.100]   "Not if my Carl and the Bright Star still stand," Albin said.
[02:33:00.100 --> 02:33:06.700]   "And if they have fallen," Krelis said, "you are advising us to do the opposite of all
[02:33:06.700 --> 02:33:14.540]   you of torts, nor your enemy, choose your ground, that's what you've always told me."
[02:33:14.540 --> 02:33:21.620]   Krelis shook his head, "I know," Albin admitted, "what of you?" Krelis asked, shifting his
[02:33:21.620 --> 02:33:24.660]   gaze to Alcyon and the Giants.
[02:33:24.660 --> 02:33:28.700]   Rainer was cutting Alcyon's hair with her knife, leaving the top long and thick, the
[02:33:28.700 --> 02:33:30.700]   sides shaped to the skin.
[02:33:30.700 --> 02:33:33.380]   "What is she doing to him?
[02:33:33.380 --> 02:33:35.340]   He looks more fearsome than ever before."
[02:33:35.340 --> 02:33:41.300]   "We will travel with you, whichever way you go.
[02:33:41.300 --> 02:33:44.420]   If you will have us," Alcyon said.
[02:33:44.420 --> 02:33:47.660]   "And why would you wish to join us?"
[02:33:47.660 --> 02:33:49.740]   Krelis asked, "I is narrowing.
[02:33:49.740 --> 02:33:53.500]   Why not just leave now and go back to your clan?"
[02:33:53.500 --> 02:33:58.460]   "Two reasons," Alcyon said, his voice like gravel.
[02:33:58.460 --> 02:34:03.380]   "A blood debt," he glanced at verities, "and a blood feud."
[02:34:03.380 --> 02:34:09.780]   As he said the last, his fists clenched, knuckles popping.
[02:34:09.780 --> 02:34:15.780]   "Calidas made me a slave, kept my family prisoner.
[02:34:15.780 --> 02:34:21.580]   I would even, that score, fight him now, fight him later."
[02:34:21.580 --> 02:34:26.900]   Alcyon shrugged, "as long as I fight him, I cannot."
[02:34:26.900 --> 02:34:35.340]   "If you don't mind me asking," Krelis added to Alcyon, "buy the new hair cut."
[02:34:35.340 --> 02:34:39.140]   Alcyon rubbed the side of his head, stubble rasping on his palm, the hair on the top of
[02:34:39.140 --> 02:34:41.700]   his head a thick wedge.
[02:34:41.700 --> 02:34:45.340]   This is my clan's tradition.
[02:34:45.340 --> 02:34:51.900]   When Calidas caught me and bent me to his will, I was Kurgan no longer.
[02:34:51.900 --> 02:34:59.780]   I did not deserve the mark of my clan, but now I am Kurgan again."
[02:34:59.780 --> 02:35:07.700]   He smiled viciously, "Neither course is clear," Fidele said, "the wisdom suggests we retreat."
[02:35:07.700 --> 02:35:10.860]   "Are there any other options?"
[02:35:10.860 --> 02:35:15.580]   "We could fight now," Makin said.
[02:35:15.580 --> 02:35:17.660]   All eyes turned to him.
[02:35:17.660 --> 02:35:21.780]   The grizzled warrior looked at his hands, turning them over.
[02:35:21.780 --> 02:35:25.340]   Fidele beside him saw the calluses and scars.
[02:35:25.340 --> 02:35:30.340]   In the pit I have faced one foe, and I have faced many foes.
[02:35:30.340 --> 02:35:34.460]   It is always easier against one.
[02:35:34.460 --> 02:35:37.860]   I saw him fight four men and slay them all.
[02:35:37.860 --> 02:35:44.220]   Just many, I strike fast, before they have a chance to join against me, and I strike hard
[02:35:44.220 --> 02:35:46.940]   to kill with one blow.
[02:35:46.940 --> 02:35:56.980]   I, though this is no pit, this is fallen forest, and our enemies are not lining up before us,"
[02:35:56.980 --> 02:35:59.300]   Krelis growled.
[02:35:59.300 --> 02:36:06.300]   They will be if we allow them to, but one of them is close to us, cut off from the others
[02:36:06.300 --> 02:36:12.900]   gundle and the warband of Carnotan are out there close, building a road distracted, spread
[02:36:12.900 --> 02:36:15.660]   out with their backs to us.
[02:36:15.660 --> 02:36:20.700]   We'll likely fight him one day, though next time we see him, we'll probably be with half
[02:36:20.700 --> 02:36:24.860]   the realms of the banished lands at his back.
[02:36:24.860 --> 02:36:31.060]   Whether we go to Drassel or walk away, I say we have an opportunity here to even the odds
[02:36:31.060 --> 02:36:35.420]   a little, an opportunity would be fools to miss.
[02:36:35.420 --> 02:36:45.740]   Other sides, he added, "There's nothing like a good fight to clear their mind."
[02:36:45.740 --> 02:36:46.740]   Chapter Ten
[02:36:46.740 --> 02:36:47.740]   Jail
[02:36:47.740 --> 02:36:55.860]   Jail Stumbled and almost fell, swearing under his breath as he reached out to grab a thick
[02:36:55.860 --> 02:36:56.860]   branch.
[02:36:56.860 --> 02:37:03.740]   "I hate this forest," he studied himself, pausing to wipe sweat from his brow and catch
[02:37:03.740 --> 02:37:05.740]   a few breaths.
[02:37:05.740 --> 02:37:09.760]   His huntsman, Dag, was somewhere up ahead, setting a grueling pate as they marched through
[02:37:09.760 --> 02:37:10.960]   form forest.
[02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:18.280]   "How many nights have we lived in this twilight nightmare, twenty, thirty, a hundred?
[02:37:18.280 --> 02:37:20.820]   Will it ever end?"
[02:37:20.820 --> 02:37:25.020]   A line of warriors was strung before and behind him.
[02:37:25.020 --> 02:37:29.580]   A few hundred men, the only survivors of his warband are marked so proudly to the gates
[02:37:29.580 --> 02:37:31.380]   of Drassel.
[02:37:31.380 --> 02:37:37.700]   Thousand strong, the mite of Isilte are now broken, slain or scattered.
[02:37:37.700 --> 02:37:41.740]   And a third of those who fled with me have fallen since then to the forest and to its
[02:37:41.740 --> 02:37:43.540]   inhabitants.
[02:37:43.540 --> 02:37:47.980]   He shuddered at the memory of finding guards, gray and lifeless, their blood drained like
[02:37:47.980 --> 02:37:53.320]   geese from a ripe fruit, nothing much more left of them than skin and bone.
[02:37:53.320 --> 02:37:56.660]   "How did it come to this?"
[02:37:56.660 --> 02:37:59.100]   Victory was so close, Drassel almost mine.
[02:37:59.100 --> 02:38:03.140]   "How did that boy defeat Sumur?"
[02:38:03.140 --> 02:38:07.580]   He ground his teeth at the memory of Corbin, taking the Kalashim's head in single combat.
[02:38:07.580 --> 02:38:13.980]   It had been a blow, he could not deny, and it had done little for the morale of Jael's
[02:38:13.980 --> 02:38:15.380]   warband.
[02:38:15.380 --> 02:38:20.740]   So Jael had ordered his finest warriors, his personal guard, to swarm Corbin and slay
[02:38:20.740 --> 02:38:21.740]   him.
[02:38:21.740 --> 02:38:26.300]   Sure, victory had seemed mere heartbeats away, but then the gates of Drassel had opened,
[02:38:26.300 --> 02:38:31.080]   but Devil, Wolfen and the Stallion galloping out ahead of a host of giants and sword-waving
[02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:32.080]   lunatics.
[02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:36.860]   It had all gone downhill from there.
[02:38:36.860 --> 02:38:40.860]   That had been when Jael had made the decision to retreat.
[02:38:40.860 --> 02:38:43.020]   Retreat, not flee.
[02:38:43.020 --> 02:38:45.700]   A strategic withdrawal.
[02:38:45.700 --> 02:38:49.140]   Better to retreat and live to fight another day.
[02:38:49.140 --> 02:38:54.220]   And that is what I shall do here, retreat to Isiltea, raise a fresh warband, fight to
[02:38:54.220 --> 02:38:57.100]   hold onto what I have achieved.
[02:38:57.100 --> 02:39:00.580]   My lord," a voice said behind him.
[02:39:00.580 --> 02:39:03.900]   A sweat-soaked warrior was giving him a concerned frown.
[02:39:03.900 --> 02:39:04.900]   "What?"
[02:39:04.900 --> 02:39:07.380]   Jael snapped, irritably.
[02:39:07.380 --> 02:39:13.640]   "The line, my king," the warrior said, jerking his head forwards.
[02:39:13.640 --> 02:39:17.980]   Jael realized the warriors he'd been following were still moving, disappearing into the foliage
[02:39:17.980 --> 02:39:19.980]   and shadows.
[02:39:19.980 --> 02:39:23.980]   Fear jolted him into movement the thought of being stranded in the forest without dag
[02:39:23.980 --> 02:39:28.620]   to guide him was a horror he had no wish to endure.
[02:39:28.620 --> 02:39:33.300]   He hastened on, limbs heavy and leaden, catching up with the men ahead, then he was settling
[02:39:33.300 --> 02:39:39.260]   back into the monotonous march, his eyes fixed on the heels of the man in front of him.
[02:39:39.260 --> 02:39:43.180]   Whispering ahead caused Jael to look up from the ground.
[02:39:43.180 --> 02:39:47.500]   Dagg was moving back down the line, patting a shoulder here, pausing to say a few words
[02:39:47.500 --> 02:39:49.500]   there.
[02:39:49.500 --> 02:39:52.620]   Never thought of him as leader material.
[02:39:52.620 --> 02:39:58.100]   For some reason the thought irritated Jael, always seemed like a loner, and those scars
[02:39:58.100 --> 02:40:01.940]   on his face don't make him more pleasant to be around.
[02:40:01.940 --> 02:40:03.700]   The huntsmen eventually reached Jael.
[02:40:03.700 --> 02:40:09.900]   "You have news," Jael asked, ashamed of the desperation and hope that he tried to keep
[02:40:09.900 --> 02:40:11.900]   from his voice.
[02:40:11.900 --> 02:40:17.300]   "Aye," Dagg said, "there's men up ahead."
[02:40:17.300 --> 02:40:22.300]   Jael peered through dense undergrowth, for a moment struggling to understand what he was
[02:40:22.300 --> 02:40:23.300]   seeing.
[02:40:23.300 --> 02:40:27.540]   Only a dozen or so paces away, the undergrowth ended.
[02:40:27.540 --> 02:40:32.740]   A man made clearing dotted with cut tree stumps led towards an embankment.
[02:40:32.740 --> 02:40:37.060]   Men, hundreds of them, were swarming over the embankment which stretches far as he could
[02:40:37.060 --> 02:40:39.220]   see in both directions.
[02:40:39.220 --> 02:40:44.380]   They were working, many wielding, long handled axes and hammers were rising and falling,
[02:40:44.380 --> 02:40:48.380]   the rhythmic thud of their blows drumming through the forest.
[02:40:48.380 --> 02:40:49.940]   They're building a road.
[02:40:49.940 --> 02:40:55.460]   It must be loathar, or gundel, still building to reach Drassil and win the race that I had
[02:40:55.460 --> 02:40:57.620]   already won.
[02:40:57.620 --> 02:41:02.220]   Just looking at the industriousness of what could only be his allies, even if they were
[02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:08.020]   also rivals in Jael's mind, he began to feel something of his old confidence returning.
[02:41:08.020 --> 02:41:09.740]   I am safe.
[02:41:09.740 --> 02:41:13.740]   Safe from the forest, safe from pursuit.
[02:41:13.740 --> 02:41:19.500]   With me, he said to Dag, as he pushed his way through the undergrowth.
[02:41:19.500 --> 02:41:24.220]   He paused a moment, stood straighter and adjusted his tattered cloak, allowing his men to gather
[02:41:24.220 --> 02:41:28.940]   behind him, then marched across the clearing towards the embankment.
[02:41:28.940 --> 02:41:33.420]   The alarm was sounded when he was spotted, and warriors rapidly appeared clad in mail
[02:41:33.420 --> 02:41:37.300]   in brandishing swords and spears.
[02:41:37.300 --> 02:41:43.180]   Queerasses and banners bore the emblem of a burning torch upon a pale field.
[02:41:43.180 --> 02:41:45.100]   Gundel's warband, then.
[02:41:45.100 --> 02:41:46.100]   Excellent.
[02:41:46.100 --> 02:41:51.780]   He is far weaker than loathar, and much easier to manipulate.
[02:41:51.780 --> 02:41:55.180]   Jael strode to a warrior, standing amidst what was rapidly becoming a bristling head
[02:41:55.180 --> 02:42:00.060]   of sharp iron, already imagining that they were his warriors, his warband.
[02:42:00.060 --> 02:42:06.060]   "Take me to your king," Jael demanded imperiously.
[02:42:06.060 --> 02:42:10.980]   Jael paused for a moment on the road down which warriors of Karnatan were leading him.
[02:42:10.980 --> 02:42:14.740]   He'd walked a good half-league away from the forefront of this new road, built upon a fresh
[02:42:14.740 --> 02:42:18.900]   piled embankment with the forest stripped back to either side.
[02:42:18.900 --> 02:42:23.020]   Wayne's were moving up and down the road, warriors lining it.
[02:42:23.020 --> 02:42:27.220]   Gundel's camp appeared, a sprawling mast to the south of the new road at its center,
[02:42:27.220 --> 02:42:29.620]   a huge tent upon a low hill.
[02:42:29.620 --> 02:42:32.940]   "A mini," he whispered to Dag.
[02:42:32.940 --> 02:42:35.380]   He strode a step behind him.
[02:42:35.380 --> 02:42:39.100]   The rest of his tattered warband had been left at the side of the road.
[02:42:39.100 --> 02:42:44.740]   "Three, four thousand swords," the huntsmen said with a shrug, "heart to tail with all
[02:42:44.740 --> 02:42:47.740]   the other hangers on."
[02:42:47.740 --> 02:42:52.500]   They weaved through the camp, a host of sounds and smells of sailing in Jael as he was guided
[02:42:52.500 --> 02:42:55.460]   through a maze of tents and cookfires.
[02:42:55.460 --> 02:43:01.300]   Cattle load from paddocks, the stink of human habitation wafting towards him.
[02:43:01.300 --> 02:43:05.860]   After being a refugee in this otherworldly and oppressive forest for so long, he felt
[02:43:05.860 --> 02:43:08.920]   almost overwhelmed by it.
[02:43:08.920 --> 02:43:14.420]   The tent, Jael had spied from the road rose up before him, larger than it had at first
[02:43:14.420 --> 02:43:16.620]   appeared.
[02:43:16.620 --> 02:43:21.380]   His escort of a few-score warriors led him purposefully towards it.
[02:43:21.380 --> 02:43:22.380]   Gundel.
[02:43:22.380 --> 02:43:27.940]   A circle of pale-skinned and black-eyed warriors stood guard about the tent, clothed in dark
[02:43:27.940 --> 02:43:32.580]   mail and leather, curved swords arching over their shoulders.
[02:43:32.580 --> 02:43:35.180]   Nathairs, Jael.
[02:43:35.180 --> 02:43:39.780]   A score of them had marched with his own warband with Sumor as their captain.
[02:43:39.780 --> 02:43:44.220]   He remembered Sumor as skill in battle, the fury of the others as they had charged into
[02:43:44.220 --> 02:43:46.020]   battle.
[02:43:46.020 --> 02:43:53.340]   And the winged things that poured from them like poison when they fell, his skin crawled.
[02:43:53.340 --> 02:43:57.860]   Whatever they are, they are not men, but whatever they are, they still died.
[02:43:57.860 --> 02:43:59.940]   Still failed me.
[02:43:59.940 --> 02:44:03.260]   So much for Nathairs' great warriors.
[02:44:03.260 --> 02:44:08.260]   He felt an irrational anger about that, even as he felt fear and revulsion crawling across
[02:44:08.260 --> 02:44:09.900]   his skin.
[02:44:09.900 --> 02:44:12.220]   He regarded the Jael before him suspiciously.
[02:44:12.220 --> 02:44:14.540]   "What are you?"
[02:44:14.540 --> 02:44:19.500]   "Respect them, don't fear them," he reminded himself.
[02:44:19.500 --> 02:44:24.540]   They die the same as the rest of us, Sumor fell to Corbin, and the rest no doubt during
[02:44:24.540 --> 02:44:27.900]   the battle before the gates of Drasil.
[02:44:27.900 --> 02:44:31.260]   A pair of warriors parted before Jael.
[02:44:31.260 --> 02:44:36.460]   One opened the tent flap and Jael entered, dags still a step behind.
[02:44:36.460 --> 02:44:41.260]   The tent was luxuriously furnished, thick furs carpeting the ground and gold-trimmed tapestries
[02:44:41.260 --> 02:44:43.660]   draping the walls.
[02:44:43.660 --> 02:44:48.940]   Perfumed candles burned, they're sent thick and heavy in the air.
[02:44:48.940 --> 02:44:53.940]   Gondor was sitting on a wide-backed chair, one leg draped across the chair's arm, women
[02:44:53.940 --> 02:44:59.260]   clad in diaphanous silk, feeding him from various platters.
[02:44:59.260 --> 02:45:03.660]   The handful of young men lounged about him, their hair and beard slick and shining with
[02:45:03.660 --> 02:45:09.020]   oil, all of them were immaculately dressed in velvet and soft skins.
[02:45:09.020 --> 02:45:13.700]   Look at them, fawning sycophants gathered about the pot of gold, not a single one of
[02:45:13.700 --> 02:45:17.260]   them looks like they've held a blade in battle.
[02:45:17.260 --> 02:45:19.460]   Jael suppressed a sneer.
[02:45:19.460 --> 02:45:25.180]   "Well met, Gondol," he said, as he strode forwards.
[02:45:25.180 --> 02:45:30.460]   Gondol studied him, a blank expression replaced slowly with recognition.
[02:45:30.460 --> 02:45:33.860]   He shifted in his chair but did not rise.
[02:45:33.860 --> 02:45:41.100]   "Well, if it isn't Jael, the Vizil tier," Gondol said, a flaccid smile spreading across
[02:45:41.100 --> 02:45:43.060]   his face.
[02:45:43.060 --> 02:45:47.980]   "King, of Isil tier," Jael silently corrected as he returned a forced smile.
[02:45:47.980 --> 02:45:55.420]   "I did not recognize you," Gondol said, taking a long moment to look Jael up and down.
[02:45:55.420 --> 02:45:58.260]   Jael was abruptly aware of his appearance.
[02:45:58.260 --> 02:46:02.660]   When he rode to the gates of Drassel, he had been dressed in his finest war gear, a coat
[02:46:02.660 --> 02:46:10.900]   of gleaming chainmail, sabled cloak trimmed with fur, breeches and boots of dough skin.
[02:46:10.900 --> 02:46:16.460]   Now his cloak was mud-crusted and in tatters, his chainmail smeared and rusting his face
[02:46:16.460 --> 02:46:19.700]   and arms grimy and scratched beyond counting.
[02:46:19.700 --> 02:46:24.780]   "What a wonderful surprise," Gondol said with a barely disguised smirk.
[02:46:24.780 --> 02:46:30.180]   "I had heard that you were lost, presumed dead after your defeat by the Ravel at Drassel.
[02:46:30.180 --> 02:46:32.460]   I rejoice that you live."
[02:46:32.460 --> 02:46:36.500]   "Then why do you look so disappointed?
[02:46:36.500 --> 02:46:40.740]   Already planning the annexation of my realm, I guess?"
[02:46:40.740 --> 02:46:44.460]   Nothing made Jael angrier than thought of someone else stealing the realm he had so recently
[02:46:44.460 --> 02:46:47.340]   stolen for himself.
[02:46:47.340 --> 02:46:50.140]   He suppressed the urge to wrap his fingers around Gondol's throat.
[02:46:50.140 --> 02:46:55.220]   "If he thinks he can take Isletir from me, I will make him eat his own intestines."
[02:46:55.220 --> 02:47:03.780]   "A sentiment I share, I can assure you," Jael said, strapping his smile upon his face.
[02:47:03.780 --> 02:47:09.540]   The enemy at Drassel used fel magic against us, alas, but ave hearts and strong arms
[02:47:09.540 --> 02:47:13.420]   were not enough against the dark powers of Azeroth's black sun.
[02:47:13.420 --> 02:47:19.860]   "Really?" Gondol said, a more genuine smile twitching his lips.
[02:47:19.860 --> 02:47:21.780]   He sat straighter in his chair.
[02:47:21.780 --> 02:47:25.540]   "Nathair had little trouble against their fel magic."
[02:47:25.540 --> 02:47:27.860]   "What do you mean?"
[02:47:27.860 --> 02:47:30.220]   Jael asked.
[02:47:30.220 --> 02:47:34.740]   King Nathair took Drassel over a ten night ago, the enemy are broken and scattered.
[02:47:34.740 --> 02:47:35.740]   "What?"
[02:47:35.740 --> 02:47:37.460]   "The war is over."
[02:47:37.460 --> 02:47:42.660]   "Well, from what I hear there is some resistance still, but little more than the death throes
[02:47:42.660 --> 02:47:47.100]   of a foe that has not realized it's already lost."
[02:47:47.100 --> 02:47:52.660]   The war over, and my own war-band defeated, I'd hoped for more time to return to Isletir
[02:47:52.660 --> 02:47:58.100]   and raise a new war-band fresh battles and win some glory before the war was ended.
[02:47:58.100 --> 02:47:59.100]   "But now?"
[02:47:59.100 --> 02:48:06.020]   "That is wonderful news," Jael said, speaking through a fixed grin, "I can see that your
[02:48:06.020 --> 02:48:08.060]   old building is going well.
[02:48:08.060 --> 02:48:09.980]   If I could ask one favor..."
[02:48:09.980 --> 02:48:12.580]   "What do you want?"
[02:48:12.580 --> 02:48:16.940]   Gondol asked, looking suddenly bored with a conversation.
[02:48:16.940 --> 02:48:21.140]   He thinks to be broken, a defeated rival of no consequence.
[02:48:21.140 --> 02:48:27.860]   Jael stopped his teeth from grinding, "Horses, for myself and my men, an escort back to Isletir."
[02:48:27.860 --> 02:48:30.020]   "Your men?"
[02:48:30.020 --> 02:48:36.780]   Gondol sniffed, looking disdainfully at Dagg who stood silently behind Jael.
[02:48:36.780 --> 02:48:42.540]   One of the young men gathered about Gondol sniggered, "Calm, get what you need, just
[02:48:42.540 --> 02:48:44.700]   remember the sycophants face."
[02:48:44.700 --> 02:48:51.340]   "Yes, King Gondol," Jael said, in his most comradly voice.
[02:48:51.340 --> 02:48:55.540]   "My war-band are currently resting after their exertions."
[02:48:55.540 --> 02:48:57.540]   "How many?"
[02:48:57.540 --> 02:49:05.900]   Gondol frowned, "around three hundred," Jael said, "I am not sure that counts as a war-band."
[02:49:05.900 --> 02:49:11.180]   Gondol smiled slyly, and Jael's fingers twitched, "But even so, three hundred horses, I doubt
[02:49:11.180 --> 02:49:12.980]   I can spare so many.
[02:49:12.980 --> 02:49:16.500]   All my resources are going into building this road, you understand.
[02:49:16.500 --> 02:49:21.100]   I will reach justle before Lothar."
[02:49:21.100 --> 02:49:22.820]   So the race is still on.
[02:49:22.820 --> 02:49:27.660]   "Perhaps we can help each other, then," Jael said.
[02:49:27.660 --> 02:49:31.020]   "How could you possibly help me?"
[02:49:31.020 --> 02:49:34.820]   Gondol sneered, looking pointedly at Jael's tattered appearance.
[02:49:34.820 --> 02:49:38.860]   Jael bid back a harsh response and stood straighter.
[02:49:38.860 --> 02:49:42.980]   "I am still the king of Isilter.
[02:49:42.980 --> 02:49:51.500]   I could bring fresh workers to build your old, two thousand at least, maybe more."
[02:49:51.500 --> 02:49:55.540]   Gondol smiled broadened, and he sat straight in his chair, waving away the servants offering
[02:49:55.540 --> 02:49:57.060]   him platters of food.
[02:49:57.060 --> 02:50:01.860]   "You shall have your horses," he said.
[02:50:01.860 --> 02:50:05.820]   Jael opened his mouth to speak, but paused, the faint sound of shouting was filtering
[02:50:05.820 --> 02:50:08.820]   through the tent's opening.
[02:50:08.820 --> 02:50:13.900]   Gondol heard it too, and held his hand up to a man who was trying to whisper in his ear.
[02:50:13.900 --> 02:50:19.180]   The noisiers rapidly grew louder, shouts turning to screens punctuated with the distinct sound
[02:50:19.180 --> 02:50:22.100]   of iron clashing.
[02:50:22.100 --> 02:50:26.460]   Jael glanced at Dag, who stood poised like an animal on the edge of flight, one hand upon
[02:50:26.460 --> 02:50:28.180]   the hilt of his dagger.
[02:50:28.180 --> 02:50:32.260]   "We need to leave," the huntsman hissed Jael.
[02:50:32.260 --> 02:50:34.260]   "What is that?"
[02:50:34.260 --> 02:50:38.740]   Gondol snapped, standing, fear and worry flickering across his features.
[02:50:38.740 --> 02:50:45.820]   "It is battle, something that I don't think you are fully acquainted with."
[02:50:45.820 --> 02:50:50.260]   Gondol stroked from the tent, his gaggle of followers tight behind him.
[02:50:50.260 --> 02:50:53.860]   Jael and Dag slipped out after them.
[02:50:53.860 --> 02:50:58.380]   Outside, Gondol was stood on the slope of the hill, staring with a look of confused disbelief
[02:50:58.380 --> 02:51:02.320]   towards the northern fringe of his camp.
[02:51:02.320 --> 02:51:06.740]   Warriors were pouring onto the road from its far side, cutting into the milling guards and
[02:51:06.740 --> 02:51:08.740]   workers.
[02:51:08.740 --> 02:51:13.900]   Jael saw resistance, sluggishly forming, warriors from Gondol's warband attempting to form a
[02:51:13.900 --> 02:51:18.300]   defensive line across the road, but before they could organise themselves they were locked
[02:51:18.300 --> 02:51:21.380]   in combat with their assailants.
[02:51:21.380 --> 02:51:25.900]   Within moments, the attackers had burst through the hastily formed resistance and was streaming
[02:51:25.900 --> 02:51:28.660]   down the embankment into the camp.
[02:51:28.660 --> 02:51:32.340]   "Astroth stones, what now?"
[02:51:32.340 --> 02:51:37.380]   The jihah on the hillside were drawing close about Gondol, black eyes staring.
[02:51:37.380 --> 02:51:40.700]   "We need to get out of here," Dag repeated.
[02:51:40.700 --> 02:51:42.900]   "What's going on?"
[02:51:42.900 --> 02:51:46.020]   Gondol cried, part temper, part hysteria.
[02:51:46.020 --> 02:51:51.340]   "It would appear you were right," Jael said, not able to keep the smirk.
[02:51:51.340 --> 02:51:56.280]   From his face at the sound of terror in Gondol's voice, even though he felt the coils of fear
[02:51:56.280 --> 02:51:59.100]   squirming in his own belly.
[02:51:59.100 --> 02:52:03.780]   The enemy that you said did not know they were beaten, they appeared to be attacking
[02:52:03.780 --> 02:52:07.820]   you.
[02:52:07.820 --> 02:52:09.980]   CHAPTER 11
[02:52:09.980 --> 02:52:13.460]   MACKINE
[02:52:13.460 --> 02:52:18.220]   MACKINE gazed through foliage at the sprawling camp, feeling his body tense and fingers twitch
[02:52:18.220 --> 02:52:23.060]   for his knife-hilt as he watched crellis's men appear on the road and engage Gondol's
[02:52:23.060 --> 02:52:25.060]   men.
[02:52:25.060 --> 02:52:29.020]   Crouch on the far south of the camp, he saw a few dozen enemy guards standing with their
[02:52:29.020 --> 02:52:34.620]   backs to him in an open space cleared between the camp and the tree-line.
[02:52:34.620 --> 02:52:37.580]   They looked unsure of what to do.
[02:52:37.580 --> 02:52:42.100]   The man beside Mckine gripped his sword and took a step forwards.
[02:52:42.100 --> 02:52:47.860]   "Wait," Mckine whispered, seizing the warrior's arm.
[02:52:47.860 --> 02:52:51.540]   Until crellis hits the camp.
[02:52:51.540 --> 02:52:56.340]   Mckine had been given the command of a hundred men and they were spread loosely around him,
[02:52:56.340 --> 02:52:59.060]   hidden in the shadows and foliage.
[02:52:59.060 --> 02:53:02.820]   Only one thing had he said to them before they'd moved into position.
[02:53:02.820 --> 02:53:07.740]   "When I go, keep with me."
[02:53:07.740 --> 02:53:12.060]   Their task was to attack from the south and sweep up through the camp, spreading as much
[02:53:12.060 --> 02:53:16.020]   mayhem and panic along the way as was possible.
[02:53:16.020 --> 02:53:18.820]   Mckine was unused to leading men.
[02:53:18.820 --> 02:53:22.860]   The Vinthalan fighting pits had honed his will to survive, teaching him that above all
[02:53:22.860 --> 02:53:25.300]   else, you fight for yourself.
[02:53:25.300 --> 02:53:28.300]   "But that is what Lycos wanted.
[02:53:28.300 --> 02:53:32.860]   To break me, to strip away my loyalties, to make me less than human.
[02:53:32.860 --> 02:53:35.820]   I will not be that man again."
[02:53:35.820 --> 02:53:40.380]   The main attack was to be led by crellis, his first objective to clear the new road of
[02:53:40.380 --> 02:53:42.140]   all resistance.
[02:53:42.140 --> 02:53:47.420]   It was there that their scouts had reported most of Gondal's warband were to be found.
[02:53:47.420 --> 02:53:53.700]   Once the road was clear, crellis was to assault the camp, which was a signal for the others.
[02:53:53.700 --> 02:53:58.420]   Mckine and Albon were leading smaller groups hidden to the west and south of the camp.
[02:53:58.420 --> 02:54:03.420]   The plan was to meet crellis and his force at the command tent, situated on a hill close
[02:54:03.420 --> 02:54:06.420]   to the camp centre.
[02:54:06.420 --> 02:54:10.980]   At the thought of it, Mckine's eyes drifted to the tent on the mound.
[02:54:10.980 --> 02:54:14.620]   Mckine were appearing from his entrance, standing and staring at the commotion that crellis
[02:54:14.620 --> 02:54:16.620]   was causing.
[02:54:16.620 --> 02:54:19.540]   Gondal, it must be.
[02:54:19.540 --> 02:54:23.700]   Two other men emerged from the tent, hanging back from the rest.
[02:54:23.700 --> 02:54:30.700]   One of them seemed familiar in the way he walked, his posture, a confidence.
[02:54:30.700 --> 02:54:34.980]   Then dark-clothed figures were appearing from around the hill, drawing tight about those
[02:54:34.980 --> 02:54:38.020]   who had emerged from the tent.
[02:54:38.020 --> 02:54:42.380]   And from this distance, there was something clearly different about them.
[02:54:42.380 --> 02:54:43.380]   Kalashim.
[02:54:43.380 --> 02:54:44.380]   Damn it.
[02:54:44.380 --> 02:54:49.940]   We're outnumbered as it is without those hells spawned to complicate things.
[02:54:49.940 --> 02:54:55.940]   He shrugged at himself, knew they were committed now, and there was no turning back.
[02:54:55.940 --> 02:55:00.100]   And this whole attack was my idea, so I'd best be getting to that tent and making sure
[02:55:00.100 --> 02:55:02.900]   we win this thing.
[02:55:02.900 --> 02:55:06.980]   He looked back to the road and saw crellis's warriors pouring down the embankment and into
[02:55:06.980 --> 02:55:08.580]   the camp.
[02:55:08.580 --> 02:55:10.180]   Good.
[02:55:10.180 --> 02:55:14.820]   With a battle cry, he exploded into motion, bursting from the treeline, drawing a knife
[02:55:14.820 --> 02:55:19.820]   in each hand as he sped towards the guard, spread between him and the camp.
[02:55:19.820 --> 02:55:23.780]   A few paces behind him, his hundred followed.
[02:55:23.780 --> 02:55:27.660]   He heard a distant roar from the west, knew that Albin and his warriors were doing the
[02:55:27.660 --> 02:55:29.660]   same.
[02:55:29.660 --> 02:55:34.500]   Mckine ducked a spear thrust and crashed into the man holding it, one of his knives punching
[02:55:34.500 --> 02:55:39.060]   through leather into flesh, ripping it free as his momentum carried him on, leaving the
[02:55:39.060 --> 02:55:42.880]   man on his knees, hands clutching at his belly.
[02:55:42.880 --> 02:55:48.060]   In moments, the guards along the camp's edge were either dead or fleeing, the sudden onslaught
[02:55:48.060 --> 02:55:51.220]   of Mckine and his warriors too much for them.
[02:55:51.220 --> 02:55:55.980]   Mckine gathered his warriors and charged into the camp, kicking at fires, smashing gates
[02:55:55.980 --> 02:56:01.780]   open, freeing cattle, hacking and slashing at anyone who got in their way.
[02:56:01.780 --> 02:56:07.340]   In heartbeats, flames were licking at tents and smoke was billowing, stampedeing cattle
[02:56:07.340 --> 02:56:12.140]   knocked men flying, the whole world seemed to dissolve into chaos.
[02:56:12.140 --> 02:56:16.820]   Mckine turned a corner and almost ran into a dozen warriors, the ensuing combat savage
[02:56:16.820 --> 02:56:21.460]   and short, Mckine's knives finding throats and arteries as he slipped through them like
[02:56:21.460 --> 02:56:27.020]   a violent wind, the men following him crashing upon those still standing.
[02:56:27.020 --> 02:56:32.100]   He sped through the camp, a knife dripping blood in each hand, leaving a trail of bodies
[02:56:32.100 --> 02:56:34.180]   in his wake.
[02:56:34.180 --> 02:56:39.180]   As he travelled deeper, any kind of resistance melted away, those he came across ran from
[02:56:39.180 --> 02:56:41.900]   him and he was happy to let them go.
[02:56:41.900 --> 02:56:48.340]   For the most part, they were not Gondal's warriors but merchants, smiths, tanners, cobblers,
[02:56:48.340 --> 02:56:50.780]   drovers, whores and bends.
[02:56:50.780 --> 02:56:56.500]   "I may be a killer, but I'll not slay the innocent."
[02:56:56.500 --> 02:57:01.060]   Soon the initial red mist of battle began to fade and a glance behind saw the black and
[02:57:01.060 --> 02:57:04.660]   silver of Ripper's warriors following him.
[02:57:04.660 --> 02:57:09.660]   Not used to leading men these days or being in a fight this big, "Mustn't forget they're
[02:57:09.660 --> 02:57:14.460]   with me, mustn't forget the plan."
[02:57:14.460 --> 02:57:19.140]   Pauseing, he gave his men a chance to gather behind him as he tried to get his bearings.
[02:57:19.140 --> 02:57:24.380]   The beams and the concussive clash of iron drifted down from the north.
[02:57:24.380 --> 02:57:28.460]   Krelis sounds closer, but let's get to that commandant.
[02:57:28.460 --> 02:57:35.620]   Gondal must die for this to succeed and to do that, we must carve a way through his caddishim.
[02:57:35.620 --> 02:57:40.300]   He reached up to his shoulder and felt the hilt of a short sword, one of a pair strapped
[02:57:40.300 --> 02:57:42.260]   across his back.
[02:57:42.260 --> 02:57:47.820]   Makin preferred using his knives, but taking heads from caddishim was sword work.
[02:57:47.820 --> 02:57:50.060]   He set off again.
[02:57:50.060 --> 02:57:54.500]   Close-packed tents suddenly gave way to an open space, cookfires spread about it, tents
[02:57:54.500 --> 02:57:57.260]   forming a loose circle.
[02:57:57.260 --> 02:57:59.220]   Weapons racks were rode along one edge.
[02:57:59.220 --> 02:58:05.420]   A mass of men were pulling spears from stands, strapping on helms, hefting shields.
[02:58:05.420 --> 02:58:10.140]   Makin skidded to a halt, realizing what he had stumbled upon.
[02:58:10.140 --> 02:58:13.780]   A barracks for the warriors of this warband.
[02:58:13.780 --> 02:58:16.660]   With a snarl, he ran at them.
[02:58:16.660 --> 02:58:21.260]   He hit a knot of men before they had any time to react, his knives tracing a red ruin across
[02:58:21.260 --> 02:58:23.260]   their bodies.
[02:58:23.260 --> 02:58:28.060]   In moments, he was through them and hurling himself at a new wall of men.
[02:58:28.060 --> 02:58:31.180]   Weapons thrusted him, but the battle rage was upon him.
[02:58:31.180 --> 02:58:35.620]   The world seeming to slow, and he twisted and flowed around every blow aimed at him,
[02:58:35.620 --> 02:58:41.780]   his knives licking out to slice throats, puncture groins, cut hamstrings.
[02:58:41.780 --> 02:58:47.420]   Jim Lee, he hurt the clash of arms behind him, knew his men were following.
[02:58:47.420 --> 02:58:54.820]   Faces appeared before him grim, fearful, shocked, all fell to his twin blades.
[02:58:54.820 --> 02:58:57.100]   His progress slowed.
[02:58:57.100 --> 02:59:03.500]   The men crammed together now, his ability to move and sway hindered by a crush of bodies.
[02:59:03.500 --> 02:59:07.820]   A quick glance showed his men behind him, fighting furiously, but they were outnumbered
[02:59:07.820 --> 02:59:11.300]   and the enemy was beginning to curl around their flanks.
[02:59:11.300 --> 02:59:16.860]   Their surprise and savagery had taken them so far, but had not broken their foe.
[02:59:16.860 --> 02:59:19.660]   Things are about to get messy.
[02:59:19.660 --> 02:59:23.980]   McCain stepped to the right, deflected a thrust aimed at the ribs of one of his men, slashed
[02:59:23.980 --> 02:59:28.580]   across the face of the attacker, kicked another in the knee, saw him buckle and stepped close
[02:59:28.580 --> 02:59:31.260]   to cut his throat.
[02:59:31.260 --> 02:59:36.900]   There was a great crash and a concussion that undulated through the hard pressed warriors.
[02:59:36.900 --> 02:59:40.540]   Someone else joining this party.
[02:59:40.540 --> 02:59:46.660]   McCain glimpsed a giant figure, Alcyon, wielding two woodsman's axes, as McCain was using
[02:59:46.660 --> 02:59:52.020]   his knives, carving away through the enemy like a sigh that harvests time.
[02:59:52.020 --> 02:59:56.580]   Heads and limbs flew through the air and great gouts of blood.
[02:59:56.580 --> 02:59:58.620]   Alburn's crew.
[02:59:58.620 --> 03:00:03.860]   McCain grinned and leapt at his enemy, knew strength powering his muscles.
[03:00:03.860 --> 03:00:07.820]   Within moments, Gondol's warriors were wavering, a ripple of doubt and fear spreading through
[03:00:07.820 --> 03:00:10.900]   them, and then they were fleeing.
[03:00:10.900 --> 03:00:14.860]   McCain buried a knife in a back, ripped it free and stood over the collapsing figure,
[03:00:14.860 --> 03:00:17.980]   gore covered and breathing heavily.
[03:00:17.980 --> 03:00:22.740]   He saw Alcyon decapitate one more fleeing warrior, his wife Reina and their suntane
[03:00:22.740 --> 03:00:26.340]   either side of him, Alburn's warriors spread about them.
[03:00:26.340 --> 03:00:33.020]   "Well met," a voice said, and McCain turned to see Alburn striding towards him.
[03:00:33.020 --> 03:00:38.060]   The old man was pale, and had blood seeping from the bandage around his shoulder.
[03:00:38.060 --> 03:00:39.620]   I told him to stay at our camp.
[03:00:39.620 --> 03:00:43.980]   He had been better off there, and I had been happier knowing someone of his skill was
[03:00:43.980 --> 03:00:46.460]   guarding Finnerley.
[03:00:46.460 --> 03:00:50.860]   He felt a wave of fear for her as he did every time that he was parted from her, but this
[03:00:50.860 --> 03:00:51.860]   was war.
[03:00:51.860 --> 03:00:55.980]   They both knew that she could not be here in the midst of this.
[03:00:55.980 --> 03:01:02.820]   "Well met," McCain replied, sheathing a knife and gripping the old man's arm.
[03:01:02.820 --> 03:01:09.140]   He left blood-stained fingerprints, "Think you might have just saved my skin."
[03:01:09.140 --> 03:01:13.620]   Alburn looked around at the bodies, piled about McCain and threw out the barrack ground.
[03:01:13.620 --> 03:01:16.900]   "I doubt that," he said.
[03:01:16.900 --> 03:01:21.020]   He glanced up through the rolling smoke at the hill that loomed not far away.
[03:01:21.020 --> 03:01:26.660]   "Gundell," McCain said, "I, let's go and find him."
[03:01:26.660 --> 03:01:28.900]   Both of their war-bands were about them now.
[03:01:28.900 --> 03:01:32.580]   "There's cattle shim on that hill," McCain said loudly.
[03:01:32.580 --> 03:01:35.180]   "They don't die easily, remember?
[03:01:35.180 --> 03:01:38.340]   You must take their heads!"
[03:01:38.340 --> 03:01:41.540]   Alburn and others nodded grimly.
[03:01:41.540 --> 03:01:45.420]   McCain grinned at them, then ran for the hill.
[03:01:45.420 --> 03:01:49.900]   Clouds of smoke billowed about him, parted for a moment, and he saw the hill, the huge
[03:01:49.900 --> 03:01:55.700]   and gaudy tent upon it strangely out of place in the somber gloom of fawn.
[03:01:55.700 --> 03:01:57.180]   McCain ran faster.
[03:01:57.180 --> 03:02:02.340]   The camp, a place of flame and shadow, the thud of his comrades' feet behind him, screams
[03:02:02.340 --> 03:02:05.500]   and battle cries swirling on the eddying smoke.
[03:02:05.500 --> 03:02:10.740]   Then the ground began to rise and he burst from the haze and tents, Alburn, Alcyon, and
[03:02:10.740 --> 03:02:14.340]   their men only a few paces behind him.
[03:02:14.340 --> 03:02:18.500]   Men were still on the hill, but they were retreating, at least three score of the can of shim that
[03:02:18.500 --> 03:02:22.500]   encircled them were herding them northeast towards the newest part of the road.
[03:02:22.500 --> 03:02:25.540]   They're fleeing, running for drasil.
[03:02:25.540 --> 03:02:29.580]   And further along the road there'll be more reinforcements, can't let them reach that
[03:02:29.580 --> 03:02:31.780]   road.
[03:02:31.780 --> 03:02:37.580]   McCain sheathed his knives and drew the two short swords as he ran.
[03:02:37.580 --> 03:02:40.740]   The space between them narrowed quickly.
[03:02:40.740 --> 03:02:45.100]   McCain and those with him were silent, no battle cries, only the drum of their feet and
[03:02:45.100 --> 03:02:48.340]   the jangle and creak of mail and leather.
[03:02:48.340 --> 03:02:54.260]   Now properly, gundel and the kaddishim were aware of them, gundel yelling orders.
[03:02:54.260 --> 03:02:58.500]   A score of the kaddishim peeled away from the group, curved swords being drawn from behind
[03:02:58.500 --> 03:03:00.700]   their backs.
[03:03:00.700 --> 03:03:05.900]   McCain fixed its black eyes on McCain and ran at him, a dark grin splitting its pallid
[03:03:05.900 --> 03:03:08.380]   face.
[03:03:08.380 --> 03:03:12.220]   McCain felt a fist of fear squirm in his belly, remembering their ferocity and other
[03:03:12.220 --> 03:03:15.660]   worldliness when he'd encountered them previously.
[03:03:15.660 --> 03:03:19.780]   He growled in anger at his own fear and ran faster.
[03:03:19.780 --> 03:03:24.540]   The first kaddishim almost took his head, it soared whistling of fingers width above him
[03:03:24.540 --> 03:03:29.420]   as he threw himself into a roll, coming to his feet behind the creature, his own strike
[03:03:29.420 --> 03:03:34.060]   at its neck blocked with blinding speed, his second blade slicing through the back of its
[03:03:34.060 --> 03:03:37.340]   leg as it spun to face him.
[03:03:37.340 --> 03:03:43.060]   McCain leapt away, the creature stumbling as he tried to follow, its hamstrings cut.
[03:03:43.060 --> 03:03:47.940]   Even so, it was unnaturally fast, lurching after him.
[03:03:47.940 --> 03:03:52.740]   It should be on the ground, not still trying to gut me.
[03:03:52.740 --> 03:03:57.660]   All around him, his warriors were locked in combat with a kaddishim, battle cries and
[03:03:57.660 --> 03:03:59.740]   death screams rang out.
[03:03:59.740 --> 03:04:05.500]   He glimpsed Albon take ahead, saw that terrible black vapor fill the air.
[03:04:05.500 --> 03:04:09.180]   His distraction nearly cost meck in his life as his attacker launched a combination of
[03:04:09.180 --> 03:04:11.340]   two handed blows at him.
[03:04:11.340 --> 03:04:15.740]   He parried two and slipped inside the third, instinctively punching a short sword into
[03:04:15.740 --> 03:04:17.500]   its belly.
[03:04:17.500 --> 03:04:23.340]   The kaddishim's mouth gaped wide, foul breath washing over him as its teeth snapped, trying
[03:04:23.340 --> 03:04:25.460]   to fasten on his throat.
[03:04:25.460 --> 03:04:30.200]   He headbutted it, pushed away, leaving one sword in its belly, his other blade whistling
[03:04:30.200 --> 03:04:35.260]   around to crunch into its collarbone, blood and bone spraying as he wrenched it free
[03:04:35.260 --> 03:04:40.180]   and hacked again, this time cutting deep into the creature's neck.
[03:04:40.180 --> 03:04:45.420]   He darted in, swerving away from its curved sword, chupping at its neck to finish the
[03:04:45.420 --> 03:04:46.740]   job.
[03:04:46.740 --> 03:04:51.580]   Somehow, the kaddishim's hand snaked out and caught his blade in its fist.
[03:04:51.580 --> 03:04:56.100]   A finger flew through the air but still, it held on as it tried to bring its own sword
[03:04:56.100 --> 03:04:58.540]   round to bear.
[03:04:58.540 --> 03:05:03.100]   McInne grabbed its sword wrist and for a few heart boots, they lurched together in an ungainly
[03:05:03.100 --> 03:05:04.820]   dance.
[03:05:04.820 --> 03:05:08.020]   Within seconds, McInne knew he could not win a contest of strength.
[03:05:08.020 --> 03:05:10.900]   The kaddishim's grip was unnaturally strong.
[03:05:10.900 --> 03:05:15.740]   Then, in the blink of an eye, its head was spinning through the air and Albon's face
[03:05:15.740 --> 03:05:17.980]   appeared before him.
[03:05:17.980 --> 03:05:22.820]   The kaddishim's body slumped, fists still gripped around McInne's sword blade, oily
[03:05:22.820 --> 03:05:27.100]   black smoke pouring from the open wound of its neck.
[03:05:27.100 --> 03:05:32.900]   A winged creature formed in the air above him and screamed wordless hatred at him, then
[03:05:32.900 --> 03:05:36.540]   the wind caught it and it was gone.
[03:05:36.540 --> 03:05:40.740]   McInne sagged, Albon's hand reaching out to steady him.
[03:05:40.740 --> 03:05:46.260]   "There's no getting used to that," McInne breathed as he yanked his sword's free of
[03:05:46.260 --> 03:05:49.060]   the creature's corpse.
[03:05:49.060 --> 03:05:54.620]   He looked around, saw more of the demon forms appearing in the air above them and then evaporating.
[03:05:54.620 --> 03:06:00.920]   At a glance, it seemed that most of those kaddishim that had attacked them had fallen,
[03:06:00.920 --> 03:06:06.700]   though many of McInne's and Albon's men were lying still and silent upon the ground.
[03:06:06.700 --> 03:06:12.900]   As McInne watched, Alcyon, Reina, and Tain dispatched the last kaddishim.
[03:06:12.900 --> 03:06:15.900]   "Gundal," McInne breathed.
[03:06:15.900 --> 03:06:20.700]   "Down there," Albon gestured.
[03:06:20.700 --> 03:06:25.140]   McInne saw the king of Carnotan disappearing amongst the tents, far more kaddishim still
[03:06:25.140 --> 03:06:28.180]   about him than McInne had hoped to see.
[03:06:28.180 --> 03:06:30.300]   Two men were moving with them.
[03:06:30.300 --> 03:06:33.460]   One of them paused as the others disappeared from view and looked back.
[03:06:33.460 --> 03:06:36.500]   For a moment, McInne's eyes locked with him.
[03:06:36.500 --> 03:06:40.300]   He staggered, felt as if he'd just been punched in the gut.
[03:06:40.300 --> 03:06:43.260]   "It cannot be."
[03:06:43.260 --> 03:06:49.020]   McInne's heart was suddenly pounding in his chest, a wave of shock spilling into fury.
[03:06:49.020 --> 03:06:53.740]   "Jael."
[03:06:53.740 --> 03:06:55.780]   Chapter 12
[03:06:55.780 --> 03:06:59.020]   Jael.
[03:06:59.020 --> 03:07:02.700]   Jael stood and stared at the warriors on the hill.
[03:07:02.700 --> 03:07:10.260]   One man had emerged ahead of the others, blood-soaked and battle-grim, a shortsword in each hand.
[03:07:10.260 --> 03:07:14.820]   He was staring back at Jael, and although they were a good hundred paces apart, Jael was
[03:07:14.820 --> 03:07:18.220]   certain he saw a hatred twist the man's features.
[03:07:18.220 --> 03:07:21.860]   "There is something familiar about him."
[03:07:21.860 --> 03:07:29.580]   "My lord," Dagg said, pulling at his sleeve, "we must keep moving."
[03:07:29.580 --> 03:07:34.820]   They were following the Jael that was shepherding Gundal and his retinue of lackeys to safety,
[03:07:34.820 --> 03:07:38.980]   hoping that the Jael would guard Jael and Dagg as well as the others as they passed through
[03:07:38.980 --> 03:07:41.420]   the camp.
[03:07:41.420 --> 03:07:45.380]   Jael had heard the sounds of battle from the hilltop and paused to watch the bloody work
[03:07:45.380 --> 03:07:49.500]   of the handful of Jihar warriors that had remained behind.
[03:07:49.500 --> 03:07:56.740]   They had fallen, but then it was a score against close to 200, and even so the Jihar had decimated
[03:07:56.740 --> 03:07:59.020]   their enemy.
[03:07:59.020 --> 03:08:05.180]   As Jael stared, he saw the man burst into motion running hard towards him screaming Jael's
[03:08:05.180 --> 03:08:06.180]   name.
[03:08:06.180 --> 03:08:08.260]   "He knows me."
[03:08:08.260 --> 03:08:10.020]   Jael took an involuntary step back.
[03:08:10.020 --> 03:08:12.900]   It doesn't seem to light me much, though.
[03:08:12.900 --> 03:08:13.900]   "Who?"
[03:08:13.900 --> 03:08:15.660]   Then he knew.
[03:08:15.660 --> 03:08:16.660]   "Makeen."
[03:08:16.660 --> 03:08:21.940]   He had changed almost beyond all recognition, slimmer than Jael remembered him.
[03:08:21.940 --> 03:08:28.620]   His body chiseled, arms and legs, a striated mass of muscle, face a place of ridges, scars,
[03:08:28.620 --> 03:08:31.900]   and hate-filled eyes.
[03:08:31.900 --> 03:08:34.300]   How is he here?
[03:08:34.300 --> 03:08:35.300]   He should be dead.
[03:08:35.300 --> 03:08:40.180]   Or at least a thousand leagues from here, and in shackles.
[03:08:40.180 --> 03:08:44.260]   Jael remembered the last time he had seen Makeen on the bridge at Dunkellen, chained
[03:08:44.260 --> 03:08:49.220]   and being dragged away by Lyca's to a Vin Fallon slave ship.
[03:08:49.220 --> 03:08:54.920]   The fool had challenged me to the court of swords, insulted me in front of my men.
[03:08:54.920 --> 03:09:00.300]   From the look on Makeen's face, that court of swords was still high on his agenda.
[03:09:00.300 --> 03:09:02.220]   Jael gulped.
[03:09:02.220 --> 03:09:06.220]   If Makeen's expression did not convince him that he was time to go, the warriors charging
[03:09:06.220 --> 03:09:09.240]   down the hill behind Makeen did.
[03:09:09.240 --> 03:09:12.240]   There were giants amongst him.
[03:09:12.240 --> 03:09:18.460]   This way, Dagg snapped at him as they entered a maze of tents, banks of thick smoke rolling
[03:09:18.460 --> 03:09:23.940]   through it, the shouts and screams of battle drifting and swirling all about them.
[03:09:23.940 --> 03:09:27.640]   Footsteps drummed on the turf of the hill somewhere behind him, and the jihar were nowhere
[03:09:27.640 --> 03:09:29.140]   to be seen.
[03:09:29.140 --> 03:09:38.240]   Tannock clenched a fist in his gut, "Jael!" a voice screamed behind him, "Keep running!"
[03:09:38.240 --> 03:09:44.180]   Then he saw Dagg, the huntsman moving fast, head dipped, scanning the ground.
[03:09:44.180 --> 03:09:48.940]   Jael followed him around a tent, ran down an empty aisle of churned, marred and barrels
[03:09:48.940 --> 03:09:53.500]   piled high, then turned again and saw the dark figures of the jihar hurrying ahead of
[03:09:53.500 --> 03:09:55.140]   them.
[03:09:55.140 --> 03:09:57.460]   Relief swept him, and he picked up his pace.
[03:09:57.460 --> 03:10:01.940]   He and Dagg steadily catching up with Gondal and his protectors.
[03:10:01.940 --> 03:10:06.340]   They were close to the jihar now, only a score of paces separating them.
[03:10:06.340 --> 03:10:10.100]   The final burst of speed and Jael was at their heels.
[03:10:10.100 --> 03:10:13.380]   He tried to shoulder his way between two of them and enter their protective circle, but
[03:10:13.380 --> 03:10:16.820]   one turned and fixed him with its black, dead eyes.
[03:10:16.820 --> 03:10:24.420]   "Let me through," Jael gasped, "I am Jael, king of Isoldir, you must protect me."
[03:10:24.420 --> 03:10:30.340]   The jihar warrior cocked its head at him, then it pushed Jael back, sending him stumbling.
[03:10:30.340 --> 03:10:32.340]   Dagg reached out and steadied him.
[03:10:32.340 --> 03:10:34.480]   "Shouldn't have left my men on the roadside.
[03:10:34.480 --> 03:10:38.780]   Need my men!"
[03:10:38.780 --> 03:10:39.780]   Jael breathed to Dagg.
[03:10:39.780 --> 03:10:46.380]   "The English louder go on that way," Dagg said, "save for the travel with them."
[03:10:46.380 --> 03:10:49.540]   "Aye," Jael muttered.
[03:10:49.540 --> 03:10:54.580]   He saw Dagg surreptitiously glanced and corridors made by rows of tents.
[03:10:54.580 --> 03:10:59.780]   He looks as if he's thinking of slinking off, but probably do the same if I was him.
[03:10:59.780 --> 03:11:05.340]   "Gold," Jael hacked out of his burning lungs, "I need this man."
[03:11:05.340 --> 03:11:06.340]   "What?"
[03:11:06.340 --> 03:11:12.380]   "Gold, for you, when you get me to McKill, more than you can carry, more than you've ever
[03:11:12.380 --> 03:11:13.380]   dreamed of."
[03:11:13.380 --> 03:11:17.620]   "I've dreamed of a lot of gold in my time," Dagg said.
[03:11:17.620 --> 03:11:20.660]   "You've earned it," Jael breathed.
[03:11:20.660 --> 03:11:23.900]   "Rick and I have," Dagg muttered.
[03:11:23.900 --> 03:11:26.740]   "A greedy smile crept across his face.
[03:11:26.740 --> 03:11:31.780]   "I'll get you to McKill," the huntsman said.
[03:11:31.780 --> 03:11:36.700]   The sounds of battle suddenly grew louder, and knots of enemy warriors clothed in black
[03:11:36.700 --> 03:11:38.660]   and silver appeared ahead of them.
[03:11:38.660 --> 03:11:41.900]   They looked like Nefair's colours.
[03:11:41.900 --> 03:11:45.780]   Jael drew his sword as a warrior lurched before him.
[03:11:45.780 --> 03:11:50.180]   One of Gondol's men, his sword wildly parrying a flurry of blows from a warrior in black
[03:11:50.180 --> 03:11:52.520]   and silver.
[03:11:52.520 --> 03:11:56.300]   Jael stabbed his sword into the attacker's side, ripping his sword free.
[03:11:56.300 --> 03:12:00.660]   He pushed the dying man away and leapt over him, eyes searching for Dagg, his heart pounding
[03:12:00.660 --> 03:12:02.540]   desperately when he could not see him.
[03:12:02.540 --> 03:12:06.540]   "This way," Dagg called to him.
[03:12:06.540 --> 03:12:09.180]   Something slammed into Jael's back.
[03:12:09.180 --> 03:12:13.340]   He flew through the air, weightless for a moment, then hit the ground, air crushed from
[03:12:13.340 --> 03:12:17.280]   his lungs, and he was sliding in the mud, rolling.
[03:12:17.280 --> 03:12:21.580]   He came to a stop and rose to one knee, trying to ignore the pain in his chest and shoulder,
[03:12:21.580 --> 03:12:25.740]   hand grasping for his sword-hilt, looking back to see a lunatic covered in blood rising
[03:12:25.740 --> 03:12:27.300]   from the ground.
[03:12:27.300 --> 03:12:28.300]   "Makeen!
[03:12:28.300 --> 03:12:29.300]   Run!"
[03:12:29.300 --> 03:12:32.780]   Jael's mind screamed at him, but he knew he would not make it.
[03:12:32.780 --> 03:12:35.580]   Makeen was too close for him to make a safe escape.
[03:12:35.580 --> 03:12:38.060]   Jael rose to his feet and hefted his sword.
[03:12:38.060 --> 03:12:41.740]   "I am the finest sword in Isilter.
[03:12:41.740 --> 03:12:46.540]   I slew Castellan single combat and he was a great swordsman in his prime, not old and
[03:12:46.540 --> 03:12:50.100]   half mad like this man before me."
[03:12:50.100 --> 03:12:53.780]   He set his feet and raised his blade.
[03:12:53.780 --> 03:12:55.860]   The world around him faded.
[03:12:55.860 --> 03:13:00.900]   The battle raging only a handful of strides away dimmed as a cold focus settled upon him,
[03:13:00.900 --> 03:13:03.660]   as it always did when he committed to the blade.
[03:13:03.660 --> 03:13:05.780]   "Come!" he shouted.
[03:13:05.780 --> 03:13:09.140]   "And I'll send you to meet Castell!"
[03:13:09.140 --> 03:13:15.740]   As he thought to anger Makeen, unbalanced him with rage, as angry men make mistakes.
[03:13:15.740 --> 03:13:19.140]   By the look on Makeen's face his tactic worked.
[03:13:19.140 --> 03:13:24.940]   The man gripped his second blade and launched himself forwards, faced twisted and snarled.
[03:13:24.940 --> 03:13:27.140]   He's moving too fast.
[03:13:27.140 --> 03:13:31.220]   The smile twitched at Jael's lips as he stepped forwards to meet Makeen, lunging as he did
[03:13:31.220 --> 03:13:35.020]   so, his sword tip aimed straight at Makeen's heart.
[03:13:35.020 --> 03:13:40.060]   His own speed will impale him the idiot, he's a dead man.
[03:13:40.060 --> 03:13:45.380]   But then, Jael was stabbing into empty air, Makeen no longer where he was supposed to
[03:13:45.380 --> 03:13:46.380]   be.
[03:13:46.380 --> 03:13:52.060]   A blow slammed into Jael's side, crunching into his ribs, white pain exploding in his
[03:13:52.060 --> 03:13:54.860]   chest as he dropped to one knee.
[03:13:54.860 --> 03:13:57.500]   The sudden urge to vomit almost consumed him.
[03:13:57.500 --> 03:14:01.500]   He's broken my ribs, he relighted in shock.
[03:14:01.500 --> 03:14:05.980]   His hand probing at his side, all the chainmail links bent and broken.
[03:14:05.980 --> 03:14:08.740]   Move or die.
[03:14:08.740 --> 03:14:13.620]   Jael heaved himself to his feet, raised his sword and pivoted on his heel, but the expected
[03:14:13.620 --> 03:14:15.380]   blow never came at him.
[03:14:15.380 --> 03:14:19.740]   Instead, Makeen was standing a few paces away just staring at him.
[03:14:19.740 --> 03:14:24.620]   "I've waited a long time for this," Makeen said.
[03:14:24.620 --> 03:14:31.980]   His voice as cold and hard as frosted iron, healing you quicks too good for you.
[03:14:31.980 --> 03:14:36.740]   A seed of fear blossomed in Jael's chest, the utter confidence in Makeen's eyes chilling
[03:14:36.740 --> 03:14:37.740]   him.
[03:14:37.740 --> 03:14:43.220]   "Don't be a fool, I've watched him train on the weapons court, I know his strengths,
[03:14:43.220 --> 03:14:49.420]   his weaknesses, he's old, slow, I know I can beat him."
[03:14:49.420 --> 03:14:56.700]   Bastell said something similar, "Just before I bled him, like a sow," Jael said, trying
[03:14:56.700 --> 03:15:00.300]   to keep the pain of his splinted ribs out of his voice.
[03:15:00.300 --> 03:15:03.580]   Makeen came at him, slowly this time.
[03:15:03.580 --> 03:15:07.980]   Jael noticed knife hilts protruding from half a dozen places on Makeen, two on his belt,
[03:15:07.980 --> 03:15:12.500]   a shoulder strap, a hilt poking from a boot.
[03:15:12.500 --> 03:15:15.980]   One of Makeen's short swords trailed a lazy circle as the battles guard warrior rolled
[03:15:15.980 --> 03:15:21.540]   a wrist, then almost faster than Jael could follow, Makeen was striking at him.
[03:15:21.540 --> 03:15:26.580]   Jael staggered backwards, pain from his ribs exploding with every breath and step as he
[03:15:26.580 --> 03:15:31.420]   blocked Makeen's blows, each parry more ragged than the last.
[03:15:31.420 --> 03:15:35.980]   He's as fast as the jihah, it's impossible, what's happened to him?
[03:15:35.980 --> 03:15:40.620]   Panic threatened Jael now, as a line of white fire ignited long one thigh when Makeen cut
[03:15:40.620 --> 03:15:45.460]   him, moving too fast for him to defend against, another wound appearing on his forearm, a
[03:15:45.460 --> 03:15:51.380]   slash across his forehead, sending him tumbling backwards as blood sheeted into his eyes.
[03:15:51.380 --> 03:15:55.580]   Jael lay on his back, an arm wiping the blood from his eyes.
[03:15:55.580 --> 03:16:00.780]   Looking up, he saw grey sky veiled by the trees of fawn and then Makeen appeared, looming
[03:16:00.780 --> 03:16:02.420]   over him.
[03:16:02.420 --> 03:16:07.740]   His face was latticed with scars, one ear mostly gone, just a lump of flesh remaining,
[03:16:07.740 --> 03:16:10.900]   his hair more grey than black.
[03:16:10.900 --> 03:16:15.780]   Jael searched the ground for the hilt of his sword, felt its worn leather and snatched
[03:16:15.780 --> 03:16:17.620]   at it.
[03:16:17.620 --> 03:16:22.100]   Makeen's boot crunched into his ribs as the old warrior kicked him.
[03:16:22.100 --> 03:16:26.180]   Jael screamed, rolled over, vomited bile into the mud.
[03:16:26.180 --> 03:16:33.620]   "When you see Castell, be sure and tell him I kept my oath," Makeen said above him.
[03:16:33.620 --> 03:16:37.620]   "This can't be happening, he's old!"
[03:16:37.620 --> 03:16:41.660]   Jael rolled onto his back, arms raised, wanting to beg for mercy but he couldn't seem to
[03:16:41.660 --> 03:16:43.980]   get his lungs to work properly.
[03:16:43.980 --> 03:16:47.620]   Only a blubbering wheeze came from his gaping mouth.
[03:16:47.620 --> 03:16:53.380]   Makeen raised one of his swords, then there was a crunch, and Makeen was gone.
[03:16:53.380 --> 03:16:57.060]   He turned his head and saw Makeen born to the ground, grappling with another figure,
[03:16:57.060 --> 03:16:58.940]   small and wiry.
[03:16:58.940 --> 03:17:02.300]   "Dag, I love that man!"
[03:17:02.300 --> 03:17:06.780]   Jael climbed to his knees, grabbed his sword, and leaving himself to his feet, a wave of
[03:17:06.780 --> 03:17:11.700]   dizziness and nausea, threatening him as his broken ribs complained.
[03:17:11.700 --> 03:17:14.060]   All around him, men were fighting.
[03:17:14.060 --> 03:17:17.980]   The Jihar seemingly reduced to a handful, and more men in black and silver, joining
[03:17:17.980 --> 03:17:18.980]   the battle.
[03:17:18.980 --> 03:17:25.740]   Gundal and his protectors were nowhere to be seen, I need to get out of here.
[03:17:25.740 --> 03:17:30.340]   Makeen and Dag were still fighting, Makeen's short swords lying in the mud, a knife glinting
[03:17:30.340 --> 03:17:32.780]   in Dag's fist.
[03:17:32.780 --> 03:17:38.980]   Jael stumbled towards them, raised his sword, waiting for a clear thrust at Makeen.
[03:17:38.980 --> 03:17:42.880]   A new battle cry rose up, this one deep and alien.
[03:17:42.880 --> 03:17:46.620]   The giant he had seen in Makeen's company had appeared from out of the smoke and chaos,
[03:17:46.620 --> 03:17:52.020]   two more giants behind him, as well as a knot of warriors in black and silver.
[03:17:52.020 --> 03:17:57.820]   The first giant saw him and bellowed, then charged at him, all those behind him following.
[03:17:57.820 --> 03:18:03.460]   And Jael felt the ground tremble, he glanced down at Dag Makeen, I need Makeen dead and
[03:18:03.460 --> 03:18:08.180]   Dag alive, he is going to get me back to Isiltir.
[03:18:08.180 --> 03:18:13.500]   Jael looked back up at the onrushing giant, and the swarm of sharp iron behind it.
[03:18:13.500 --> 03:18:19.940]   He turned and ran.
[03:18:19.940 --> 03:18:28.820]   After thirteen, Fidele, Fidele paced around the cold ash of the fire pit.
[03:18:28.820 --> 03:18:33.820]   In the distance, she could hear the screams of battle in the clash of iron.
[03:18:33.820 --> 03:18:38.700]   They say I am queen, that I must do my duty and lead the men of Tenobral, yet they leave
[03:18:38.700 --> 03:18:43.020]   me here with a score of men guarded like a prisoner.
[03:18:43.020 --> 03:18:47.420]   To keep me safe, how is this leading?
[03:18:47.420 --> 03:18:51.020]   He muttered a string of curses under her breath, some of the shield men left a guard
[03:18:51.020 --> 03:18:53.000]   at her, glanced at her.
[03:18:53.000 --> 03:18:55.860]   A smile twitched the mouth of one.
[03:18:55.860 --> 03:18:58.740]   I should not be here.
[03:18:58.740 --> 03:19:02.860]   When Makeen had suggested the attack on Gondol's camp, she had known instantly that it was
[03:19:02.860 --> 03:19:07.460]   the right thing to do and the thought of doing, of attacking instead of running, had its
[03:19:07.460 --> 03:19:09.820]   own heady appeal.
[03:19:09.820 --> 03:19:15.180]   Fidele had seen the others warm to the idea quickly, and had felt a jolt of pride in Makeen,
[03:19:15.180 --> 03:19:20.260]   being him listened to by the Lords of Ripper, not that it had surprised her.
[03:19:20.260 --> 03:19:24.580]   She'd recognized something rare in Makeen during their escape through Tenobral, intelligence
[03:19:24.580 --> 03:19:27.860]   and strength and a lack of ego.
[03:19:27.860 --> 03:19:31.780]   He had the ability to look at a situation and know what had to be done, and then to do
[03:19:31.780 --> 03:19:36.580]   it with absolute commitment or die in the trying.
[03:19:36.580 --> 03:19:41.580]   More screams echoed through the forest, the din of battle ebbing and flowing, and she
[03:19:41.580 --> 03:19:44.140]   ground her teeth in frustration.
[03:19:44.140 --> 03:19:49.980]   I will not be a bystander or a leader that does not lead.
[03:19:49.980 --> 03:19:54.260]   She brushed the knife hill to her belt and strode away from the cold fire pit towards
[03:19:54.260 --> 03:20:01.340]   a rack of weapons, gripped a slim shafted spear and hefted it, testing its weight.
[03:20:01.340 --> 03:20:05.780]   For a moment she was back in Tenobral, in the forest with Makeen fighting her fear as
[03:20:05.780 --> 03:20:09.700]   she plunged a spear into the throats of a Vinthalan warrior.
[03:20:09.700 --> 03:20:17.420]   "My lady," one of the warriors said, questioning me, "I am going to the battle," Fidelé said.
[03:20:17.420 --> 03:20:22.220]   "What is that, wise?"
[03:20:22.220 --> 03:20:27.380]   The warrior blinked, "My lady," he added.
[03:20:27.380 --> 03:20:31.620]   He was not young, by the look of him he was a veteran of battle, a scar running through
[03:20:31.620 --> 03:20:34.420]   the red and silver of his beard.
[03:20:34.420 --> 03:20:36.980]   But unused to talking to queens it appears.
[03:20:36.980 --> 03:20:39.100]   "What is your name?"
[03:20:39.100 --> 03:20:40.500]   She asked him.
[03:20:40.500 --> 03:20:48.020]   "Agost, my lady," he said, "well, agost, I am going to see how the battle fares."
[03:20:48.020 --> 03:20:56.140]   "But, Albon, is not my lord and does not command me," Fidelé finished for him.
[03:20:56.140 --> 03:20:59.220]   "My people are out there, fighting.
[03:20:59.220 --> 03:21:00.820]   My place is with them.
[03:21:00.820 --> 03:21:05.540]   I have seen war and dark deeds," she continued, louder for all to hear.
[03:21:05.540 --> 03:21:10.620]   "I am no stranger to blood, and right now the men of Tenobral are spilling theirs, are
[03:21:10.620 --> 03:21:13.860]   not stand hidden and await the outcome.
[03:21:13.860 --> 03:21:19.020]   Though we are few in number, we could still be needed at some hard-pressed moment, battles
[03:21:19.020 --> 03:21:22.580]   have turned on less."
[03:21:22.580 --> 03:21:26.960]   She looked around at their faces, saw the eagerness in their eyes, knew they did not
[03:21:26.960 --> 03:21:32.180]   want to be standing guard over her when their shield brothers were dying.
[03:21:32.180 --> 03:21:39.220]   With that, she gripped her spear like a staff and marched resolutely out of the camp.
[03:21:39.220 --> 03:21:43.980]   The sound of battle grew steadily louder as they moved through the forest, agost and
[03:21:43.980 --> 03:21:48.980]   a few others slipping in front of her, a protective hand.
[03:21:48.980 --> 03:21:52.540]   Agost paused, held his hand up, and they stopped.
[03:21:52.540 --> 03:21:54.340]   "What?"
[03:21:54.340 --> 03:21:56.460]   Fidelé whispered.
[03:21:56.460 --> 03:22:00.820]   "Someone's out there," Agost said, pointing deeper into the forest away from the sound
[03:22:00.820 --> 03:22:02.820]   of the battle.
[03:22:02.820 --> 03:22:07.860]   His signals and a handful of men followed him into the trees disappearing into the shadows.
[03:22:07.860 --> 03:22:13.820]   For a hundred heartbeats, Fidelé heard nothing, then, shouting, a clash of iron.
[03:22:13.820 --> 03:22:14.820]   Voices.
[03:22:14.820 --> 03:22:20.220]   "My lady," Agost's voice called, and Fidelé stepped through the trees, the remainder of
[03:22:20.220 --> 03:22:22.980]   her guard about her.
[03:22:22.980 --> 03:22:27.580]   Agost and his warriors stood with three men, all clothed in leather and fur, beards braided
[03:22:27.580 --> 03:22:30.340]   and bound with leather.
[03:22:30.340 --> 03:22:33.420]   Others hung at their belts, single-bladed and short-hafted.
[03:22:33.420 --> 03:22:37.860]   There was a hardness about these men that Fidelé was used to seeing in veterans of
[03:22:37.860 --> 03:22:38.860]   battle.
[03:22:38.860 --> 03:22:43.460]   "Tell her what you told me," Agost said.
[03:22:43.460 --> 03:22:48.700]   "We come from Drassel," one said, "sent South in search of allies.
[03:22:48.700 --> 03:22:53.300]   Allies for whom," Fidelé asked, "who do you fight for?
[03:22:53.300 --> 03:23:02.420]   We fight for Corbin, the Bright Star," the three men said together.
[03:23:02.420 --> 03:23:04.420]   CHAPTER 14
[03:23:04.420 --> 03:23:08.060]   MACHINE
[03:23:08.060 --> 03:23:12.900]   MACHINE rolled in the dirt, grunting as his attacker butted him in the mouth.
[03:23:12.900 --> 03:23:18.260]   He spat blood into the man's face, butted him back, and felt the grip on his wrist loosen.
[03:23:18.260 --> 03:23:22.820]   Then he was rolling free, pulling a knife from his boot.
[03:23:22.820 --> 03:23:25.500]   The man, facing him, climbed to his feet.
[03:23:25.500 --> 03:23:31.820]   He was small, lean with wiry muscle, face a burn-scarred mess.
[03:23:31.820 --> 03:23:33.460]   We have much in common.
[03:23:33.460 --> 03:23:39.420]   "Whatever," he promised you, "J.L.'s not worth it," McKean growled.
[03:23:39.420 --> 03:23:44.900]   "Gold's always worth it," the man snarled back, pulling a knife of his own from his
[03:23:44.900 --> 03:23:47.340]   sheath at his back.
[03:23:47.340 --> 03:23:52.500]   McKean lunged in their blades, clashing, sparking, McKean ducking a hooked punch, pivoting
[03:23:52.500 --> 03:23:57.780]   away, swaying back in close, knife stabbing for his enemy's throat.
[03:23:57.780 --> 03:24:00.660]   He was blocked, the man backing away.
[03:24:00.660 --> 03:24:06.820]   They parted and circled, McKean crouched and circling like a stalking wolf.
[03:24:06.820 --> 03:24:09.220]   A bellowing roar rang out.
[03:24:09.220 --> 03:24:13.380]   McKean's eyes were drawn to the battle about them, Alsion was there, hacking with his two
[03:24:13.380 --> 03:24:17.900]   woodsman's axes at a cadet shim that were standing over another giant figure.
[03:24:17.900 --> 03:24:19.900]   Alsion's son?
[03:24:19.900 --> 03:24:25.420]   The cadet shim's head arked through the air, black mist hissing from the collapsing corpse.
[03:24:25.420 --> 03:24:29.460]   A scuffing of earth drew McKean back to his enemy.
[03:24:29.460 --> 03:24:33.220]   He swayed left, avoided a knife in the eye, kicked out.
[03:24:33.220 --> 03:24:38.260]   His foot connecting with a knee, heard cartilage crunch, then McKean was in close, plunging
[03:24:38.260 --> 03:24:41.300]   his knife into his enemy's belly.
[03:24:41.300 --> 03:24:45.980]   He twisted the blade, ripped it free and shoved the slumping figure away.
[03:24:45.980 --> 03:24:52.540]   "Can't take gold where you're going," McKean grunted at the dying man.
[03:24:52.540 --> 03:24:56.780]   He didn't answer, eyes were already glazing and vacant.
[03:24:56.780 --> 03:25:01.300]   The battle around him was all but done, the cadet shim that had fallen back from Gundell's
[03:25:01.300 --> 03:25:06.820]   honour guard all slain, though many men had fallen to their blades.
[03:25:06.820 --> 03:25:11.140]   A scattering of Gundell's other warriors were still fighting against the black and silver
[03:25:11.140 --> 03:25:14.900]   of Krelis's men, but they were all but broken.
[03:25:14.900 --> 03:25:21.780]   McKean stared into the distance, searching for JL, but I know the direction he was running.
[03:25:21.780 --> 03:25:25.860]   His eyes lifted over the tents to look towards the road and embankment that cut into form
[03:25:25.860 --> 03:25:30.980]   forest, fastest way out of here.
[03:25:30.980 --> 03:25:35.140]   Alcyon and Reyna were lifting their sun from the ground.
[03:25:35.140 --> 03:25:39.540]   McKean approached them, retrieving his short swords as he did so.
[03:25:39.540 --> 03:25:43.940]   The giant ling was loose-limbed, a cut on his temple swelling, but other than that he
[03:25:43.940 --> 03:25:45.380]   looked well enough.
[03:25:45.380 --> 03:25:52.580]   "He'll live," McKean said, then, "my thanks for following me."
[03:25:52.580 --> 03:26:02.100]   The giant shrugged, "Reina has spoken to me of you, of what you did for her, and Tane."
[03:26:02.100 --> 03:26:04.340]   McKean didn't know what to say about that.
[03:26:04.340 --> 03:26:07.460]   He looked beyond the giant sort of scattering of the warriors he had been put under his
[03:26:07.460 --> 03:26:12.060]   command, realized that the sight of JL had driven all else from his mind.
[03:26:12.060 --> 03:26:19.060]   "Albon?" he asked, "On the hill, waiting for Krellis," the giant said.
[03:26:19.060 --> 03:26:25.180]   "I'm here," a voice called, Krellis, emerging from an aisle between tents.
[03:26:25.180 --> 03:26:26.820]   He was blood-soaked and grinning.
[03:26:26.820 --> 03:26:32.140]   "Remind me to listen to you next time you say you have a plan," he said to McKean.
[03:26:32.140 --> 03:26:36.220]   "The plan's not done until Gondol's dead," McKean said.
[03:26:36.220 --> 03:26:40.540]   "Aye, where is that little snot-nosed arseling?"
[03:26:40.540 --> 03:26:43.100]   "Albon got him trussed up on the hill."
[03:26:43.100 --> 03:26:48.780]   "No," McKean grunted, his fled with a few score catishim about him.
[03:26:48.780 --> 03:26:51.580]   "That way," he pointed.
[03:26:51.580 --> 03:26:56.740]   "Well, what we doing standing here, flapping our jaws then?"
[03:26:56.740 --> 03:26:59.340]   "Just what I was thinking."
[03:26:59.340 --> 03:27:04.780]   Krellis tugged on his beard, eyes narrowing as he looked the way Gondol had fled.
[03:27:04.780 --> 03:27:09.100]   "Best go and tell Albon to follow us," Krellis said to McKean.
[03:27:09.100 --> 03:27:12.700]   "We'll need all the swords we can muster against those damned catishim."
[03:27:12.700 --> 03:27:16.620]   "Send someone else," McKean said as he strode away.
[03:27:16.620 --> 03:27:18.780]   "I'm going after Gondol."
[03:27:18.780 --> 03:27:20.700]   And jail.
[03:27:20.700 --> 03:27:25.580]   Chapter 15
[03:27:25.580 --> 03:27:27.420]   Veridus
[03:27:27.420 --> 03:27:34.700]   "Shield wall!" Veridus shouted, lifting his borrowed shield and expecting
[03:27:34.700 --> 03:27:36.540]   those either side of him to lock into place.
[03:27:37.740 --> 03:27:40.780]   There was a sporadic thudding as shields came up,
[03:27:40.780 --> 03:27:42.860]   lacking the control discipline that he was used to.
[03:27:42.860 --> 03:27:49.100]   "These men are not my drag's teeth, not veterans of a score of battles in a shield wall."
[03:27:49.100 --> 03:27:50.940]   He bit back a curse.
[03:27:50.940 --> 03:27:53.100]   "I am lucky they are here at all."
[03:27:53.100 --> 03:27:57.660]   When Veridus had spoken of using the shield wall to clear the road,
[03:27:57.660 --> 03:27:59.740]   Krellis had curled a lip and discussed.
[03:27:59.740 --> 03:28:04.620]   Veridus' brother had never liked the idea of men fighting in such a way.
[03:28:04.620 --> 03:28:06.140]   To him, it lacked honor.
[03:28:07.420 --> 03:28:09.420]   "It works, and it will save lives."
[03:28:09.420 --> 03:28:14.300]   Even as Veridus had said the words, he'd heard in a fair's voice echoing them in his mind.
[03:28:14.300 --> 03:28:20.940]   "Your task is to keep the road clear and then to hold it," Albin had said,
[03:28:20.940 --> 03:28:22.300]   stepping in between the two brothers.
[03:28:22.300 --> 03:28:25.580]   "Now how you do it is your decision, Veridus?
[03:28:25.580 --> 03:28:30.540]   Only guard our backs and stop the reinforcements that will surely come from further along the road."
[03:28:30.540 --> 03:28:35.180]   Krellis had said no more, and so the plan had proceeded.
[03:28:35.180 --> 03:28:39.420]   Krellis, attacking the road from the north, Albin and McKean spearheading two smaller groups
[03:28:39.420 --> 03:28:44.380]   into the camp, Veridus and his reserve group holding the road as Krellis moved on to the main
[03:28:44.380 --> 03:28:47.900]   camp and guarding against the counter attack that would inevitably come.
[03:28:47.900 --> 03:28:52.540]   So far, it had all gone remarkably smoothly.
[03:28:52.540 --> 03:28:57.260]   The enemy, breaking and scattering surprised and ferocity shattering any resistance
[03:28:57.260 --> 03:28:58.940]   before it had a chance to form fully.
[03:28:58.940 --> 03:29:04.940]   It's amazing what a small and focused force can do against a larger unprepared one.
[03:29:05.340 --> 03:29:10.060]   He took a deep breath, knew that battle was close,
[03:29:10.060 --> 03:29:13.340]   tried to calm the anger he felt bubbling away inside his chest.
[03:29:13.340 --> 03:29:17.500]   That was his overwhelming emotion right now, anger.
[03:29:17.500 --> 03:29:22.620]   He was angry with Caledus, for the web of lies and deception he had woven,
[03:29:22.620 --> 03:29:27.660]   and for what he had done to Nefair, but that was nothing beside the anger he felt for his old friend.
[03:29:27.660 --> 03:29:31.580]   Nefair, how could you believe Caledus?
[03:29:31.580 --> 03:29:33.740]   Why did you not resist or come to me sooner?
[03:29:34.620 --> 03:29:36.380]   We could have stood against Caledus together.
[03:29:36.380 --> 03:29:40.700]   And most of all, he was angry with himself.
[03:29:40.700 --> 03:29:42.700]   I am a fool.
[03:29:42.700 --> 03:29:45.900]   How did I not see it all happening about me?
[03:29:45.900 --> 03:29:47.020]   Veridus the loyal.
[03:29:47.020 --> 03:29:49.100]   Veridus the trustworthy.
[03:29:49.100 --> 03:29:51.100]   Veridus the blind idiot, I say.
[03:29:51.100 --> 03:29:53.260]   Calm yourself.
[03:29:53.260 --> 03:29:55.580]   Focus, you have a battle to fight.
[03:29:55.580 --> 03:30:01.100]   He had gathered his 200 on the embankment to the northeast of the camp,
[03:30:01.100 --> 03:30:04.380]   at the point where the road left the camp behind and plowed into the forest.
[03:30:05.260 --> 03:30:12.220]   From this vantage point, Veridus had watched Krelis, Albon, and McKean flood through the camp with their small bands of men.
[03:30:12.220 --> 03:30:18.380]   Fires and great ploughs of smoke marked their paths as they moved ever deeper,
[03:30:18.380 --> 03:30:21.100]   inexorably towards the hill with Gundel's command tent on it.
[03:30:21.100 --> 03:30:28.380]   It seen movement on the hill, what looked like combat, though it was hard to discern any details because of the distance.
[03:30:28.380 --> 03:30:33.580]   Now the flames and smoke were so dense that it was hard to see anything at all,
[03:30:33.580 --> 03:30:36.460]   but Veridus' attention was needed elsewhere anyway.
[03:30:36.460 --> 03:30:41.820]   To his left, in a depth of fawn, men were approaching along the road.
[03:30:41.820 --> 03:30:49.900]   Veridus saw a knot of warriors in mail and leather at the front and centre of a much larger horde that spilt down the embankments to either side.
[03:30:49.900 --> 03:30:52.060]   At least a thousand strong.
[03:30:52.060 --> 03:30:56.860]   Finally, the shields either side of Veridus locked into his.
[03:30:58.140 --> 03:31:09.020]   He felt the urge to order the march, knew that the shield wall moving towards a larger foe had always caused hesitation and sewn seeds of fear in the enemy, but he was uncertain of the men about him.
[03:31:09.020 --> 03:31:13.820]   Just getting into formation on the road and forming the shield wall, it seemed to tax them.
[03:31:13.820 --> 03:31:19.180]   He glanced at the warrior to his right. A young man, his beard, a straggly thing.
[03:31:19.180 --> 03:31:23.340]   "Young, I know him. It is Balon."
[03:31:24.780 --> 03:31:28.140]   "He is only a few years younger than I. We used to spar together."
[03:31:28.140 --> 03:31:35.660]   But Veridus felt older than his years, knew that his travels and experience in the shield wall set him apart from most of those about him.
[03:31:35.660 --> 03:31:43.580]   "I can't expect too much from them yet. They only know this much because in the fair order that all men of Tenenborough were drilled in the shield wall."
[03:31:43.580 --> 03:31:47.260]   "It will have to do," Veridus thought.
[03:31:48.300 --> 03:31:57.420]   "Marching may be a step too far. We'll wait here for them. We fill the road and block the path to the camp so they'll have to cut us down and march through us to get at Krelis's flank."
[03:31:57.420 --> 03:32:08.220]   Looking at the men around him, earnest, brave men of thousand leeks from home, he felt some of his anger drain, replaced with sympathy and a deep sense of responsibility for them.
[03:32:08.220 --> 03:32:13.980]   "Balon, listen to me," Veridus said to the warrior beside him.
[03:32:13.980 --> 03:32:17.740]   The man returned his gaze and Veridus saw fear in his eyes.
[03:32:18.620 --> 03:32:21.580]   "Follow my orders and we'll come through this."
[03:32:21.580 --> 03:32:25.020]   The warrior nodded at him, then looked away.
[03:32:25.020 --> 03:32:29.500]   Shouts and challenges grew louder as the enemy came closer.
[03:32:29.500 --> 03:32:42.540]   "If they get past us, our kin and sword brothers die," Veridus yelled, feeling the blood begin to surge through his veins, fear and excitement merging into the exhilaration that he always felt before battle.
[03:32:43.260 --> 03:32:46.620]   "Remember your oaths and fight for your sword brother beside you."
[03:32:46.620 --> 03:32:50.380]   He felt Balon stand straighter alongside him.
[03:32:50.380 --> 03:32:59.020]   They were inexperienced, but to the warband of Gondal that was approaching him, the shield war was like nothing they had ever seen before.
[03:32:59.020 --> 03:33:07.180]   Veridus saw the front ranks of the enemy slow, close enough now to see looks of confusion and worry upon their faces.
[03:33:08.700 --> 03:33:16.300]   Warriors were a superstitious bunch, always wary of the unknown. "Sods!" Veridus shouted, drawing a short blade at his hip.
[03:33:16.300 --> 03:33:21.500]   "About and behind him he heard the hiss of iron leaving leather."
[03:33:21.500 --> 03:33:31.980]   He began to thump his hilt upon the wooden boards of his shield, the rhythmic pounding taken up first by those about him, then spreading, rippling through the deep wall of 200 men.
[03:33:33.660 --> 03:33:39.820]   He saw its effect upon those approaching, warriors hesitating in their steps, uncertainty spreading like a mist.
[03:33:39.820 --> 03:33:47.180]   Then one warrior stepped from the crowd, a big man clad in mail, a helm of iron, his sword raised high.
[03:33:47.180 --> 03:33:51.580]   He bellowed a wordless challenge and ran at Veridus's wall of shields.
[03:33:51.580 --> 03:34:01.180]   A trickle of men followed him, warriors from the centre, then others, warriors, woodsmen and labourers from the flanks, all screaming blood and murder.
[03:34:01.980 --> 03:34:07.020]   "Ready!" Veridus roared, spreading his feet and leaning forwards into his shield.
[03:34:07.020 --> 03:34:14.140]   A thread of fear clenched in his belly as it always did in this moment when battle was inevitable but not yet joined.
[03:34:14.140 --> 03:34:26.300]   Then men were crashing into his shield, blows raining upon it, shuddering through his wrist and arm into his shoulder, numbing muscle and sinew, and the fear was gone.
[03:34:28.060 --> 03:34:40.060]   A face appeared above his shield rim, snarling at him. "Now!" Veridus bellowed, stabbing his shortsword through the thin gap between his shield and balance, to either side, warriors doing the same.
[03:34:40.060 --> 03:34:45.900]   He felt his blade bite into flesh, drew it back red, stabbed again.
[03:34:47.180 --> 03:35:01.500]   The face above his shield rim disappeared, replaced by another, he stabbed again, felt his blade turn on mail, drew it back and stabbed lower, heard a scream, kept stabbing, not frantically as Ballon was doing beside him, but steady, a rhythm to it.
[03:35:01.500 --> 03:35:06.220]   "Easy!" Veridus barked at Ballon. "They're not going anywhere!"
[03:35:06.220 --> 03:35:13.260]   Ballon shot to a glance, eyes wide and white, but his blade worked became less frantic.
[03:35:15.020 --> 03:35:24.780]   Men fell, blood sloosing down Veridus's blade, soaking his hand, muscles burning, the unrelenting thud of blows against his shield, pushing his straining body to its limits.
[03:35:24.780 --> 03:35:36.700]   Sinew screamed against the constant pressure as men piled against the shield wall, some throwing themselves, others crushed by the oncoming mass behind them like the sea against a tidal wall.
[03:35:38.540 --> 03:35:46.060]   Fingers grabbed at the rim of Veridus's shield, pulling it down, and Veridus saw a woodsman, caught a glimpse of the road and forest behind him.
[03:35:46.060 --> 03:35:50.700]   Veridus chopped, another scream as fingers flew through the air.
[03:35:50.700 --> 03:35:59.820]   The constant pressure was easing, still the thud of weapons as men hammered at the wall, but the unrelenting press of bodies was gone.
[03:36:01.580 --> 03:36:09.980]   "The end is coming," Veridus recognized, when the initial rush of that first battle fury was spent, and men looked about at the carnage reaped by the shield wall.
[03:36:09.980 --> 03:36:19.820]   He had seen it before, knew that the ground would be piled with the dead, warrior spirits crushed by the shield wall's faceless brutality.
[03:36:19.820 --> 03:36:23.420]   "We must strike now and break them."
[03:36:24.540 --> 03:36:32.140]   "Forward!" Veridus cried. He punched Balan to his right to get his attention, yelled his command again and took a step forwards.
[03:36:32.140 --> 03:36:40.300]   For a moment, he thought he was alone, stepping out of the wall into certain death, but then Balan followed him.
[03:36:40.300 --> 03:36:48.220]   A heartbeat later the man on his either side doing the same, and with a stutter the front row of the shield wall took one shambling step forwards.
[03:36:49.740 --> 03:36:56.300]   Veridus stumbled on a body underfoot that managed to stay upright, even though the ground was slick with blood and snared with limbs.
[03:36:56.300 --> 03:37:04.860]   He felt the line sway, thought that the wall would splinter, break, and be scattered, but then it steadied.
[03:37:04.860 --> 03:37:08.780]   Veridus felt the strength and solidity return.
[03:37:08.780 --> 03:37:17.180]   He set his feet and stabbed through the gap in the shield's felt his sword pierce flesh, heard more screams as others did the same.
[03:37:18.140 --> 03:37:24.060]   "It's working." "Forward!" Veridus yelled again, and did not wait this time to take another step.
[03:37:24.060 --> 03:37:29.260]   The shield wall shuttered forwards, swords snaked out, more men falling, dying.
[03:37:29.260 --> 03:37:34.620]   "March!" Veridus shouted, his voice hoarse and dry.
[03:37:34.620 --> 03:37:40.060]   Bagging his sword against his shield to set time, he felt the whole shield wall move with him,
[03:37:40.060 --> 03:37:45.900]   some of the men behind him thudding their swords against shields in time with him, the front row still stabbing as they marched.
[03:37:47.580 --> 03:37:51.980]   They were a ragged mass compared to the disciplined ranks that Veridus was accustomed to leading,
[03:37:51.980 --> 03:37:56.060]   but still he grinned with the joy of it as his enemy fell before him,
[03:37:56.060 --> 03:38:02.060]   felt as if they were unbeatable, unstoppable, and then the pressure before them was gone.
[03:38:02.060 --> 03:38:06.540]   The sound of feet drumming on the road as men turned and ran before them.
[03:38:06.540 --> 03:38:13.740]   Veridus called a halt. The wall stumbled to a ragged stop, and Veridus lowered his shield.
[03:38:15.500 --> 03:38:22.220]   Bodies lay strewn everywhere. Trees loomed before them, the camp ablaze behind.
[03:38:22.220 --> 03:38:27.900]   Dimfigures could be seen fleeing along the road, some escaping into the gloom of the forest
[03:38:27.900 --> 03:38:36.380]   either side of the road, not enough to challenge us again. Relief flooded through him. They are broken.
[03:38:36.380 --> 03:38:45.020]   "We've won!" They had all known that the greatest threat would come from the warriors and workers who were away from the camp,
[03:38:45.020 --> 03:38:49.420]   spread along the road. They were the ones who would be alerted to the attack,
[03:38:49.420 --> 03:38:54.780]   would be able to gather their courage and attack, and like all those within the camp who would be caught by surprise.
[03:38:54.780 --> 03:39:02.380]   He looked and saw Bannon grinning. The recognition of survival, the joy of victory,
[03:39:02.380 --> 03:39:05.100]   saw the same expression spreading amongst those about him.
[03:39:05.100 --> 03:39:13.420]   Then voices yelled a warning. Death screens rang out. Veridus spun around,
[03:39:13.420 --> 03:39:15.660]   searching for the new danger. It came from behind.
[03:39:15.660 --> 03:39:20.140]   Figures were emerging from the camp, a solid mass of warriors appearing,
[03:39:20.140 --> 03:39:24.700]   dressed in black mail, curved swords in their hands. "Caddishim!"
[03:39:24.700 --> 03:39:30.460]   They were running up the embankment, carving into the flank and rear of Veridus's shield wall,
[03:39:30.460 --> 03:39:36.460]   20, 40, 60 of them, more appearing from amongst the tents as well as a tight knot of others behind them.
[03:39:37.580 --> 03:39:45.660]   Gundl and his honor guard. He cannot get away. Veridus began moving towards the Caddishim,
[03:39:45.660 --> 03:39:50.460]   even as his mouth opened to shout for the wall to reform, he knew it would not defeat these
[03:39:50.460 --> 03:39:56.620]   demons spawn. "We have to take their heads, and the wall will not help us do that."
[03:39:56.620 --> 03:40:02.940]   He saw men crunching shields together, falling back on the strategy that had just served them so
[03:40:02.940 --> 03:40:07.900]   well, but a handful of Caddishim leapt at the hastily formed wall, ripped it apart with savage
[03:40:07.900 --> 03:40:14.300]   fury, swords rising and falling in deadly arcs. "My men are dying, the Caddishim are slaughtering
[03:40:14.300 --> 03:40:19.500]   my men." Veridus broke into a run and hurled himself at the Caddishim.
[03:40:19.500 --> 03:40:24.300]   Chapter 16
[03:40:24.300 --> 03:40:26.140]   J.L.
[03:40:28.780 --> 03:40:34.060]   J.L. ran through the camp with every jarling step, every wheezing breath, trying to somehow
[03:40:34.060 --> 03:40:39.500]   lessen the pain of his broken ribs. Though that doesn't seem to be working. Blood was still leaking
[03:40:39.500 --> 03:40:44.300]   into his eyes from a wound on his forehead, and my king's sword cut on his leg and forearm burned
[03:40:44.300 --> 03:40:49.100]   as if he'd been branded. He took me by surprise, before I was ready.
[03:40:49.100 --> 03:40:55.260]   He risked a look over his shoulder, relieved to see that there was no lunatic arm to the brim
[03:40:55.260 --> 03:41:00.300]   with knives chasing after him. In fact, no one was in sight before or behind.
[03:41:00.300 --> 03:41:07.260]   It felt as if he was alone in a world of white tents and narrow aisles, of smoke and fire and
[03:41:07.260 --> 03:41:12.860]   distant screams. The last he'd seen of McKean had been rolling in the dirt with a dag.
[03:41:12.860 --> 03:41:17.820]   He looked like a man with a serious grudge, and I really could do without that right now.
[03:41:17.820 --> 03:41:24.540]   Could be that dag has killed McKean. Much as he wanted to believe it, he wasn't convinced.
[03:41:25.260 --> 03:41:28.220]   The ease with which McKean had shattered his ribs had shock jail.
[03:41:28.220 --> 03:41:34.540]   How did he move so fast? It must have been a lucky blow. He's old and broken.
[03:41:34.540 --> 03:41:41.180]   He heard screaming off to his left and so veered right, taking a new path through abandoned tents
[03:41:41.180 --> 03:41:44.300]   and cookfires. No more battle if I can help it.
[03:41:44.300 --> 03:41:50.700]   Ahead of him, the trees have fallen loomed, overlooking the fringes of the camp like a tribe
[03:41:50.700 --> 03:41:57.020]   of Dawa Ogres. Nearly out of this hellhole, even if McKean still breathes, he'll never find me now.
[03:41:57.020 --> 03:42:03.820]   I just have to find my men. Three hundred swords waiting for me, half a leg along Gundell's cursed
[03:42:03.820 --> 03:42:12.300]   road. McLama of battle drifted down to jail. He was travelling straight towards it. He didn't
[03:42:12.300 --> 03:42:18.940]   turn away this time, though, as it was exactly where he needed to go. My men are out there somewhere,
[03:42:18.940 --> 03:42:22.380]   and if I'm going to get out of four and alive, I will need them about me.
[03:42:22.380 --> 03:42:30.780]   So jail gritted his teeth and ran on. He emerged from the tent into a scene of carnage.
[03:42:30.780 --> 03:42:36.700]   Warriors were masked upon the road. More of the enemy in the black and silver of Tenenbrel,
[03:42:36.700 --> 03:42:40.380]   but to jail's pleasant surprise, the Jihar were loose amongst them.
[03:42:40.380 --> 03:42:46.300]   The road was a heaving mass of battle. The path into the forest blocked for the moment,
[03:42:46.300 --> 03:42:51.580]   but the Jihar were doing all that they could about that. Even as jail watched,
[03:42:51.580 --> 03:42:55.820]   he saw one of the Jihar lift a warrior into the air and a hurl him down the embankment.
[03:42:55.820 --> 03:43:00.620]   He might be able to sneak through in the chaos, he thought, and began to climb.
[03:43:00.620 --> 03:43:06.700]   Then he saw Gundell. The young king of Carnotan was standing upon the road,
[03:43:06.700 --> 03:43:10.860]   separate from the battle. His sycophants huddled about him, though their numbers looked somewhat
[03:43:10.860 --> 03:43:16.300]   thinned. About them were a dozen or so Jihar warriors. The rest of Gundell's honor guard
[03:43:16.300 --> 03:43:20.460]   trying to carve away through the wall of flesh and bone that barred the way to escape.
[03:43:20.460 --> 03:43:28.300]   From what jail could see, they were doing a good job of it. Stick with Gundell or try and sneak past.
[03:43:28.300 --> 03:43:35.660]   A warrior in black and silver flew through the air. A hand span from jail struck the ground and
[03:43:35.660 --> 03:43:40.380]   rolled bonelessly down the embankment, crashing into a tent and bringing it down around him.
[03:43:41.180 --> 03:43:45.980]   Jail reached the road and tried to skirt the combat which had broken down into a series
[03:43:45.980 --> 03:43:52.300]   of scattered and brutal skirmishes. The enemy looked to be rallying against the Jihar,
[03:43:52.300 --> 03:43:57.820]   one man leading a charge that sent two of those disturbing black mists jetting into the air.
[03:43:57.820 --> 03:44:02.860]   "But, eh, damn you!" Jail muttered at the enemy. "Don't rally!"
[03:44:04.140 --> 03:44:11.260]   Jail, a voice called. And for a terrifying moment, Jail thought it was McCain. His head
[03:44:11.260 --> 03:44:15.260]   jerked around to see Gundell waving wildly to him from the midst of his protectors.
[03:44:15.260 --> 03:44:21.660]   "Over here!" Gundell beckoned him. For a moment, Jail considered his options and quickly
[03:44:21.660 --> 03:44:28.060]   concluded that he was safer within a ring of Jihar warriors. He hobbled over to Gundell
[03:44:28.060 --> 03:44:33.420]   and Jihar stepping out of the way to let him through. "I'm glad you're still alive," Gundell said.
[03:44:33.980 --> 03:44:36.140]   "300 men, you say? Where are they?"
[03:44:36.140 --> 03:44:40.700]   For a moment, Jail didn't understand what Gundell was talking about.
[03:44:40.700 --> 03:44:44.860]   Then he realized he was referring to Jail's men left waiting further along the road.
[03:44:44.860 --> 03:44:51.820]   Not a complete idiot then. "That way," Jail pointed over the combat before them into
[03:44:51.820 --> 03:44:57.260]   the dark tunnel of the road. "Good. The rassel is that way too,
[03:44:57.260 --> 03:45:00.060]   and a few hundred more swords around me would be a good thing."
[03:45:01.580 --> 03:45:06.620]   He looked back at his camp, at the flames and the black clouds of smoke at the dead scattered all
[03:45:06.620 --> 03:45:12.540]   around. "Look what they've done," Gundell wailed, face twisting in misery.
[03:45:12.540 --> 03:45:15.180]   "They've destroyed my camp. Crushed my warband."
[03:45:15.180 --> 03:45:20.780]   "Most hope they don't do it to you too, you whining little worm, and more importantly not to me.
[03:45:20.780 --> 03:45:25.740]   We need to move," Jail muttered, not liking the feeling of standing still.
[03:45:27.500 --> 03:45:30.620]   The knowledge that McKean was out there somewhere, hunting him,
[03:45:30.620 --> 03:45:35.900]   hovered at the back of his mind like a black cloud. "Yes, onwards," Gundell yelled.
[03:45:35.900 --> 03:45:40.300]   A Jihar warrior turned its black eyes upon Gundell,
[03:45:40.300 --> 03:45:43.420]   then with a shrug began to lead their small group along the road.
[03:45:43.420 --> 03:45:48.220]   The other Jihar, a dozen left with Gundell at best,
[03:45:48.220 --> 03:45:51.740]   fanned out in a tight half circle, pushing into the fringes of battle.
[03:45:52.940 --> 03:45:57.180]   Then something crashed into their group from the left, sending men tumbling,
[03:45:57.180 --> 03:45:59.740]   Jihar reeling, turning to face this new attack.
[03:45:59.740 --> 03:46:03.260]   Jail staggered into one of Gundell's followers,
[03:46:03.260 --> 03:46:05.340]   shoving the man to the ground as he rited himself.
[03:46:05.340 --> 03:46:09.660]   They'd been attacked by a knot of warriors in black and silver,
[03:46:09.660 --> 03:46:13.100]   charged and rammed by them, all with shields raised and interlocked.
[03:46:13.100 --> 03:46:17.820]   Even as he looked, short swords darted out from the small wall of shields.
[03:46:17.820 --> 03:46:22.460]   Two of Gundell's followers were caught in the attack and fell, pierced many times.
[03:46:23.100 --> 03:46:26.140]   Gundell was shrieking, waving his sword around, ineffectually.
[03:46:26.140 --> 03:46:30.220]   Jail saw blades sink into the flesh of a Jihar,
[03:46:30.220 --> 03:46:33.340]   but it shrugged off the blows and grabbed a shield rim,
[03:46:33.340 --> 03:46:36.860]   dragging the warrior behind it forwards and chopping into his neck,
[03:46:36.860 --> 03:46:39.340]   sending him crashing to the ground in a spray of blood.
[03:46:39.340 --> 03:46:46.700]   The small shield wall fractured, men breaking away and attacking Gundell's party the old way,
[03:46:46.700 --> 03:46:50.700]   man to man. Not a wise choice against the Jihar.
[03:46:52.380 --> 03:46:56.380]   Jail backed away, put a few of Gundell's followers between him and this new attack.
[03:46:56.380 --> 03:46:59.020]   I'm scared of no man, but...
[03:46:59.020 --> 03:47:02.220]   He put a hand to be throbbing ribs,
[03:47:02.220 --> 03:47:04.700]   glanced down at the blood, crusting his thigh.
[03:47:04.700 --> 03:47:08.860]   Another warrior came at the first Jihar,
[03:47:08.860 --> 03:47:11.740]   this man in a black and silver commander's quirass,
[03:47:11.740 --> 03:47:15.260]   using sword and shield together to push the creature back a pace,
[03:47:15.260 --> 03:47:17.740]   sword darting out to stab at its thigh,
[03:47:17.740 --> 03:47:19.820]   shield boss punching into the Jihar's face.
[03:47:21.100 --> 03:47:23.100]   There was something familiar about the warrior.
[03:47:23.100 --> 03:47:25.340]   I know him.
[03:47:25.340 --> 03:47:29.340]   The Jihar staggered back a few steps,
[03:47:29.340 --> 03:47:31.820]   black blood dripping from its broken nose.
[03:47:31.820 --> 03:47:36.860]   Its face twisted in a snarl as it launched itself forwards,
[03:47:36.860 --> 03:47:38.620]   shoulder ramming into the warrior,
[03:47:38.620 --> 03:47:40.140]   sending him stumbling backwards,
[03:47:40.140 --> 03:47:41.980]   tripping over a corpse and falling hard.
[03:47:41.980 --> 03:47:46.780]   The Jihar stood over him, curved sword rising,
[03:47:46.780 --> 03:47:48.540]   then another figure was there,
[03:47:48.540 --> 03:47:50.620]   plunging a spear into the Jihar's throat.
[03:47:51.420 --> 03:47:52.940]   A woman.
[03:47:52.940 --> 03:47:57.180]   She was dressed in travelling fur and leather,
[03:47:57.180 --> 03:47:59.660]   richly made, dark hair pulled back tight.
[03:47:59.660 --> 03:48:03.260]   Then warriors were swarming either side of her,
[03:48:03.260 --> 03:48:06.460]   chopping at the wounded Jihar as she wrenched her spear free.
[03:48:06.460 --> 03:48:11.180]   The Jihar warrior went down in a hail of blows,
[03:48:11.180 --> 03:48:12.700]   its head hacked from its body,
[03:48:12.700 --> 03:48:14.620]   that black mist spilling from its neck.
[03:48:14.620 --> 03:48:18.380]   A figure formed in the air, black winged and red-eyed,
[03:48:18.380 --> 03:48:19.420]   hissing its fury,
[03:48:20.060 --> 03:48:20.700]   then it was gone.
[03:48:20.700 --> 03:48:23.340]   Only a few ragged wisps remaining.
[03:48:23.340 --> 03:48:25.980]   I wish they'd stopped doing that.
[03:48:25.980 --> 03:48:29.740]   Gondol was screaming orders to attack,
[03:48:29.740 --> 03:48:31.740]   though nobody seemed to be paying much attention to him.
[03:48:31.740 --> 03:48:35.820]   Most of his hangars on were running in different directions.
[03:48:35.820 --> 03:48:39.100]   Jihar saw one of the Jihar grabbed Gondol by the scruff of his neck
[03:48:39.100 --> 03:48:41.020]   and start dragging him through the crowd,
[03:48:41.020 --> 03:48:43.820]   three or four Jihar carving away for him through the melee.
[03:48:43.820 --> 03:48:47.100]   Gondol spluttered a protest,
[03:48:47.100 --> 03:48:48.620]   but the Jihar just marched,
[03:48:48.620 --> 03:48:49.420]   resolutely on.
[03:48:49.420 --> 03:48:52.780]   Jael lurched into motion,
[03:48:52.780 --> 03:48:55.100]   saw them as his best way of getting out of this
[03:48:55.100 --> 03:48:56.540]   and stumbled close behind them.
[03:48:56.540 --> 03:49:00.300]   The huddle of warriors crashed into them,
[03:49:00.300 --> 03:49:03.420]   mostly enemy all striking at a Jihar in their midst.
[03:49:03.420 --> 03:49:05.580]   With a grimace,
[03:49:05.580 --> 03:49:08.940]   Jael drew his sword and pulled a knife from his belt.
[03:49:08.940 --> 03:49:12.300]   Pain over death always the better option.
[03:49:12.300 --> 03:49:15.740]   He hacked at a warrior's head,
[03:49:15.740 --> 03:49:18.540]   bursts of agony pulsing from his damaged ribs.
[03:49:18.540 --> 03:49:21.820]   He dented the man's helm,
[03:49:21.820 --> 03:49:23.900]   then slashed at another with his knife,
[03:49:23.900 --> 03:49:25.660]   leaving a long red wound,
[03:49:25.660 --> 03:49:27.500]   this warrior lurching away.
[03:49:27.500 --> 03:49:28.700]   Then they were past them,
[03:49:28.700 --> 03:49:31.740]   Jael, adding his blades to the Jihar as they cut,
[03:49:31.740 --> 03:49:32.380]   hewed,
[03:49:32.380 --> 03:49:34.860]   punched and stabbed their way through the battling mass.
[03:49:34.860 --> 03:49:37.580]   After his left,
[03:49:37.580 --> 03:49:40.620]   Jael saw the woman still wielding her spear,
[03:49:40.620 --> 03:49:42.380]   a group of warriors tight about her.
[03:49:42.380 --> 03:49:44.460]   He had seen her before.
[03:49:45.100 --> 03:49:47.420]   At the great council of Aquillus in Jerelin,
[03:49:47.420 --> 03:49:49.020]   he blinked,
[03:49:49.020 --> 03:49:50.700]   as recognition dawned.
[03:49:50.700 --> 03:49:52.700]   Fidalei,
[03:49:52.700 --> 03:49:56.220]   Aquillus' wife or widow now,
[03:49:56.220 --> 03:49:57.820]   an affair's mother.
[03:49:57.820 --> 03:50:00.140]   What is she doing here?
[03:50:00.140 --> 03:50:02.700]   And fighting against the affair's ally.
[03:50:02.700 --> 03:50:05.420]   He grunted,
[03:50:05.420 --> 03:50:07.820]   as he ducked a sword blow aimed at his head,
[03:50:07.820 --> 03:50:08.940]   chopped at an ankle,
[03:50:08.940 --> 03:50:10.300]   then glanced back to Fidalei.
[03:50:10.300 --> 03:50:12.860]   She'd make a good hostage,
[03:50:13.500 --> 03:50:15.340]   either to buy me safe passage out of here,
[03:50:15.340 --> 03:50:17.180]   or a good trophy to present an affair,
[03:50:17.180 --> 03:50:19.340]   something to win back some favour and prestige
[03:50:19.340 --> 03:50:21.500]   from the disastrous mess these campaigners become.
[03:50:21.500 --> 03:50:25.660]   They were almost through the main press of battle now.
[03:50:25.660 --> 03:50:30.220]   Jael could see empty road beyond a few clumps of combat,
[03:50:30.220 --> 03:50:32.300]   the darkness of form beckoning,
[03:50:32.300 --> 03:50:33.180]   promising safety.
[03:50:33.180 --> 03:50:37.100]   Battle cries snapped his attention back.
[03:50:37.100 --> 03:50:41.020]   Beside him, one of the Jihar fell to its knee.
[03:50:41.980 --> 03:50:43.020]   Its struggle to rise,
[03:50:43.020 --> 03:50:45.100]   but another warrior lunged in close,
[03:50:45.100 --> 03:50:47.420]   and his sword swing took the Jihar's head,
[03:50:47.420 --> 03:50:49.260]   black vapour spewed from the wound.
[03:50:49.260 --> 03:50:52.860]   The Jihar that had been dragging Gondal,
[03:50:52.860 --> 03:50:54.620]   let go of him to join the fray,
[03:50:54.620 --> 03:50:56.380]   sword rising and falling,
[03:50:56.380 --> 03:50:57.820]   a warrior staggering away
[03:50:57.820 --> 03:50:59.980]   with a terrible gash from his forehead to his chin.
[03:50:59.980 --> 03:51:04.140]   Gondal slipped and fell to the ground beside Jael,
[03:51:04.140 --> 03:51:05.180]   and grabbed at his boot.
[03:51:05.180 --> 03:51:07.820]   "Help me," Gondal cried,
[03:51:07.820 --> 03:51:11.100]   trying to climb up Jael's leg and pull himself back to his feet.
[03:51:12.060 --> 03:51:13.660]   Jael sneered down at him,
[03:51:13.660 --> 03:51:16.460]   remembering how Gondal had mocked him back in his tent.
[03:51:16.460 --> 03:51:19.900]   "I don't need you or your horses now."
[03:51:19.900 --> 03:51:23.020]   He pulled his sword back,
[03:51:23.020 --> 03:51:25.500]   and stabbed it into Gondal's screaming mouth,
[03:51:25.500 --> 03:51:28.300]   smashing teeth on into the soft tissue of his throat,
[03:51:28.300 --> 03:51:29.500]   jerked it out red,
[03:51:29.500 --> 03:51:33.580]   left the king of Carnot and bleeding out his life in the dirt of form.
[03:51:33.580 --> 03:51:36.060]   Looking up again,
[03:51:36.060 --> 03:51:39.420]   he saw that the last few moments of frantic combat
[03:51:39.420 --> 03:51:42.300]   had swung them close to the woman he was sure was fiddly.
[03:51:42.300 --> 03:51:44.300]   At last,
[03:51:44.300 --> 03:51:47.100]   fate smiles upon me once more.
[03:51:47.100 --> 03:51:50.700]   He swerved around a massive combat
[03:51:50.700 --> 03:51:52.460]   and strode straight towards her.
[03:51:52.460 --> 03:51:57.420]   Chapter 17
[03:51:57.420 --> 03:51:59.260]   Makin
[03:51:59.260 --> 03:52:04.940]   Makin burst out from the rows of tents onto the embankment.
[03:52:04.940 --> 03:52:08.780]   The tangled snare of fawned forest loomed close by,
[03:52:09.660 --> 03:52:11.260]   at the top of the embankment,
[03:52:11.260 --> 03:52:14.220]   Gondal's new road carved a line into the trees.
[03:52:14.220 --> 03:52:16.700]   Fingers fought upon it,
[03:52:16.700 --> 03:52:19.660]   the clamour and stench of combat drifting down to Makin.
[03:52:19.660 --> 03:52:21.660]   Where is he?
[03:52:21.660 --> 03:52:23.180]   Where's Jael?
[03:52:23.180 --> 03:52:27.340]   As he had run through the fractured camp,
[03:52:27.340 --> 03:52:29.660]   memory upon memory had flooded Makin's mind.
[03:52:29.660 --> 03:52:33.740]   Of a lifetime has served as Castel's oath-sworn-shieldman,
[03:52:33.740 --> 03:52:35.580]   of friendship, loyalty, and love.
[03:52:36.540 --> 03:52:39.260]   And finally, one memory overwhelming all of the others.
[03:52:39.260 --> 03:52:40.940]   Of Jael,
[03:52:40.940 --> 03:52:43.660]   plunging a sword into Castel's belly,
[03:52:43.660 --> 03:52:48.220]   those few heartbeats we played in his mind time and time again,
[03:52:48.220 --> 03:52:51.340]   until his whole world was a place of heartbreak and rage.
[03:52:51.340 --> 03:52:53.660]   Where is he?
[03:52:53.660 --> 03:52:56.140]   He came this way, I know it.
[03:52:56.140 --> 03:53:00.220]   Makin had lived in form with a gaudre
[03:53:00.220 --> 03:53:02.300]   and learned the way of wood and forest.
[03:53:02.300 --> 03:53:04.700]   Not that Jael was hard to track.
[03:53:05.980 --> 03:53:08.300]   He'd left a trail of his own blood for Makin to follow.
[03:53:08.300 --> 03:53:10.460]   But where now?
[03:53:10.460 --> 03:53:13.180]   Which way did he go?
[03:53:13.180 --> 03:53:17.100]   Makin knelt in the grass searching,
[03:53:17.100 --> 03:53:18.540]   fingertips running across the ground.
[03:53:18.540 --> 03:53:20.460]   They came away, sticky.
[03:53:20.460 --> 03:53:22.300]   Blood.
[03:53:22.300 --> 03:53:25.660]   Another patch had paced up the embankment.
[03:53:25.660 --> 03:53:30.700]   Something crossed Makin's face part snarl, part smile,
[03:53:30.700 --> 03:53:33.180]   and he bounded up the slope to the road.
[03:53:34.860 --> 03:53:36.460]   Battle was mostly finished here,
[03:53:36.460 --> 03:53:37.820]   the dead littering the ground,
[03:53:37.820 --> 03:53:40.460]   others lying and waiting for death's last touch,
[03:53:40.460 --> 03:53:41.260]   wounds gaping.
[03:53:41.260 --> 03:53:43.740]   Screens and weeping,
[03:53:43.740 --> 03:53:45.180]   ragged breaths,
[03:53:45.180 --> 03:53:48.380]   some men just sitting staring at blood-crusted palms.
[03:53:48.380 --> 03:53:52.140]   Battle still raged further along the road,
[03:53:52.140 --> 03:53:54.060]   the trees of four and a tunnel about them.
[03:53:54.060 --> 03:53:59.020]   Makin glimpsed kaddishim in their coats of dark males
[03:53:59.020 --> 03:54:01.820]   scattered amongst the black and silver of variedities' rear guard.
[03:54:03.260 --> 03:54:05.420]   A figure moved beyond the combat,
[03:54:05.420 --> 03:54:07.820]   drawing his eye disappeared, reappeared.
[03:54:07.820 --> 03:54:10.300]   A man, dark head,
[03:54:10.300 --> 03:54:12.380]   just a glimpse, but Makin knew him.
[03:54:12.380 --> 03:54:14.220]   Jail.
[03:54:14.220 --> 03:54:17.980]   He ran, leaping the fallen,
[03:54:17.980 --> 03:54:20.220]   a shortsword hissing from a scabbard across his back,
[03:54:20.220 --> 03:54:22.220]   a knife gripped in his other hand,
[03:54:22.220 --> 03:54:23.660]   never taking his eyes from jail.
[03:54:23.660 --> 03:54:28.220]   Behind him, Makin heard the drum of many feet,
[03:54:28.220 --> 03:54:30.300]   over it a heavier thud,
[03:54:30.300 --> 03:54:33.100]   knew that Alcyon and the others had arrived.
[03:54:33.740 --> 03:54:36.300]   He ran on, skirting the combat,
[03:54:36.300 --> 03:54:38.700]   glimpsed veridis with a handful of men
[03:54:38.700 --> 03:54:39.980]   bring a kaddishim to bay,
[03:54:39.980 --> 03:54:42.300]   like hounds snapping at a bear or wolfen.
[03:54:42.300 --> 03:54:45.740]   Makin gave it all barely a glance
[03:54:45.740 --> 03:54:47.420]   because he was close to jail now,
[03:54:47.420 --> 03:54:49.500]   so close he could see his eyes,
[03:54:49.500 --> 03:54:50.700]   that cut across his scalp.
[03:54:50.700 --> 03:54:55.260]   He was heading diagonally across the combat through it,
[03:54:55.260 --> 03:54:56.620]   and Makin followed,
[03:54:56.620 --> 03:54:59.100]   a wraith that wound his way through the tumult,
[03:54:59.100 --> 03:55:01.500]   ducking, bending, swaying,
[03:55:01.500 --> 03:55:02.300]   always moving.
[03:55:02.300 --> 03:55:05.020]   Dimly behind him,
[03:55:05.020 --> 03:55:07.580]   he heard voices raised in battle cry,
[03:55:07.580 --> 03:55:10.300]   Alcyon's deep base rumbling over it
[03:55:10.300 --> 03:55:11.900]   like an avalanche as he joined the fray.
[03:55:11.900 --> 03:55:15.020]   Makin hardly noticed,
[03:55:15.020 --> 03:55:15.980]   he was so close,
[03:55:15.980 --> 03:55:17.420]   a dozen paces behind jail,
[03:55:17.420 --> 03:55:19.020]   when he lost sight of him for a moment,
[03:55:19.020 --> 03:55:20.540]   heard the harsh clang of iron,
[03:55:20.540 --> 03:55:21.180]   a grunt,
[03:55:21.180 --> 03:55:23.180]   the thud of a body hitting the ground,
[03:55:23.180 --> 03:55:24.300]   then a scream,
[03:55:24.300 --> 03:55:25.020]   higher pitched,
[03:55:25.020 --> 03:55:26.460]   a woman scream.
[03:55:26.460 --> 03:55:29.980]   No, dear Elion, no,
[03:55:30.220 --> 03:55:32.460]   he knew that voice,
[03:55:32.460 --> 03:55:34.460]   would recognize it anywhere.
[03:55:34.460 --> 03:55:36.460]   Fiddly.
[03:55:36.460 --> 03:55:39.820]   He shouldered one of Ripper's warriors
[03:55:39.820 --> 03:55:42.300]   out of the way and burst through the last knot of combat.
[03:55:42.300 --> 03:55:45.580]   A warrior lay dead at his feet,
[03:55:45.580 --> 03:55:46.620]   others standing,
[03:55:46.620 --> 03:55:49.580]   pointing swords and spears at a figure further along the road.
[03:55:49.580 --> 03:55:51.500]   Jail.
[03:55:51.500 --> 03:55:54.140]   He stood facing Makin,
[03:55:54.140 --> 03:55:56.700]   one arm around Fiddly's throat,
[03:55:56.700 --> 03:55:58.860]   resting his sword blade against the pulse in her neck,
[03:55:58.860 --> 03:56:01.340]   his other hand holding a knife tight to her ribs.
[03:56:01.340 --> 03:56:03.660]   "Follow me?"
[03:56:03.660 --> 03:56:05.180]   "And she's dead,"
[03:56:05.180 --> 03:56:07.180]   jail said calmly.
[03:56:07.180 --> 03:56:09.900]   He shuffled backwards,
[03:56:09.900 --> 03:56:11.180]   dragging Fiddly with him.
[03:56:11.180 --> 03:56:13.900]   She saw Makin appear from the crowd,
[03:56:13.900 --> 03:56:14.940]   their eyes touching.
[03:56:14.940 --> 03:56:17.660]   She did not appear scared,
[03:56:17.660 --> 03:56:18.700]   if anything,
[03:56:18.700 --> 03:56:19.420]   she looked angry.
[03:56:19.420 --> 03:56:22.220]   An emotion I know well.
[03:56:22.220 --> 03:56:26.540]   A warrior beside Makin took a step forward
[03:56:26.540 --> 03:56:27.580]   and jail moved,
[03:56:27.580 --> 03:56:30.220]   a line of blood trickled from the blade at Fiddly's throat.
[03:56:30.220 --> 03:56:33.660]   Makin grabbed a fistful of the warrior's shirt
[03:56:33.660 --> 03:56:34.460]   and held him still.
[03:56:34.460 --> 03:56:36.540]   "That's better,"
[03:56:36.540 --> 03:56:38.060]   jail said,
[03:56:38.060 --> 03:56:39.340]   a smile twitching his lips.
[03:56:39.340 --> 03:56:42.620]   How Makin hated that smile.
[03:56:42.620 --> 03:56:45.020]   "I'm going to walk away.
[03:56:45.020 --> 03:56:47.020]   I have no fear.
[03:56:47.020 --> 03:56:48.380]   I'm not a harmless lady.
[03:56:48.380 --> 03:56:49.900]   I know who she is,
[03:56:49.900 --> 03:56:51.100]   Fiddly of Tenabral.
[03:56:51.100 --> 03:56:53.420]   She will be safe with me,
[03:56:53.420 --> 03:56:54.780]   but she will stay with me.
[03:56:55.420 --> 03:56:57.260]   And if any of you should follow,"
[03:56:57.260 --> 03:57:00.060]   he prodded Fiddly in the ribs
[03:57:00.060 --> 03:57:01.420]   with his knife making her grimace.
[03:57:01.420 --> 03:57:03.980]   She was still staring at Makin.
[03:57:03.980 --> 03:57:07.420]   "Trust me," Makin mouthed,
[03:57:07.420 --> 03:57:09.260]   then stepped out from the crowd.
[03:57:09.260 --> 03:57:13.500]   The muscles in jail sawed arm tensed,
[03:57:13.500 --> 03:57:15.260]   then he recognized Makin and paused.
[03:57:15.260 --> 03:57:18.780]   "Not you again," jail sighed.
[03:57:18.780 --> 03:57:19.740]   "Don't you ever give up?"
[03:57:19.740 --> 03:57:22.460]   Makin took a pace forwards.
[03:57:23.580 --> 03:57:24.860]   "Do you wish to be responsible
[03:57:24.860 --> 03:57:26.140]   for the death of Fiddly,
[03:57:26.140 --> 03:57:27.740]   Lady of Tenabral?"
[03:57:27.740 --> 03:57:28.460]   jail snapped,
[03:57:28.460 --> 03:57:31.420]   resuming his slow shuffle back down the road.
[03:57:31.420 --> 03:57:35.260]   "Kill her," Makin growled,
[03:57:35.260 --> 03:57:37.820]   taking another step forwards focused on jail's eyes.
[03:57:37.820 --> 03:57:40.620]   "Stay back," jail said,
[03:57:40.620 --> 03:57:42.060]   his voice rising in pitch.
[03:57:42.060 --> 03:57:42.940]   "Or she dies."
[03:57:42.940 --> 03:57:45.420]   "Did you not hear me?"
[03:57:45.420 --> 03:57:46.620]   Makin said,
[03:57:46.620 --> 03:57:48.700]   taking another step.
[03:57:48.700 --> 03:57:49.260]   "Kill her.
[03:57:49.260 --> 03:57:51.260]   I care not.
[03:57:51.260 --> 03:57:54.220]   Either way, this is where you die.
[03:57:54.220 --> 03:57:57.020]   Nothing will change that now."
[03:57:57.020 --> 03:58:00.860]   He took another pace forwards and another,
[03:58:00.860 --> 03:58:02.060]   closing the gap between them.
[03:58:02.060 --> 03:58:05.580]   Jail stumbled backwards,
[03:58:05.580 --> 03:58:06.860]   dragging Fiddly with him.
[03:58:06.860 --> 03:58:08.460]   "Are you mad?"
[03:58:08.460 --> 03:58:11.340]   "She is the mother of Nithir.
[03:58:11.340 --> 03:58:13.500]   She is the first lady of Tenabral.
[03:58:13.500 --> 03:58:15.580]   Her warband is standing behind you.
[03:58:15.580 --> 03:58:18.140]   Harm her, and they will gut you."
[03:58:19.580 --> 03:58:20.380]   Makin shrugged.
[03:58:20.380 --> 03:58:24.140]   "Once you're dead, they can do what they like to me."
[03:58:24.140 --> 03:58:25.660]   "Stop!"
[03:58:25.660 --> 03:58:27.180]   Jail screeched,
[03:58:27.180 --> 03:58:28.300]   his knife hand pulling back.
[03:58:28.300 --> 03:58:29.900]   Makin stopped.
[03:58:29.900 --> 03:58:33.740]   "I have an offer for you," he said,
[03:58:33.740 --> 03:58:35.100]   as he slowly bent his knees,
[03:58:35.100 --> 03:58:36.620]   laid his sword and knife on the ground.
[03:58:36.620 --> 03:58:38.220]   "An offer?"
[03:58:38.220 --> 03:58:39.260]   "I."
[03:58:39.260 --> 03:58:43.260]   Makin reached over his shoulder and drew his other sword,
[03:58:43.260 --> 03:58:45.100]   laid that on the ground too,
[03:58:45.100 --> 03:58:47.260]   unsheathed a knife from his belt,
[03:58:47.260 --> 03:58:49.020]   another from a shoulder strap,
[03:58:49.020 --> 03:58:50.700]   one from the back of his boot,
[03:58:50.700 --> 03:58:52.460]   laying them all upon the ground.
[03:58:52.460 --> 03:58:54.620]   "Let her go.
[03:58:54.620 --> 03:58:57.740]   I'll fight you unarmed.
[03:58:57.740 --> 03:59:00.220]   Keep your sword and your knife."
[03:59:00.220 --> 03:59:03.740]   He stood straight and raised his hands,
[03:59:03.740 --> 03:59:05.180]   started walking forwards again.
[03:59:05.180 --> 03:59:06.700]   "You're insane!"
[03:59:06.700 --> 03:59:08.380]   Jail snorted.
[03:59:08.380 --> 03:59:11.580]   Eyes glancing from Makin to the pile of weapons on the ground.
[03:59:11.580 --> 03:59:14.460]   "Maybe," Makin shrugged.
[03:59:14.460 --> 03:59:17.740]   "You murdered my ward, my friend."
[03:59:18.940 --> 03:59:20.700]   Castel was as a son to me.
[03:59:20.700 --> 03:59:24.620]   "I will see you dead,
[03:59:24.620 --> 03:59:28.060]   even if I have to do it with my bare hands."
[03:59:28.060 --> 03:59:31.660]   He could see the indecision in Jail's eyes.
[03:59:31.660 --> 03:59:33.340]   The man was tempted.
[03:59:33.340 --> 03:59:34.780]   That was clear.
[03:59:34.780 --> 03:59:36.060]   And why not?
[03:59:36.060 --> 03:59:38.620]   He was a master with a sword,
[03:59:38.620 --> 03:59:39.580]   with any blade,
[03:59:39.580 --> 03:59:42.060]   and had both sword and knife in his hands
[03:59:42.060 --> 03:59:43.260]   against an unarmed man.
[03:59:43.260 --> 03:59:46.140]   "You've more knives hidden away?"
[03:59:46.140 --> 03:59:48.700]   "No," Makin shook his head.
[03:59:49.180 --> 03:59:50.780]   "You're just afraid to fight me."
[03:59:50.780 --> 03:59:54.380]   Jail snorted, but stopped his backward shuffling.
[03:59:54.380 --> 03:59:57.820]   "You're afraid," Makin said louder.
[03:59:57.820 --> 04:00:02.220]   "You," Jail, murderer and usurper,
[04:00:02.220 --> 04:00:04.140]   "a coward as well."
[04:00:04.140 --> 04:00:06.700]   A moment's pause.
[04:00:06.700 --> 04:00:08.700]   Jail's eyes narrowing.
[04:00:08.700 --> 04:00:12.380]   Then he was lifting his sword arm to club Fidele across the back of the head.
[04:00:12.380 --> 04:00:14.780]   In that breath,
[04:00:14.780 --> 04:00:17.740]   she stamped on his foot and drove an elbow into his ribs,
[04:00:17.740 --> 04:00:20.300]   spinning around and driving her knee into his groin.
[04:00:20.300 --> 04:00:23.660]   Jail's staggered and rocked backwards,
[04:00:23.660 --> 04:00:25.420]   and then Fidele was leaping away from him.
[04:00:25.420 --> 04:00:28.700]   "Bitch," Jail snarled,
[04:00:28.700 --> 04:00:30.060]   moving after her, but clumsily.
[04:00:30.060 --> 04:00:31.900]   In her heartbeat,
[04:00:31.900 --> 04:00:33.260]   Makin was standing in front of her.
[04:00:33.260 --> 04:00:37.260]   "Go," Makin breathed as he squeezed Fidele's hand.
[04:00:37.260 --> 04:00:41.820]   "Timly, he was aware of silence settling behind him."
[04:00:41.820 --> 04:00:45.340]   "Go," he said firmer,
[04:00:45.340 --> 04:00:48.140]   and heard her footsteps pad a dozen or so paces away.
[04:00:48.140 --> 04:00:52.940]   Jail paused, looking at Makin's empty hands.
[04:00:52.940 --> 04:00:57.180]   "You really don't have any more weapons," he said.
[04:00:57.180 --> 04:00:59.180]   Another smirk.
[04:00:59.180 --> 04:01:00.860]   "You actually are insane.
[04:01:00.860 --> 04:01:02.620]   I'm going to enjoy this."
[04:01:02.620 --> 04:01:06.940]   "Don't need my own blade," Makin said.
[04:01:06.940 --> 04:01:08.380]   "I'll just take one of yours."
[04:01:08.380 --> 04:01:11.500]   He strode forwards,
[04:01:11.500 --> 04:01:14.380]   swayed away from Jail's diagonally chopping sword,
[04:01:14.380 --> 04:01:16.700]   pirated past a stab of Jail's knife,
[04:01:16.700 --> 04:01:19.340]   stepped in close and punched Jail in the ribs,
[04:01:19.340 --> 04:01:20.780]   making him cry out.
[04:01:20.780 --> 04:01:23.580]   Another punch to the sword cut on Jail's leg,
[04:01:23.580 --> 04:01:24.940]   elicited a grunt of pain.
[04:01:24.940 --> 04:01:30.460]   "For Castell," Makin said, close to Jail's ear.
[04:01:30.460 --> 04:01:32.060]   Then he was spinning away.
[04:01:32.060 --> 04:01:36.620]   Jail cursed, visibly mastered his pain,
[04:01:36.620 --> 04:01:39.740]   set his stance and came at Makin carefully.
[04:01:39.740 --> 04:01:41.420]   Sword held high, knife low.
[04:01:43.100 --> 04:01:44.780]   Makin stepped in to meet Jail,
[04:01:44.780 --> 04:01:48.140]   palm of his hand slapping the blade of Jail's sword away
[04:01:48.140 --> 04:01:49.740]   as he attempted a straight lunge,
[04:01:49.740 --> 04:01:51.420]   grabbed Jail's knife wrist
[04:01:51.420 --> 04:01:54.140]   and head butted the man full on the bridge of his nose.
[04:01:54.140 --> 04:01:57.900]   Jail spluttered, blood gushing,
[04:01:57.900 --> 04:01:59.100]   Makin shoving him back.
[04:01:59.100 --> 04:02:02.700]   "For Castell," Makin growled.
[04:02:02.700 --> 04:02:05.820]   Jail spat,
[04:02:05.820 --> 04:02:07.260]   cuffed blood from his face,
[04:02:07.260 --> 04:02:09.180]   danced forwards, swinging his sword.
[04:02:09.180 --> 04:02:12.460]   Makin ducked, air whistling over his head.
[04:02:12.460 --> 04:02:15.420]   He twisted, felt a hot pain lance along his ribs.
[04:02:15.420 --> 04:02:16.940]   Heard shouting behind him,
[04:02:16.940 --> 04:02:18.780]   punched Jail on his injured leg again
[04:02:18.780 --> 04:02:20.300]   as he spun out of range,
[04:02:20.300 --> 04:02:21.740]   heard another cry of pain.
[04:02:21.740 --> 04:02:24.620]   "For Castell," he breathed.
[04:02:24.620 --> 04:02:28.540]   Jail looked at a red line that his knife had scored
[04:02:28.540 --> 04:02:29.980]   through the leather of Makin's jerking.
[04:02:29.980 --> 04:02:32.540]   "Blee'd, like the rest of us then."
[04:02:32.540 --> 04:02:36.380]   Makin ignored him and darted forwards,
[04:02:36.380 --> 04:02:38.140]   weaved past a sword thrust,
[04:02:38.140 --> 04:02:39.580]   kicked out at Jail's ankle,
[04:02:39.580 --> 04:02:42.380]   connecting, hand chopping at Jail's throat,
[04:02:42.380 --> 04:02:44.060]   grabbing his knife hand and twisting.
[04:02:44.060 --> 04:02:47.100]   Jail squawked in pain,
[04:02:47.100 --> 04:02:48.940]   his knife clattering to the road,
[04:02:48.940 --> 04:02:51.500]   Makin kicking it away and darting out of range.
[04:02:51.500 --> 04:02:55.260]   "For Castell," he said,
[04:02:55.260 --> 04:02:56.780]   as he spun away again.
[04:02:56.780 --> 04:02:59.420]   "Stop saying that," Jail yelled at him,
[04:02:59.420 --> 04:03:02.220]   spittle flying, then ran at him more of a hobble.
[04:03:02.220 --> 04:03:06.620]   Makin stooped to sweep up the fallen knife,
[04:03:06.620 --> 04:03:08.380]   twisting away from Jail's sword,
[04:03:08.380 --> 04:03:09.900]   slashed once with the knife.
[04:03:10.780 --> 04:03:13.260]   Jail cried out with pain as he stumbled on,
[04:03:13.260 --> 04:03:14.220]   almost falling.
[04:03:14.220 --> 04:03:17.260]   He regained his balance and backed away from Makin,
[04:03:17.260 --> 04:03:19.580]   limping as blood ran down the back of his leg.
[04:03:19.580 --> 04:03:22.780]   Makin strode at him for the first time,
[04:03:22.780 --> 04:03:24.540]   seeing fear in Jail's eyes.
[04:03:24.540 --> 04:03:26.860]   "Do you remember?"
[04:03:26.860 --> 04:03:30.540]   "In the tomb," Beneth held his.
[04:03:30.540 --> 04:03:32.540]   Makin said, not breaking his stride.
[04:03:32.540 --> 04:03:35.500]   "It was a fair fight," Jail said, pleading,
[04:03:35.500 --> 04:03:37.980]   shuffling away, leaving a trail of blood from his wounded leg.
[04:03:39.020 --> 04:03:42.460]   "He was your kin, and you betrayed him.
[04:03:42.460 --> 04:03:46.700]   You murdered him," Makin said, exploding into movement,
[04:03:46.700 --> 04:03:49.980]   leaping forwards, dancing to the side around Jail's sword,
[04:03:49.980 --> 04:03:53.660]   a slice at Jail's arm, a yell, and the sword was falling.
[04:03:53.660 --> 04:03:57.180]   They crashed into each other, limbs tangled,
[04:03:57.180 --> 04:03:58.620]   fell to the ground, rolled,
[04:03:58.620 --> 04:04:00.540]   Jail finding new strength as he punched,
[04:04:00.540 --> 04:04:02.220]   kicked, and bit at Makin.
[04:04:02.220 --> 04:04:05.580]   Makin grabbed one of Jail's arms,
[04:04:05.580 --> 04:04:07.340]   pinned it as they rolled together,
[04:04:07.340 --> 04:04:10.060]   inched his knife blade up towards Jail's throat.
[04:04:10.060 --> 04:04:12.540]   Jail's efforts redoubled.
[04:04:12.540 --> 04:04:15.740]   His free fist punching at Makin's head,
[04:04:15.740 --> 04:04:17.980]   his guts, anywhere, everywhere.
[04:04:17.980 --> 04:04:20.940]   Makin grunted but did not let go.
[04:04:20.940 --> 04:04:23.900]   Jail was grabbing at Makin's wrist
[04:04:23.900 --> 04:04:26.300]   and able to stop it moving remorselessly upwards.
[04:04:26.300 --> 04:04:28.700]   They rolled to a halt.
[04:04:28.700 --> 04:04:32.540]   Makin squeezed, twisted, and Jail's pinned arm cracked.
[04:04:32.540 --> 04:04:37.020]   Jail screamed high and long as a stuck bore.
[04:04:37.020 --> 04:04:38.620]   The fight draining from him.
[04:04:38.620 --> 04:04:41.820]   Then Makin's knife was at Jail's throat,
[04:04:41.820 --> 04:04:44.700]   tip pressing into the soft flesh at the base of the jaw.
[04:04:44.700 --> 04:04:47.180]   "Please," Jail sobbed.
[04:04:47.180 --> 04:04:50.940]   "For Castell," Makin whispered.
[04:04:50.940 --> 04:04:54.460]   Then he shoved the blade up with all his strength.
[04:04:54.460 --> 04:04:58.060]   Jail made a choking sound,
[04:04:58.060 --> 04:05:01.740]   gurgling on dark blood that welded from his mouth dribbled down his chin.
[04:05:01.740 --> 04:05:05.420]   He struggled, but Makin pushed the blade deeper,
[04:05:05.420 --> 04:05:06.940]   on into his skull,
[04:05:06.940 --> 04:05:10.620]   kept pushing until the knife's hilt was tight to Jail's flesh.
[04:05:10.620 --> 04:05:14.700]   Jail's eyes bulged, then he spasmed,
[04:05:14.700 --> 04:05:15.980]   legs kicking slowed.
[04:05:15.980 --> 04:05:17.420]   Became still.
[04:05:17.420 --> 04:05:19.900]   Makin roamed away.
[04:05:19.900 --> 04:05:22.540]   Slowly stood and looked down upon Jail.
[04:05:22.540 --> 04:05:24.300]   He grimaced.
[04:05:24.300 --> 04:05:28.540]   Part snarl felt suddenly weak and dropped to his knees,
[04:05:28.540 --> 04:05:30.620]   then sat and stared at Jail's corpse.
[04:05:30.620 --> 04:05:33.820]   "You are avenged, Castell."
[04:05:35.020 --> 04:05:36.540]   "You who were like a son to me."
[04:05:36.540 --> 04:05:39.980]   He felt his shoulders begin to shake,
[04:05:39.980 --> 04:05:41.900]   tears blur his vision,
[04:05:41.900 --> 04:05:44.620]   and then a hand was stroking his head,
[04:05:44.620 --> 04:05:45.820]   a warm body beside him,
[04:05:45.820 --> 04:05:46.940]   pulling him into an embrace.
[04:05:46.940 --> 04:05:51.180]   He laid his head upon Fidele's breast and wept.
[04:05:51.180 --> 04:05:54.620]   He didn't know how long he remained like that,
[04:05:54.620 --> 04:05:55.740]   but in time,
[04:05:55.740 --> 04:05:58.780]   the world opened up from that small pin point of grief,
[04:05:58.780 --> 04:06:00.060]   and he became aware of voices.
[04:06:00.060 --> 04:06:03.580]   He looked up and saw the war band of Ripper
[04:06:03.580 --> 04:06:05.420]   gathered in a half-circle about him.
[04:06:05.420 --> 04:06:06.140]   There it is.
[04:06:06.140 --> 04:06:08.060]   Krelis, Albin, Alcyon,
[04:06:08.060 --> 04:06:10.060]   and so many others, hundreds of them,
[04:06:10.060 --> 04:06:11.420]   were watching him.
[04:06:11.420 --> 04:06:17.100]   "Well, that was a cracking fire and no denying,"
[04:06:17.100 --> 04:06:19.340]   Krelis said, nodding to Makin,
[04:06:19.340 --> 04:06:21.980]   lifting a skin of mead to his lips and drinking deep.
[04:06:21.980 --> 04:06:23.500]   "What now?"
[04:06:23.500 --> 04:06:26.220]   Fidele answered.
[04:06:26.220 --> 04:06:29.180]   "Now we march on Drassil."
[04:06:33.180 --> 04:06:33.980]   Chapter 18
[04:06:33.980 --> 04:06:35.820]   Cohen
[04:06:35.820 --> 04:06:40.300]   Cohen stood in the great courtyard
[04:06:40.300 --> 04:06:41.900]   before the gates of Drassil,
[04:06:41.900 --> 04:06:43.340]   alongside her fellow prisoners.
[04:06:43.340 --> 04:06:46.540]   Calidus walked down the staircase
[04:06:46.540 --> 04:06:47.580]   that led to the battlements,
[04:06:47.580 --> 04:06:49.660]   where he had announced his challenge to Corbin
[04:06:49.660 --> 04:06:51.340]   as he did each and every morning.
[04:06:51.340 --> 04:06:54.620]   "Save the lives of your people.
[04:06:54.620 --> 04:06:56.540]   Stop their torture."
[04:06:56.540 --> 04:07:00.700]   As always, Corbin did not come,
[04:07:00.700 --> 04:07:03.900]   and now Calidus began the second half of each day's ritual,
[04:07:03.900 --> 04:07:08.220]   choosing a prisoner to be impaled within the courtyard.
[04:07:08.220 --> 04:07:12.620]   Almost a moon had passed since Drassil had fallen
[04:07:12.620 --> 04:07:14.300]   so unimaginably quickly,
[04:07:14.300 --> 04:07:17.420]   a moon of heartache and pain.
[04:07:17.420 --> 04:07:20.380]   Although she was a prisoner,
[04:07:20.380 --> 04:07:23.900]   Cohen had been allowed to take charge of the makeshift hospice
[04:07:23.900 --> 04:07:27.020]   that she and Brin had spent so long stocking and preparing,
[04:07:27.020 --> 04:07:28.700]   choosing a few staff to help her
[04:07:28.700 --> 04:07:30.540]   from amongst the more able-bodied prisoners.
[04:07:30.540 --> 04:07:33.500]   She was permitted to heal the captured,
[04:07:33.500 --> 04:07:35.260]   only if she also looked after those
[04:07:35.260 --> 04:07:37.580]   in the fair's army who had been wounded in the battle.
[04:07:37.580 --> 04:07:41.500]   Much as Cohen despised doing so,
[04:07:41.500 --> 04:07:44.860]   she knew it was the only way to help her own people.
[04:07:44.860 --> 04:07:49.260]   Calidus stopped a dozen steps up from the courtyard
[04:07:49.260 --> 04:07:50.700]   and looked at the gathered prisoners.
[04:07:50.700 --> 04:07:54.220]   "It seems that your bright star
[04:07:54.220 --> 04:07:57.740]   has better things to do than save your lives," he said.
[04:07:58.460 --> 04:07:59.580]   Voice laced with anger.
[04:07:59.580 --> 04:08:02.140]   Cohen shivered involuntarily
[04:08:02.140 --> 04:08:03.900]   at the thought of what was the calm of the screams.
[04:08:03.900 --> 04:08:07.260]   She was no stranger to death now,
[04:08:07.260 --> 04:08:09.340]   but nothing could make her immune
[04:08:09.340 --> 04:08:11.100]   to the horror she witnessed each morning.
[04:08:11.100 --> 04:08:14.540]   Corbin, come and save us.
[04:08:14.540 --> 04:08:18.700]   With each passing day, it seemed more impossible.
[04:08:18.700 --> 04:08:21.180]   For the first few days,
[04:08:21.180 --> 04:08:22.380]   she had been practically convinced
[04:08:22.380 --> 04:08:24.620]   that her brother would somehow return with a war band
[04:08:24.620 --> 04:08:26.860]   and a win-back Drassil defeats their enemy.
[04:08:28.140 --> 04:08:30.620]   But with each scream filled morning,
[04:08:30.620 --> 04:08:31.580]   that hope had withered.
[04:08:31.580 --> 04:08:35.340]   Calidus gave a curt nod,
[04:08:35.340 --> 04:08:37.340]   and a catishim stepped out from the shadows
[04:08:37.340 --> 04:08:38.220]   of the stable blocks,
[04:08:38.220 --> 04:08:39.420]   moving amongst the prisoners,
[04:08:39.420 --> 04:08:40.700]   dragging one forwards.
[04:08:40.700 --> 04:08:44.780]   As always, Cohen's heart seemed to freeze,
[04:08:44.780 --> 04:08:47.500]   feeling as if it swelled to fill her chest
[04:08:47.500 --> 04:08:49.340]   as a single catishim walked down the line
[04:08:49.340 --> 04:08:50.220]   that she was standing in.
[04:08:50.220 --> 04:08:53.900]   It was the figure that was always surrounded
[04:08:53.900 --> 04:08:55.900]   by billowing clouds of flies.
[04:08:57.660 --> 04:08:58.620]   It paused before her,
[04:08:58.620 --> 04:09:01.100]   one fist grabbing her chin
[04:09:01.100 --> 04:09:02.780]   and lifting it to stare into her eyes.
[04:09:02.780 --> 04:09:04.060]   Though there was nothing there,
[04:09:04.060 --> 04:09:05.980]   its eyes were black, soulless wells.
[04:09:05.980 --> 04:09:08.780]   A lunatic grin
[04:09:08.780 --> 04:09:10.460]   twisted its mouth in a black tongue,
[04:09:10.460 --> 04:09:12.060]   flicked out from its mouth,
[04:09:12.060 --> 04:09:13.580]   thick and swollen,
[04:09:13.580 --> 04:09:15.340]   and slowly licked her cheek.
[04:09:15.340 --> 04:09:18.620]   She wretched from its foul breath,
[04:09:18.620 --> 04:09:20.780]   but the calidusim held her immovable,
[04:09:20.780 --> 04:09:23.660]   while flies crawled over her face up her nose.
[04:09:25.660 --> 04:09:29.580]   "One day, soon," it whispered in her ear,
[04:09:29.580 --> 04:09:32.620]   "I will crush your skull
[04:09:32.620 --> 04:09:36.540]   and suck the jelly from your eyes."
[04:09:36.540 --> 04:09:39.580]   Then it released her,
[04:09:39.580 --> 04:09:41.820]   grabbing the man beside her,
[04:09:41.820 --> 04:09:43.180]   one of those who had been saved
[04:09:43.180 --> 04:09:44.860]   from the Vinthalen orebenches
[04:09:44.860 --> 04:09:46.540]   and dragged him towards a stake.
[04:09:46.540 --> 04:09:49.020]   He began to plead, then wail.
[04:09:49.020 --> 04:09:51.260]   It did no good.
[04:09:51.260 --> 04:09:53.900]   And soon his horrific screams
[04:09:53.900 --> 04:09:56.300]   were wringing out a cacophony of torment.
[04:09:56.300 --> 04:09:59.100]   There was no hiding from it.
[04:09:59.100 --> 04:10:01.980]   The sound climbed,
[04:10:01.980 --> 04:10:03.820]   sweeping over the walls
[04:10:03.820 --> 04:10:04.780]   and on,
[04:10:04.780 --> 04:10:06.060]   out over the plains
[04:10:06.060 --> 04:10:07.100]   surrounding the fortress
[04:10:07.100 --> 04:10:08.940]   into the silent trees of fawn.
[04:10:08.940 --> 04:10:12.380]   Have Corbin and the survivors fled,
[04:10:12.380 --> 04:10:13.740]   or retreated?
[04:10:13.740 --> 04:10:17.420]   Calidus strode down from the battlement steps
[04:10:17.420 --> 04:10:19.420]   and with an irritable wave of his hand
[04:10:19.420 --> 04:10:21.100]   signaled for the surviving prisoners
[04:10:21.100 --> 04:10:21.820]   to be taken away.
[04:10:22.940 --> 04:10:24.380]   The warriors of Tana Braille
[04:10:24.380 --> 04:10:25.580]   in black and silver
[04:10:25.580 --> 04:10:26.700]   herded Cohen and the others
[04:10:26.700 --> 04:10:27.500]   out of the courtyard.
[04:10:27.500 --> 04:10:29.980]   She wrinkled her nose
[04:10:29.980 --> 04:10:31.180]   as they passed the stables,
[04:10:31.180 --> 04:10:32.780]   the stench of Nefair's drag,
[04:10:32.780 --> 04:10:33.820]   clawing up her nose.
[04:10:33.820 --> 04:10:36.780]   She'd smelt a lot of bad things
[04:10:36.780 --> 04:10:37.340]   in her time,
[04:10:37.340 --> 04:10:39.420]   but nothing like the smell of drag dung.
[04:10:39.420 --> 04:10:42.220]   She heard a horse nay
[04:10:42.220 --> 04:10:43.660]   as they moved past the stables.
[04:10:43.660 --> 04:10:45.660]   Shield.
[04:10:45.660 --> 04:10:48.460]   When Drassil had fallen
[04:10:48.460 --> 04:10:50.540]   to Calidus and Nefair's warband,
[04:10:50.540 --> 04:10:52.540]   the stables had been full of horses,
[04:10:52.540 --> 04:10:54.860]   great war horses that the Jihar rode,
[04:10:54.860 --> 04:10:56.460]   a whole herd that had been saved
[04:10:56.460 --> 04:10:57.900]   from the destruction of Graham's hold.
[04:10:57.900 --> 04:11:00.300]   They were still there
[04:11:00.300 --> 04:11:02.140]   and created another task
[04:11:02.140 --> 04:11:03.740]   that the prisoners were used for,
[04:11:03.740 --> 04:11:04.540]   stable duty,
[04:11:04.540 --> 04:11:06.060]   tending to the horses.
[04:11:06.060 --> 04:11:09.340]   Every time that Cohen was picked,
[04:11:09.340 --> 04:11:10.140]   she had managed to get
[04:11:10.140 --> 04:11:11.820]   close to shield Corbin's stallion.
[04:11:11.820 --> 04:11:14.620]   As they left the courtyard
[04:11:14.620 --> 04:11:16.300]   and entered a wide street,
[04:11:16.300 --> 04:11:17.980]   shouts rang out from the wall,
[04:11:17.980 --> 04:11:19.180]   then horns sounded.
[04:11:20.940 --> 04:11:23.420]   The great bars across the gates were drawn back
[04:11:23.420 --> 04:11:24.380]   and the gates opened
[04:11:24.380 --> 04:11:25.420]   with a juddering creek.
[04:11:25.420 --> 04:11:29.500]   Figures filled the open gates,
[04:11:29.500 --> 04:11:31.100]   silhouettes with the sun behind them.
[04:11:31.100 --> 04:11:33.340]   They became clearer
[04:11:33.340 --> 04:11:34.860]   as they spilt into the courtyard.
[04:11:34.860 --> 04:11:37.740]   Vintthallen, a score, two score,
[04:11:37.740 --> 04:11:38.700]   maybe more,
[04:11:38.700 --> 04:11:39.660]   many of them were wounded.
[04:11:39.660 --> 04:11:43.580]   So something is out there then,
[04:11:43.580 --> 04:11:46.220]   hidden within the trees of form,
[04:11:46.220 --> 04:11:48.380]   something with teeth of iron.
[04:11:50.300 --> 04:11:52.060]   As she was marched away from the courtyard,
[04:11:52.060 --> 04:11:53.980]   Cohen felt a seed of hope glimmer,
[04:11:53.980 --> 04:11:54.620]   deep inside.
[04:11:54.620 --> 04:11:57.420]   It was faints and fragile,
[04:11:57.420 --> 04:11:59.180]   and it wasn't helped much
[04:11:59.180 --> 04:12:00.380]   by what she saw around her
[04:12:00.380 --> 04:12:01.580]   on her way back to the hospice.
[04:12:01.580 --> 04:12:05.020]   Cadishing were prowling the streets,
[04:12:05.020 --> 04:12:06.060]   moving like shadows,
[04:12:06.060 --> 04:12:07.900]   their heads twitching at every sound.
[04:12:07.900 --> 04:12:10.300]   All around her,
[04:12:10.300 --> 04:12:11.660]   she saw a host of eagle guard
[04:12:11.660 --> 04:12:12.700]   in their black and silver,
[04:12:12.700 --> 04:12:14.220]   manning gates and walls,
[04:12:14.220 --> 04:12:15.820]   filling once abandoned buildings,
[04:12:15.820 --> 04:12:17.500]   working at forge and barn,
[04:12:17.500 --> 04:12:19.180]   and the Vintthallen were everywhere.
[04:12:19.740 --> 04:12:22.780]   Many of them were half drunk and fighting,
[04:12:22.780 --> 04:12:24.060]   loitering on street corners,
[04:12:24.060 --> 04:12:25.420]   sitting in impromptu circles
[04:12:25.420 --> 04:12:26.700]   and throwing dice of bone.
[04:12:26.700 --> 04:12:30.380]   The numbers of her enemy seemed vast,
[04:12:30.380 --> 04:12:33.100]   far more than Corbin's war-bound had ever been,
[04:12:33.100 --> 04:12:33.980]   even at full strength.
[04:12:33.980 --> 04:12:36.540]   Could we ever have won?
[04:12:36.540 --> 04:12:39.420]   The dead from the battle
[04:12:39.420 --> 04:12:41.420]   had mostly been cleared from the streets now,
[04:12:41.420 --> 04:12:42.620]   here and there,
[04:12:42.620 --> 04:12:44.380]   a dark stain on a flagstone,
[04:12:44.380 --> 04:12:45.740]   acting as a stark reminder.
[04:12:47.340 --> 04:12:48.780]   As Cohen turned a corner,
[04:12:48.780 --> 04:12:51.900]   she saw a dog sniffing at a heap to rubbish pile.
[04:12:51.900 --> 04:12:54.380]   The dog was small and white,
[04:12:54.380 --> 04:12:55.660]   a ratter.
[04:12:55.660 --> 04:12:57.820]   I know that dog.
[04:12:57.820 --> 04:12:59.820]   It was Halen's.
[04:12:59.820 --> 04:13:01.980]   What happened to him?
[04:13:01.980 --> 04:13:05.740]   She looked at the dog as she was marched past it,
[04:13:05.740 --> 04:13:07.420]   it was skinny and half-starved,
[04:13:07.420 --> 04:13:08.220]   ribs visible.
[04:13:08.220 --> 04:13:10.220]   Halen must be dead,
[04:13:10.220 --> 04:13:11.900]   he loved that dog,
[04:13:11.900 --> 04:13:12.780]   pots he called him.
[04:13:12.780 --> 04:13:16.060]   Just like my poor Budai,
[04:13:17.020 --> 04:13:18.300]   what happened to him?
[04:13:18.300 --> 04:13:21.180]   She had not seen him since before the battle,
[04:13:21.180 --> 04:13:23.500]   perhaps he had been killed,
[04:13:23.500 --> 04:13:24.780]   or maybe fled,
[04:13:24.780 --> 04:13:27.020]   though deep in her heart she doubted that.
[04:13:27.020 --> 04:13:29.500]   He was too loyal,
[04:13:29.500 --> 04:13:30.860]   would not have left me like that.
[04:13:30.860 --> 04:13:33.980]   She drew level with the white dog
[04:13:33.980 --> 04:13:35.340]   and clicked her tongue,
[04:13:35.340 --> 04:13:37.100]   reached inside a pocket in her cloak
[04:13:37.100 --> 04:13:38.460]   and pulled out a chunk of bread.
[04:13:38.460 --> 04:13:41.900]   The dog lifted its head sniffing,
[04:13:41.900 --> 04:13:44.700]   and after a moment's cautious indecision,
[04:13:44.700 --> 04:13:45.580]   darted over to her.
[04:13:45.580 --> 04:13:48.540]   She dropped the piece of bread
[04:13:48.540 --> 04:13:50.060]   and it caught it deftly,
[04:13:50.060 --> 04:13:50.700]   and it was gone.
[04:13:50.700 --> 04:13:53.660]   She watched it scamper away,
[04:13:53.660 --> 04:13:54.860]   turn a corner and disappear.
[04:13:54.860 --> 04:13:57.180]   For a moment,
[04:13:57.180 --> 04:13:59.020]   she thought she saw something waiting for it,
[04:13:59.020 --> 04:13:59.980]   moving in the shadows.
[04:13:59.980 --> 04:14:03.340]   Guards ushered her
[04:14:03.340 --> 04:14:05.660]   and the other prisoners into the hospice,
[04:14:05.660 --> 04:14:06.940]   less than 300 of them now,
[04:14:06.940 --> 04:14:08.460]   because of Caledus' mourning ritual.
[04:14:08.460 --> 04:14:11.260]   The building was large enough
[04:14:11.260 --> 04:14:12.300]   to accommodate their numbers
[04:14:12.300 --> 04:14:13.660]   with a lower floor made of two
[04:14:13.660 --> 04:14:14.860]   interlinking chambers.
[04:14:14.860 --> 04:14:18.380]   Part of it had been partitioned off
[04:14:18.380 --> 04:14:19.740]   for the care of the injured.
[04:14:19.740 --> 04:14:22.060]   The rest turned into a makeshift prison for the others.
[04:14:22.060 --> 04:14:25.260]   Only one guard came into the hospice,
[04:14:25.260 --> 04:14:26.940]   the rest sitting out in the courtyard.
[04:14:26.940 --> 04:14:30.060]   Cohen heard the sound of dice on a throwboard.
[04:14:30.060 --> 04:14:34.700]   Automatically, she went into the adjoining chamber
[04:14:34.700 --> 04:14:35.820]   and checked on the injured,
[04:14:35.820 --> 04:14:37.100]   not many of them left now.
[04:14:37.100 --> 04:14:39.900]   There had been a lot more after the battle,
[04:14:39.900 --> 04:14:41.340]   but many had died.
[04:14:41.340 --> 04:14:42.540]   Cohen being unable to do
[04:14:42.540 --> 04:14:43.580]   little more for them than ease
[04:14:43.580 --> 04:14:45.340]   they're passing across the bridge of swords.
[04:14:45.340 --> 04:14:49.260]   Now only a score remained in here,
[04:14:49.260 --> 04:14:51.340]   although from what she'd just seen,
[04:14:51.340 --> 04:14:52.860]   she expected that her skill
[04:14:52.860 --> 04:14:55.020]   would now be required for the injured of Inthallen.
[04:14:55.020 --> 04:14:58.860]   Frankly, she'd rather poison them than heal them.
[04:14:58.860 --> 04:15:02.300]   "Do not give up," she told herself,
[04:15:02.300 --> 04:15:04.460]   remembering her time as a prisoner
[04:15:04.460 --> 04:15:05.580]   with Nefair and Caledus.
[04:15:05.580 --> 04:15:08.380]   All had seemed hopeless then.
[04:15:08.380 --> 04:15:10.700]   That time,
[04:15:10.700 --> 04:15:12.780]   Corbin had come out of nowhere and rescued her.
[04:15:12.780 --> 04:15:15.740]   Although ma'am died in the undertaking.
[04:15:15.740 --> 04:15:18.300]   I'll not let that happen again,
[04:15:18.300 --> 04:15:19.580]   people dying for my saving,
[04:15:19.580 --> 04:15:21.100]   I'll not wait around to be rescued,
[04:15:21.100 --> 04:15:23.180]   I will make my own fortune,
[04:15:23.180 --> 04:15:23.980]   whatever the cost.
[04:15:23.980 --> 04:15:27.580]   Cohen opened her eyes.
[04:15:27.580 --> 04:15:30.780]   After counting a hundred heartbeats
[04:15:30.780 --> 04:15:31.820]   and not hearing anything else,
[04:15:31.820 --> 04:15:32.940]   but the usual snoring,
[04:15:32.940 --> 04:15:36.060]   she turned her head to check on the Inthallen guard.
[04:15:36.060 --> 04:15:39.260]   As expected, he was asleep.
[04:15:39.900 --> 04:15:43.660]   "Beyond the door," she heard the muted sound of conversation,
[04:15:43.660 --> 04:15:45.100]   the occasional burst of laughter,
[04:15:45.100 --> 04:15:46.700]   the rest of their guards
[04:15:46.700 --> 04:15:48.540]   sitting in the courtyard drinking and gambling.
[04:15:48.540 --> 04:15:50.700]   At first,
[04:15:50.700 --> 04:15:53.020]   their guards had been vigilant,
[04:15:53.020 --> 04:15:54.380]   and rightly so,
[04:15:54.380 --> 04:15:57.340]   because there had been a smattering of Jihar amongst the captives,
[04:15:57.340 --> 04:15:59.420]   and they did not take well to being made prisoners.
[04:15:59.420 --> 04:16:01.660]   On the first night,
[04:16:01.660 --> 04:16:02.940]   two had attempted escape,
[04:16:02.940 --> 04:16:04.220]   killing eight guards,
[04:16:04.220 --> 04:16:06.540]   maiming three more and setting fire to another.
[04:16:08.140 --> 04:16:10.380]   Eventually, they had both been subdued
[04:16:10.380 --> 04:16:12.700]   and executed in a courtyard the next day.
[04:16:12.700 --> 04:16:15.100]   Since then,
[04:16:15.100 --> 04:16:16.860]   no more escapes had been attempted,
[04:16:16.860 --> 04:16:17.820]   and over time,
[04:16:17.820 --> 04:16:20.300]   the guards had become correspondingly less vigilant.
[04:16:20.300 --> 04:16:24.140]   Cohen patted slowly from the room,
[04:16:24.140 --> 04:16:25.900]   making her way to a set of stairs,
[04:16:25.900 --> 04:16:27.020]   leading up to a balcony
[04:16:27.020 --> 04:16:28.780]   that looked down upon the main hall,
[04:16:28.780 --> 04:16:30.540]   with a dozen rooms opening off it.
[04:16:30.540 --> 04:16:33.100]   Almost silently,
[04:16:33.100 --> 04:16:34.700]   she passed into one of those rooms.
[04:16:36.060 --> 04:16:39.820]   There was one large window that let in a wide beam of moonlight,
[04:16:39.820 --> 04:16:41.340]   shockingly bright in the darkness.
[04:16:41.340 --> 04:16:44.860]   Cohen traced a familiar path to a cupboard,
[04:16:44.860 --> 04:16:45.900]   opened the door,
[04:16:45.900 --> 04:16:47.820]   shifted a loose board inside,
[04:16:47.820 --> 04:16:48.860]   and lifted out a package.
[04:16:48.860 --> 04:16:51.980]   She shuffled over to the window,
[04:16:51.980 --> 04:16:54.060]   sat with her back to the wall,
[04:16:54.060 --> 04:16:56.380]   facing the dark silhouette of the open doorway.
[04:16:56.380 --> 04:17:01.180]   She opened the old linen she'd wrapped round it to reveal a book,
[04:17:01.180 --> 04:17:02.140]   leather-bound and worn.
[04:17:03.820 --> 04:17:05.180]   She opened it towards the back,
[04:17:05.180 --> 04:17:07.500]   and started reading the spidery script.
[04:17:07.500 --> 04:17:09.580]   Wurud?
[04:17:09.580 --> 04:17:10.780]   Eigen?
[04:17:10.780 --> 04:17:12.300]   Lo?
[04:17:12.300 --> 04:17:12.780]   Hara?
[04:17:12.780 --> 04:17:13.260]   Agada?
[04:17:13.260 --> 04:17:15.740]   A guarding spell?
[04:17:15.740 --> 04:17:18.540]   A kachiran tell?
[04:17:18.540 --> 04:17:20.700]   Boiling water?
[04:17:20.700 --> 04:17:22.220]   Worm root?
[04:17:22.220 --> 04:17:23.820]   Flade skin?
[04:17:23.820 --> 04:17:26.300]   She paused there,
[04:17:26.300 --> 04:17:28.940]   a shiver goose bumping her flesh.
[04:17:28.940 --> 04:17:32.380]   What did I expect from a book of giant spells?
[04:17:33.500 --> 04:17:35.340]   She pulled her face, fear, and revulsion.
[04:17:35.340 --> 04:17:38.860]   It depends either skin belonged to, I suppose.
[04:17:38.860 --> 04:17:41.100]   If it came from Caledus or Nefair or Lycus,
[04:17:41.100 --> 04:17:42.060]   more count or Rin,
[04:17:42.060 --> 04:17:45.660]   the list grew in her mind of enemies
[04:17:45.660 --> 04:17:47.100]   she'd like to do terrible things to.
[04:17:47.100 --> 04:17:52.060]   Brina said it is a tool not an evil of itself.
[04:17:52.060 --> 04:17:55.180]   It is how I use it that's important.
[04:17:55.180 --> 04:17:58.140]   She became aware of a sound,
[04:17:58.140 --> 04:18:01.020]   a soft snuffling from out of the window,
[04:18:01.580 --> 04:18:02.380]   leaves rustled.
[04:18:02.380 --> 04:18:05.180]   Something in a herb beds.
[04:18:05.180 --> 04:18:09.180]   Slowly, as quietly as she could manage,
[04:18:09.180 --> 04:18:11.900]   she peered up over the window's edge and looked out.
[04:18:11.900 --> 04:18:15.580]   Something was moving through the herb garden,
[04:18:15.580 --> 04:18:16.780]   nose to the ground,
[04:18:16.780 --> 04:18:18.380]   moving steadily towards the hospice.
[04:18:18.380 --> 04:18:20.540]   It paused,
[04:18:20.540 --> 04:18:22.380]   its white form reflecting moonlight,
[04:18:22.380 --> 04:18:23.820]   and looked up at Cohen.
[04:18:23.820 --> 04:18:26.940]   It's the dog from earlier,
[04:18:26.940 --> 04:18:27.660]   Halen's ratter.
[04:18:29.340 --> 04:18:32.140]   The dog turned in a circle and jumped on the spot.
[04:18:32.140 --> 04:18:35.020]   Cohen was scared they would start barking.
[04:18:35.020 --> 04:18:38.780]   Then, movement caught her eye,
[04:18:38.780 --> 04:18:42.380]   further back in a shadowed recess on the far side of the herb garden,
[04:18:42.380 --> 04:18:44.460]   a solid patch in the darkness.
[04:18:44.460 --> 04:18:47.820]   It whined, moved into the moonlight.
[04:18:47.820 --> 04:18:50.700]   Cohen's breath caught in her chest.
[04:18:50.700 --> 04:18:52.300]   Boodai.
[04:18:52.300 --> 04:18:55.100]   Without thinking,
[04:18:55.100 --> 04:18:56.780]   she jumped from the window,
[04:18:56.780 --> 04:18:58.780]   dropping into the soft earth of the herb bed.
[04:18:59.420 --> 04:19:01.420]   Before she had righted herself,
[04:19:01.420 --> 04:19:03.500]   Boodai was bounding across the soft earth,
[04:19:03.500 --> 04:19:05.180]   hurling himself against her rough tongue,
[04:19:05.180 --> 04:19:06.540]   licking her face, whining.
[04:19:06.540 --> 04:19:09.100]   Shh, she whispered.
[04:19:09.100 --> 04:19:12.620]   Tears blurring her eyes as she kissed his muzzle.
[04:19:12.620 --> 04:19:15.900]   He didn't listen to her sloppily licking her face.
[04:19:15.900 --> 04:19:17.980]   Where have you been?
[04:19:17.980 --> 04:19:19.100]   She whispered,
[04:19:19.100 --> 04:19:21.900]   scratching him behind one floppy ear,
[04:19:21.900 --> 04:19:24.380]   running her other hand along the thick muscle of his neck.
[04:19:24.380 --> 04:19:27.580]   Been feeding all right by the look of you?
[04:19:27.820 --> 04:19:30.380]   Something was tied around him.
[04:19:30.380 --> 04:19:33.900]   Cohen lifted it and inspected the long strip of leather.
[04:19:33.900 --> 04:19:35.580]   A leash.
[04:19:35.580 --> 04:19:39.580]   Then another sound caught her attention,
[04:19:39.580 --> 04:19:41.740]   a rustling close by in the herb bed,
[04:19:41.740 --> 04:19:44.140]   amongst the thick leaves of the basil and peppermint.
[04:19:44.140 --> 04:19:45.980]   She squinted,
[04:19:45.980 --> 04:19:47.580]   narrowed her eyes,
[04:19:47.580 --> 04:19:50.140]   saw someone appear from between the greenery.
[04:19:50.140 --> 04:19:52.940]   A face, small and pale,
[04:19:52.940 --> 04:19:54.220]   dirt stained.
[04:19:54.220 --> 04:19:56.140]   It was Halen.
[04:19:56.780 --> 04:19:59.260]   [Music]
[04:19:59.260 --> 04:20:01.180]   Chapter 19.
[04:20:01.180 --> 04:20:02.780]   Uthas.
[04:20:02.780 --> 04:20:06.940]   Ravens and crows.
[04:20:06.940 --> 04:20:08.540]   Uthas muttered,
[04:20:08.540 --> 04:20:10.540]   as he trudged through the marshland,
[04:20:10.540 --> 04:20:11.740]   eyes looking skyward.
[04:20:11.740 --> 04:20:13.900]   He stumbled,
[04:20:13.900 --> 04:20:17.580]   his foot sinking with a splash into a patch of soft ground,
[04:20:17.580 --> 04:20:20.620]   and he leaned on his spear to leave himself upright.
[04:20:20.620 --> 04:20:23.180]   Salak, his shieldman,
[04:20:23.180 --> 04:20:25.420]   reached out a steadying hand from behind him.
[04:20:26.060 --> 04:20:28.700]   Marshland is not a good place for a giant to walk.
[04:20:28.700 --> 04:20:32.220]   "What's that?" Rin said.
[04:20:32.220 --> 04:20:35.740]   She was sitting in the stern of a large boat,
[04:20:35.740 --> 04:20:37.500]   surrounded by a score of warriors,
[04:20:37.500 --> 04:20:38.780]   as well as half a dozen rowers.
[04:20:38.780 --> 04:20:43.660]   Uthas was picking a path alongside the banks of the waterway.
[04:20:43.660 --> 04:20:44.940]   She was being rode down,
[04:20:44.940 --> 04:20:48.060]   a line of the knotty giants spread out along the bank behind him.
[04:20:48.060 --> 04:20:50.860]   "Ravons and crows."
[04:20:50.860 --> 04:20:52.380]   Uthas repeated,
[04:20:52.380 --> 04:20:55.260]   stopping and pointing up at the sky to where a black
[04:20:55.260 --> 04:20:56.700]   shape spiraled high above them.
[04:20:56.700 --> 04:21:00.300]   "What about them?" Rin asked.
[04:21:00.300 --> 04:21:03.820]   "She was in an unusually good mood this morning.
[04:21:03.820 --> 04:21:05.340]   The first that Uthas had seen,
[04:21:05.340 --> 04:21:08.220]   since she had learned of her wall-bands' defeat in the marshes,
[04:21:08.220 --> 04:21:10.220]   and of the death of her huntsman,
[04:21:10.220 --> 04:21:10.540]   brave."
[04:21:10.540 --> 04:21:13.980]   "I don't like them," Uthas grumbled,
[04:21:13.980 --> 04:21:15.740]   thinking of feck,
[04:21:15.740 --> 04:21:17.020]   Neman's treacherous raven.
[04:21:17.020 --> 04:21:20.700]   Rin stared up at the speck in the sky.
[04:21:20.700 --> 04:21:24.540]   "I've always rather like them," she said.
[04:21:24.540 --> 04:21:28.700]   "And I suppose this one suspects that we'll be providing its dinner."
[04:21:28.700 --> 04:21:31.820]   Uthas scowled up at the bird,
[04:21:31.820 --> 04:21:35.740]   "I, as long as it's not our eyeballs and innards that it is feasting upon."
[04:21:35.740 --> 04:21:38.220]   He looked around him.
[04:21:38.220 --> 04:21:42.940]   More boats filled the waterway, bursting with over a thousand warriors.
[04:21:42.940 --> 04:21:46.780]   "Not likely that we'll be losing this battle," he thought,
[04:21:46.780 --> 04:21:49.820]   looking at the grim faces of men in every boat,
[04:21:49.820 --> 04:21:52.940]   bristling with iron and the fifty bonuffy warriors behind him.
[04:21:53.100 --> 04:21:57.020]   More than enough to put down this little uprising.
[04:21:57.020 --> 04:22:01.260]   But since they had left the tower at the marshlands' edge,
[04:22:01.260 --> 04:22:04.620]   a dour mood had fallen across Uthas's shoulders like a heavy cloak,
[04:22:04.620 --> 04:22:05.740]   and he could not shake it.
[04:22:05.740 --> 04:22:09.420]   We should be getting on with the important business of finding
[04:22:09.420 --> 04:22:10.780]   evidence and the necklace.
[04:22:10.780 --> 04:22:12.140]   That is all that matters.
[04:22:12.140 --> 04:22:15.740]   Because when they found Neman's necklace,
[04:22:15.740 --> 04:22:17.020]   one of the seven treasures,
[04:22:17.020 --> 04:22:20.540]   then Uthas would be one huge step closer to achieving his dream.
[04:22:22.220 --> 04:22:23.340]   King of the Giants.
[04:22:23.340 --> 04:22:25.180]   No more clans.
[04:22:25.180 --> 04:22:26.780]   No more divisions.
[04:22:26.780 --> 04:22:28.220]   Just my kin behind me.
[04:22:28.220 --> 04:22:32.620]   But first, I must find the necklace.
[04:22:32.620 --> 04:22:36.220]   Then it is to Darwin and on Terrace to find the cup, and then…
[04:22:36.220 --> 04:22:41.580]   He saw wraith appear up ahead, moving smoothly across the ground.
[04:22:41.580 --> 04:22:42.540]   He's two hounds with him.
[04:22:42.540 --> 04:22:45.820]   He ran across the marshland towards them,
[04:22:45.820 --> 04:22:48.700]   hardly glancing at where he was putting his feet.
[04:22:50.460 --> 04:22:52.780]   Everything about the lad screamed vitality.
[04:22:52.780 --> 04:22:57.260]   Uthas rubbed at the smaller of his back and frowned.
[04:22:57.260 --> 04:23:01.580]   "There is something about him," Uthas mused, different.
[04:23:01.580 --> 04:23:03.340]   He hides something.
[04:23:03.340 --> 04:23:07.260]   "Rave comes," Uthas said across the water to Rin.
[04:23:07.260 --> 04:23:09.660]   She held up her hand.
[04:23:09.660 --> 04:23:14.060]   The rudderman of her boat guided them towards the bank,
[04:23:14.060 --> 04:23:15.020]   the rowers slowing.
[04:23:15.020 --> 04:23:18.620]   All along their convoy, men did the same.
[04:23:19.100 --> 04:23:22.060]   The boats rippled into a halt like a long, sinuous water snake.
[04:23:22.060 --> 04:23:25.100]   "Is he alone?" Rin asked,
[04:23:25.100 --> 04:23:27.740]   as Uthas took her hand and helped to step from the boat.
[04:23:27.740 --> 04:23:28.060]   "I?"
[04:23:28.060 --> 04:23:34.140]   Rave had been given a score of woodsmen to help him scout out the ruins of Duncrin,
[04:23:34.140 --> 04:23:36.220]   not that he seemed to need help.
[04:23:36.220 --> 04:23:39.500]   "Be careful," Uthas said.
[04:23:39.500 --> 04:23:40.700]   "I don't trust him."
[04:23:40.700 --> 04:23:47.580]   "I don't trust anyone," Rin replied with a scathing look and fixed her eyes on Rave as he approached them.
[04:23:48.620 --> 04:23:52.940]   His two hounds reached them first, prowling a circle around Uthas which he didn't like.
[04:23:52.940 --> 04:23:57.740]   Rave sprang across a stream and pulled to a halt, dipping his head to Rin.
[04:23:57.740 --> 04:24:00.940]   "My queen?" he said.
[04:24:00.940 --> 04:24:02.700]   "Well?" Rin snapped.
[04:24:02.700 --> 04:24:04.700]   Duncrin is ahead.
[04:24:04.700 --> 04:24:07.100]   A smile touched Rin's mouth.
[04:24:07.100 --> 04:24:09.260]   "It is abandoned."
[04:24:09.260 --> 04:24:16.940]   "Well, he wasn't lying," Uthas thought, as he stepped around a long branch
[04:24:16.940 --> 04:24:19.500]   willow and saw the ancient fortress towering out of the lake.
[04:24:19.500 --> 04:24:23.020]   He heard Salak mutter a curse behind him.
[04:24:23.020 --> 04:24:27.180]   His shieldmen had not seen Duncrin before, and it was a tragic sight,
[04:24:27.180 --> 04:24:29.980]   the once-proud fortress laid low by time and circumstance.
[04:24:29.980 --> 04:24:34.620]   Dark walls and towers reared from the lake's water,
[04:24:34.620 --> 04:24:37.180]   like these submerged boughs of a rotting tree,
[04:24:37.180 --> 04:24:40.540]   reed and slime hanging from the decaying battlements.
[04:24:40.540 --> 04:24:43.180]   A great work brought down.
[04:24:44.060 --> 04:24:47.420]   "When I am king, I will restore the glory of my king."
[04:24:47.420 --> 04:24:51.500]   Ahead of him, Rin hissed in frustration.
[04:24:51.500 --> 04:24:54.940]   "There's no one here," more Kant said.
[04:24:54.940 --> 04:24:59.900]   "Your powers of observation are staggering," Rin said,
[04:24:59.900 --> 04:25:03.020]   barely contained rage dripping from each word.
[04:25:03.020 --> 04:25:07.580]   A strange sound rang out overhead, making Uthas jump.
[04:25:07.580 --> 04:25:12.540]   He looked up and saw a scruffy-looking crow sitting in the branches of a willow.
[04:25:13.420 --> 04:25:16.380]   It was making a clacking sound, almost like laughing.
[04:25:16.380 --> 04:25:19.500]   Uthas gave it a dark look.
[04:25:19.500 --> 04:25:23.180]   Still making the odd noise, the crow winged into the air,
[04:25:23.180 --> 04:25:24.860]   spiled up and flew away.
[04:25:24.860 --> 04:25:30.300]   Warriors were disembarking from boats to stand all along the lake shore.
[04:25:30.300 --> 04:25:34.460]   Others had rode out to the waterlog fortress,
[04:25:34.460 --> 04:25:36.940]   men climbing up onto the ancient battlements.
[04:25:36.940 --> 04:25:40.460]   Uthas tugged on one of the worm teeth,
[04:25:40.460 --> 04:25:42.700]   setting his necklace as he stared at Dunkrin,
[04:25:42.700 --> 04:25:44.060]   eyes sweeping the lake shore,
[04:25:44.060 --> 04:25:45.900]   the willows and alders that lined it.
[04:25:45.900 --> 04:25:48.860]   The signs of recent life were all about.
[04:25:48.860 --> 04:25:52.380]   Abandoned shelters, woven willow fences,
[04:25:52.380 --> 04:25:54.860]   cold fire pits, fishing nets hanging.
[04:25:54.860 --> 04:25:58.940]   A pile of burned clothing, old boots and belts,
[04:25:58.940 --> 04:26:00.860]   some twisted war gear, nothing much use.
[04:26:00.860 --> 04:26:05.100]   "The far shore," he said to Salak and Isa beside him.
[04:26:05.100 --> 04:26:07.180]   They have younger eyes than I.
[04:26:07.180 --> 04:26:09.100]   "Men could be hiding there."
[04:26:09.900 --> 04:26:13.100]   "Can't see anything," Salak rumbled.
[04:26:13.100 --> 04:26:15.340]   He was disappointed, Uthas could tell.
[04:26:15.340 --> 04:26:17.980]   His shieldmen had been looking forward to a fight.
[04:26:17.980 --> 04:26:20.780]   "But it's far."
[04:26:20.780 --> 04:26:25.420]   "No one there," Rafe said from a dozen strides away,
[04:26:25.420 --> 04:26:26.460]   his back to them.
[04:26:26.460 --> 04:26:28.380]   He was standing, staring at the far shore.
[04:26:28.380 --> 04:26:32.220]   "Your eyes are good," Uthas asked.
[04:26:32.220 --> 04:26:38.140]   "I can see a heron standing in the shade of that willow," Rafe said, pointing.
[04:26:39.100 --> 04:26:40.860]   Uthas squinted but could see nothing.
[04:26:40.860 --> 04:26:42.300]   Neither could Salak.
[04:26:42.300 --> 04:26:46.940]   Then there was a distant splash and her heron rose from deep shadows,
[04:26:46.940 --> 04:26:47.900]   flapping into the air.
[04:26:47.900 --> 04:26:53.900]   Rinbarked orders and warriors began to sweep around both arms of the lake shore,
[04:26:53.900 --> 04:26:56.220]   searching for hidden men wary of traps.
[04:26:56.220 --> 04:27:00.860]   Word of the last campaign against this fortress was in everyone's mind.
[04:27:00.860 --> 04:27:03.260]   "Why have they left here?"
[04:27:03.260 --> 04:27:05.740]   More can't ask no one in particular.
[04:27:06.540 --> 04:27:09.260]   "To avoid you, I would suspect," Rin said.
[04:27:09.260 --> 04:27:13.820]   More can't nod it at that, thinking it a perfectly reasonable answer.
[04:27:13.820 --> 04:27:16.300]   "Well, we must chase them then," he said.
[04:27:16.300 --> 04:27:18.940]   "A fine idea," Rin muttered.
[04:27:18.940 --> 04:27:19.740]   "Or maybe not.
[04:27:19.740 --> 04:27:20.860]   What do you think, Rafe?"
[04:27:20.860 --> 04:27:25.020]   The young huntsman frowned at that, was silent a while.
[04:27:25.020 --> 04:27:29.500]   "I can track them for you, my lady," he eventually said.
[04:27:29.500 --> 04:27:32.460]   "But I don't think it would be wise for your whole war bound to give chase."
[04:27:33.420 --> 04:27:36.540]   We could be led straight into another trap like last time, or worse.
[04:27:36.540 --> 04:27:41.260]   "Here we know the land, now, and your numbers would tell.
[04:27:41.260 --> 04:27:44.540]   Out there," he gestured at the stinking marshland.
[04:27:44.540 --> 04:27:45.100]   "Who knows?"
[04:27:45.100 --> 04:27:49.340]   Calls were drifting over from the fortress,
[04:27:49.340 --> 04:27:51.820]   men signaling that the ruins were empty.
[04:27:51.820 --> 04:27:56.780]   Other men started adding their voices from the lake shore as they circled around.
[04:27:56.780 --> 04:28:00.380]   "They're fled," Salak rumbled.
[04:28:00.380 --> 04:28:03.020]   "Yes," Rin agreed sourly.
[04:28:03.580 --> 04:28:05.900]   "But the question is not why, but where?"
[04:28:05.900 --> 04:28:07.900]   "Where are they?
[04:28:07.900 --> 04:28:11.980]   While we are stuck in the heart of Dunkrin, where are they?
[04:28:11.980 --> 04:28:13.980]   And what are they doing?"
[04:28:13.980 --> 04:28:17.500]   And where is Evanis, who thus thought?
[04:28:17.500 --> 04:28:18.940]   He is the real prize.
[04:28:18.940 --> 04:28:22.700]   The only man with knowledge of where no man's necklace is,
[04:28:22.700 --> 04:28:24.380]   or else his smoke on the wind.
[04:28:24.380 --> 04:28:28.460]   Voices shouted from further along the lake shore,
[04:28:28.460 --> 04:28:30.460]   a different tone and cadence.
[04:28:31.500 --> 04:28:35.180]   Men appeared with someone definitely unwary alike between them.
[04:28:35.180 --> 04:28:40.300]   She was brought before Rin, a woman of exceeding beauty,
[04:28:40.300 --> 04:28:43.580]   if that's surmised, beneath the starvation and grime that coated her.
[04:28:43.580 --> 04:28:46.780]   She was dark-haired with green eyes.
[04:28:46.780 --> 04:28:49.980]   As she was held before Rin,
[04:28:49.980 --> 04:28:53.340]   if thus saw a host of emotions sweep this new woman's face,
[04:28:53.340 --> 04:28:57.340]   pride, fear, hatred, hope.
[04:28:59.100 --> 04:29:01.900]   Rin stared at her, then began to laugh.
[04:29:01.900 --> 04:29:06.860]   Chapter 20
[04:29:06.860 --> 04:29:08.620]   Kamlin
[04:29:08.620 --> 04:29:14.460]   "Torchit," Kamlin said, lifting his bow.
[04:29:14.460 --> 04:29:17.500]   A flaming arrow leapt into the air,
[04:29:17.500 --> 04:29:18.860]   followed by twenty more,
[04:29:18.860 --> 04:29:21.020]   all rising high into the blue sky,
[04:29:21.020 --> 04:29:24.620]   then arcing and falling towards the wooden tower and surrounding walls.
[04:29:26.140 --> 04:29:28.460]   "Again," Kamlin ordered,
[04:29:28.460 --> 04:29:31.260]   as the first volley slammed into the wooden palisade,
[04:29:31.260 --> 04:29:32.700]   gates and buildings beyond.
[04:29:32.700 --> 04:29:37.180]   Meg dipped her torch into an iron brazier,
[04:29:37.180 --> 04:29:38.460]   crackling with fire,
[04:29:38.460 --> 04:29:39.500]   and ran along the line,
[04:29:39.500 --> 04:29:42.140]   igniting the arrows of Kamlin and the twenty other archers.
[04:29:42.140 --> 04:29:46.940]   They were standing on a shallow slope between the marshes and Morcan's tower.
[04:29:46.940 --> 04:29:50.140]   It done as war-bound spread in a loose circle about it.
[04:29:50.140 --> 04:29:54.860]   On a plane to Kamlin's right stood the remains of an abandoned camp.
[04:29:55.580 --> 04:29:59.180]   Trampled grass, fire pits, torn tents,
[04:29:59.180 --> 04:30:00.140]   the stench of midden.
[04:30:00.140 --> 04:30:03.500]   The lot of men filled that space,
[04:30:03.500 --> 04:30:05.500]   Rin's not underestimating us this time,
[04:30:05.500 --> 04:30:08.780]   those shall be finding out soon that we're not playing by her rules.
[04:30:08.780 --> 04:30:13.420]   Kamlin held his arrow tip in Meg's torch,
[04:30:13.420 --> 04:30:15.820]   the pitch and kindling catching with a hiss,
[04:30:15.820 --> 04:30:19.020]   and then he was aiming high and loosing,
[04:30:19.020 --> 04:30:21.660]   his arrow rising and falling amongst the others,
[04:30:21.660 --> 04:30:23.820]   disappearing beyond the wall of Morcan's tower.
[04:30:24.940 --> 04:30:27.900]   Already black smoke was billowing into the clear sky.
[04:30:27.900 --> 04:30:32.220]   "They'll see that for a fair few leagues around,"
[04:30:32.220 --> 04:30:35.740]   Baird said behind him, grinning as if he was in a midsummer's fair.
[04:30:35.740 --> 04:30:39.260]   He was stood to one side of Adana,
[04:30:39.260 --> 04:30:41.340]   Hallion and von close by,
[04:30:41.340 --> 04:30:43.980]   as well as Lorkan and his shieldman, Brogan.
[04:30:43.980 --> 04:30:47.100]   "That's the idea," Adana said.
[04:30:47.100 --> 04:30:48.940]   She was sternner.
[04:30:48.940 --> 04:30:51.500]   "Too long, Rin has had this war her own way."
[04:30:51.500 --> 04:30:53.020]   "Aye."
[04:30:53.980 --> 04:30:55.900]   "This is a message as much as anything else.
[04:30:55.900 --> 04:30:58.540]   Well, we'll not be dancing to Rin's tune any longer."
[04:30:58.540 --> 04:31:02.620]   Kamlin held out another arrow for Meg to light.
[04:31:02.620 --> 04:31:07.020]   The gate tower was a crackling torch now,
[04:31:07.020 --> 04:31:11.100]   Morcan's tower beyond catching bright flames licking one side.
[04:31:11.100 --> 04:31:14.060]   Figures were running along the wall,
[04:31:14.060 --> 04:31:15.500]   buckets of water were being thrown,
[04:31:15.500 --> 04:31:16.940]   but it seemed to be having little effect.
[04:31:16.940 --> 04:31:20.060]   Too few of them, Kamlin thought.
[04:31:20.060 --> 04:31:22.620]   Can't be more than 30 men in there.
[04:31:23.660 --> 04:31:26.300]   Rin's taken everyone else into the marshes looking for us.
[04:31:26.300 --> 04:31:31.100]   A broad smile cracked his face as he thought of Rin's expression when she heard about this.
[04:31:31.100 --> 04:31:35.900]   "That should do it," he said, slapping men on shoulders,
[04:31:35.900 --> 04:31:38.060]   and their row of archers lowered their bows.
[04:31:38.060 --> 04:31:41.260]   "Now what?" Adana asked.
[04:31:41.260 --> 04:31:44.620]   "Now we wait," Kamlin said.
[04:31:44.620 --> 04:31:46.220]   "Shouldn't take long."
[04:31:46.220 --> 04:31:49.260]   He was right. He didn't.
[04:31:50.460 --> 04:31:54.060]   Soon enough, the palisade and enclosure were burning like a forest fire.
[04:31:54.060 --> 04:31:58.060]   One desperate man leapt over the palisade,
[04:31:58.060 --> 04:32:00.860]   apprehended immediately by a pandatherine and his men,
[04:32:00.860 --> 04:32:02.060]   followed shortly by others.
[04:32:02.060 --> 04:32:05.420]   Soon after the gates creaked open,
[04:32:05.420 --> 04:32:07.500]   black clouds of smoke billowing out,
[04:32:07.500 --> 04:32:09.020]   and a huddle of men appeared,
[04:32:09.020 --> 04:32:11.100]   stumbling and coughing out onto the slope.
[04:32:11.100 --> 04:32:14.300]   Some collapsed to the ground.
[04:32:14.300 --> 04:32:17.260]   Others stood with their arms raised in surrender
[04:32:17.260 --> 04:32:18.780]   as Adana's warriors closed in.
[04:32:19.980 --> 04:32:22.620]   Pandatherine heard of the gathered prisoners down the slope.
[04:32:22.620 --> 04:32:28.540]   Kamlin glanced at Adana as she sighed and strode off towards the prisoners.
[04:32:28.540 --> 04:32:31.180]   Kamlin and the others followed.
[04:32:31.180 --> 04:32:35.660]   Thirty-six men were kneeling in the grass before Adana.
[04:32:35.660 --> 04:32:39.740]   They all wore the black and gold of Kamlin, Rin's realm.
[04:32:39.740 --> 04:32:42.780]   Adana stood instead at them a long moment.
[04:32:42.780 --> 04:32:46.140]   "How many of you were ardent born?" she asked.
[04:32:47.180 --> 04:32:49.980]   Faces looked up at her, some nodding others raising her hand.
[04:32:49.980 --> 04:32:52.780]   Twenty-eight, Kamlin counted.
[04:32:52.780 --> 04:32:57.740]   "Navon?" Adana asked, and Drost stepped out from the warriors at her back.
[04:32:57.740 --> 04:33:00.140]   Five raised their hands.
[04:33:00.140 --> 04:33:03.020]   Drost narrowed his eyes instead at them.
[04:33:03.020 --> 04:33:06.380]   "Which three are from Kamlin?" Adana asked.
[04:33:06.380 --> 04:33:09.980]   Two raised their hands, and Kamlin saw one other
[04:33:09.980 --> 04:33:12.380]   who was staring fixiddly at the grass at his knees.
[04:33:12.380 --> 04:33:15.660]   "Bring them before me," Adana said,
[04:33:15.660 --> 04:33:18.860]   and Hallion, Baird, and Vaughn moved into the crowd,
[04:33:18.860 --> 04:33:21.900]   dragging the two who had raised their hands out of the group.
[04:33:21.900 --> 04:33:26.540]   "That one," Kamlin said, pointing at the other one,
[04:33:26.540 --> 04:33:29.820]   and he was dragged forwards too and thrown to the ground before Adana.
[04:33:29.820 --> 04:33:33.260]   "You were from Cambron," she said.
[04:33:33.260 --> 04:33:36.140]   "You have come here to Arden with Rin,
[04:33:36.140 --> 04:33:38.620]   invaded my country, killed my people."
[04:33:38.620 --> 04:33:41.420]   "There was a tremor of rage in her voice."
[04:33:41.420 --> 04:33:44.460]   "You deserve death," Adana said.
[04:33:44.460 --> 04:33:46.700]   "And I sentenced you to execution."
[04:33:46.700 --> 04:33:49.820]   Adana approached the other prisoners.
[04:33:49.820 --> 04:33:53.420]   "You others, you are Arden and Navan born," she said.
[04:33:53.420 --> 04:33:55.740]   "Men nodded eagerly, she frowned at them.
[04:33:55.740 --> 04:33:58.620]   And yet you wear the colours of Rin,
[04:33:58.620 --> 04:34:00.780]   queen of Cambron, you have betrayed,
[04:34:00.780 --> 04:34:02.220]   your country served your enemy."
[04:34:02.220 --> 04:34:06.780]   Kamlin saw fear ripple through them like wind through long grass.
[04:34:06.780 --> 04:34:11.900]   "I will offer you my forgiveness once."
[04:34:13.580 --> 04:34:15.660]   Think more and one of them will need to change their britches.
[04:34:15.660 --> 04:34:18.060]   "I will give you a choice.
[04:34:18.060 --> 04:34:22.380]   Fight for me, for your countries, or go home.
[04:34:22.380 --> 04:34:25.100]   Either way, you redeem yourselves."
[04:34:25.100 --> 04:34:28.300]   She looked long and hard at their faces.
[04:34:28.300 --> 04:34:31.660]   "If you go now, I shall not judge you.
[04:34:31.660 --> 04:34:35.340]   But if I see your faces again and your standing against me,
[04:34:35.340 --> 04:34:38.700]   I'll see you die a death worthy of your betrayal.
[04:34:38.700 --> 04:34:41.180]   Make your choice," Adana said.
[04:34:42.060 --> 04:34:44.380]   And without waiting to see their reactions,
[04:34:44.380 --> 04:34:45.980]   she turned and strode away.
[04:34:45.980 --> 04:34:49.660]   Only Kamlin saw the tears fill her eyes.
[04:34:49.660 --> 04:34:53.660]   Kamlin sat with his back to a tree
[04:34:53.660 --> 04:34:57.020]   and watched Morcan's tower crumble in upon itself,
[04:34:57.020 --> 04:35:00.540]   a great cloud of smoke and ash billowing up into the air.
[04:35:00.540 --> 04:35:04.220]   He could see the bulk of Pandathran
[04:35:04.220 --> 04:35:06.300]   as he led 50 men away to the east,
[04:35:06.300 --> 04:35:07.980]   skirting the tree line of the woods.
[04:35:07.980 --> 04:35:11.740]   Another group of men were waiting down there for trust.
[04:35:12.540 --> 04:35:14.780]   Going a separate ways for a while.
[04:35:14.780 --> 04:35:19.180]   The plan was to split into three groups.
[04:35:19.180 --> 04:35:22.940]   Pandathran, Drosd, and Adana each leading a band of warriors,
[04:35:22.940 --> 04:35:26.700]   the overall goal of each to make life an ardent hard for Rin.
[04:35:26.700 --> 04:35:32.620]   With a loud crash, the final section of Morcan's tower collapsed.
[04:35:32.620 --> 04:35:36.940]   Kamlin grinned, wishing he could see Morcan's face
[04:35:36.940 --> 04:35:38.860]   when he marched out of the marshes to see it.
[04:35:40.140 --> 04:35:43.980]   A pretty sight, that tower calmed down, he commented,
[04:35:43.980 --> 04:35:47.500]   as he leaned forwards and took a skewer of squirrel meat off the fire,
[04:35:47.500 --> 04:35:48.300]   tossing it to Meg.
[04:35:48.300 --> 04:35:53.100]   She took the meat, blowing on her fingers and biting,
[04:35:53.100 --> 04:35:54.540]   grease dripping down her chin.
[04:35:54.540 --> 04:35:57.180]   We'll have to talk to her soon.
[04:35:57.180 --> 04:36:00.380]   He was surprised to find he felt sad about that.
[04:36:00.380 --> 04:36:04.220]   Strange as it seems, she's not the worst company.
[04:36:04.220 --> 04:36:08.300]   The drumbeats of Hooves drew his eyes
[04:36:08.300 --> 04:36:11.580]   and Kamlin watched a dozen riders cantering away in different directions,
[04:36:11.580 --> 04:36:14.860]   each with a large bag of silver taken from Morcan's chest,
[04:36:14.860 --> 04:36:19.340]   each one tasked with travelling through as many villages and holds as possible,
[04:36:19.340 --> 04:36:21.740]   spreading the word of Adana's victory at Duncrin,
[04:36:21.740 --> 04:36:25.180]   that she was alive and well in Arden and that she was fighting.
[04:36:25.180 --> 04:36:30.940]   And of course, distributing a little silver to show that there was a bit of profit to be had
[04:36:30.940 --> 04:36:31.980]   if you rode with Adana.
[04:36:31.980 --> 04:36:34.540]   We're moving forwards.
[04:36:35.420 --> 04:36:38.140]   Closer to the end, whether that be victory or death.
[04:36:38.140 --> 04:36:43.820]   "We'll be leaving the marshes behind or soon," he said conversationally.
[04:36:43.820 --> 04:36:46.860]   "I know that," Meg said, as if he was stupid.
[04:36:46.860 --> 04:36:52.460]   "It might be best for you if you and I made a trip to the next village along the marshes edge,
[04:36:52.460 --> 04:36:54.540]   and I found a family to take you in."
[04:36:54.540 --> 04:36:57.980]   Her head snapped round and she glared at him.
[04:36:57.980 --> 04:36:58.220]   "No."
[04:36:58.220 --> 04:37:03.500]   "This is your home, Meg," he said, with a jerk of his chin.
[04:37:04.060 --> 04:37:10.380]   "The marshlands, these people, we'll be leaving here, going back to the wooden forest.
[04:37:10.380 --> 04:37:13.820]   That's where my kind of fighting works best."
[04:37:13.820 --> 04:37:17.100]   "We're going to war," he said.
[04:37:17.100 --> 04:37:20.540]   "And that's no place for you. You're eight summers old."
[04:37:20.540 --> 04:37:25.180]   "Walls here too," she said, looking at her feet.
[04:37:25.180 --> 04:37:28.700]   "What do you call what happened to my village? My ma'am?"
[04:37:28.700 --> 04:37:31.260]   There was a tremor in our voice now.
[04:37:32.540 --> 04:37:33.980]   He reached out and squeezed her hand.
[04:37:33.980 --> 04:37:37.100]   She sucked in a deep breath, stuck her lip out.
[04:37:37.100 --> 04:37:40.620]   "I thought about it already," she said.
[04:37:40.620 --> 04:37:44.460]   "Bad things happen everywhere. My village didn't go marching off to war,
[04:37:44.460 --> 04:37:46.060]   but wars still came and found them."
[04:37:46.060 --> 04:37:49.820]   "You can leave me here, but who's to say, more cant?"
[04:37:49.820 --> 04:37:51.660]   She paused at his name.
[04:37:51.660 --> 04:37:54.380]   Her sharp featured face twisting with hatred.
[04:37:54.380 --> 04:37:59.100]   "Who's to say the same thing won't happen again? Warbands out there."
[04:38:00.860 --> 04:38:04.220]   She waved angry at the marshes, staring at him defiantly.
[04:38:04.220 --> 04:38:07.020]   "And you just leave me here and walk away?"
[04:38:07.020 --> 04:38:10.300]   "Well, didn't expect that."
[04:38:10.300 --> 04:38:16.460]   "Aseroth toes. But that's the most words you've put together since I met you,"
[04:38:16.460 --> 04:38:18.700]   Kamlin said, blowing out a long breath.
[04:38:18.700 --> 04:38:21.580]   "I like it here," she added.
[04:38:21.580 --> 04:38:23.900]   Suddenly vulnerable, a child again.
[04:38:23.900 --> 04:38:29.420]   "And besides, try and leave me here, or anywhere. I'll just give them the slip and follow you.
[04:38:29.420 --> 04:38:32.140]   Done it before," she grinned mischieously.
[04:38:32.140 --> 04:38:34.140]   Kamlin sighed.
[04:38:34.140 --> 04:38:38.060]   "Looks like you've thought it all through," she nodded.
[04:38:38.060 --> 04:38:41.820]   "Well," seemed thus settled then.
[04:38:41.820 --> 04:38:49.340]   "She gave him a long look," suspicious at first, which slowly changed to something resembling pleased,
[04:38:49.340 --> 04:38:50.860]   and she went back to eating her squirrel.
[04:38:50.860 --> 04:38:56.860]   He looked back to the tower, saw a black smudge swirl around the cloud of smoke,
[04:38:56.860 --> 04:38:58.780]   and come flapping up the hill towards them.
[04:38:59.660 --> 04:39:00.860]   "Is that kraff?"
[04:39:00.860 --> 04:39:05.740]   He felt a little jolt of relief and realized he'd been worried about the old crow.
[04:39:05.740 --> 04:39:12.860]   The crow saw him and spiral down, starting cooing as it drew close and alighted upon a branch over his head.
[04:39:12.860 --> 04:39:15.020]   "Kraff? Hungry?"
[04:39:15.020 --> 04:39:21.820]   It squawked, beady eyes staring at the pile of skin, bone, and awful that had been a squirrel a short while ago.
[04:39:21.820 --> 04:39:25.580]   "Help yourself?" Kamlin said with a wave of his hand.
[04:39:26.220 --> 04:39:28.620]   "Didn't think you usually asked," he added.
[04:39:28.620 --> 04:39:33.260]   "When the crow had done, it hopped closer to Kamlin."
[04:39:33.260 --> 04:39:38.220]   "Well?" Kamlin asked. He could hear the bird's news.
[04:39:38.220 --> 04:39:39.500]   "Itadana?"
[04:39:39.500 --> 04:39:41.100]   Kraff squawked.
[04:39:41.100 --> 04:39:46.780]   "Aye, you're right," Kamlin said, groaning at his stiff back as he stood.
[04:39:46.780 --> 04:39:50.460]   "Better off saying and use once, she's over there."
[04:39:50.460 --> 04:39:55.260]   Kamlin strode through wide-spaced woodland towards idana.
[04:39:56.140 --> 04:39:59.900]   She had fewer about her now, just Halleon, Von, and Baird.
[04:39:59.900 --> 04:40:03.340]   Nothing of her earlier emotion showed on her face.
[04:40:03.340 --> 04:40:06.380]   "She just looks tired," Kamlin thought.
[04:40:06.380 --> 04:40:13.660]   "Kraff's back," Kamlin announced, and the crow fluttered down onto the log idana was sitting on.
[04:40:13.660 --> 04:40:22.300]   "You're right," Kamlin asked idana. "My queen," he added, after earlier, the prisoners.
[04:40:23.980 --> 04:40:30.300]   She passed a hand over her eyes and sighed. "So much death," she said. "Who there ever be an end to it?"
[04:40:30.300 --> 04:40:36.620]   "God, I believe there will be," Kamlin shrugged. "Calls hope have been told."
[04:40:36.620 --> 04:40:43.100]   He gave a lopsided grin. "As long as it doesn't end with ours, death that is."
[04:40:43.100 --> 04:40:50.860]   She smiled at that, a little snort of laughter. "How many stayed?" he asked, referring to the
[04:40:50.860 --> 04:40:57.260]   prisoners. "Twenty-eight," Halleon said. Kamlin nodded. "Shoss them?"
[04:40:57.260 --> 04:41:03.180]   "Not really," idana admitted. "But if I'm going to raise a warband,
[04:41:03.180 --> 04:41:06.540]   more than half the men of Ard and are probably wearing rins colors right now,
[04:41:06.540 --> 04:41:10.860]   I have to believe that it's against their will that they'd rather fight for me."
[04:41:10.860 --> 04:41:18.140]   "Think, that's most likely true enough. Always some rotten apples in the battle, though."
[04:41:19.100 --> 04:41:22.060]   "I know," idana said, "but how do we root them out?"
[04:41:22.060 --> 04:41:27.820]   "New recruits?" "Put them at the front of the first battle, and the second,
[04:41:27.820 --> 04:41:33.580]   let them prove themselves risk dying for you." The bardons will most likely run first chance,
[04:41:33.580 --> 04:41:39.340]   they guess. Bared grunted approvingly, and idana nodded thoughtfully about.
[04:41:39.340 --> 04:41:43.660]   "I'll do that," she said. "Now, craft, what news have you for us?"
[04:41:44.460 --> 04:41:50.060]   "Rin? Done, grin?" Craft said. He paused and looked at them all. "Very angry!"
[04:41:50.060 --> 04:41:57.500]   Bared laughed at that. "How many?" Halleon asked. "Lots?" Craft muttered. "Thousand,
[04:41:57.500 --> 04:42:05.340]   ten thousand, and giants, from Murias!" Kamlin raised his eyebrows. "That" explains the
[04:42:05.340 --> 04:42:11.660]   strange tract in the meadow near Morcan's tower. "God war?" Craft muttered, ruffling feathers with
[04:42:11.660 --> 04:42:20.060]   his beak. That again. Von tense the craft's words. "It must be taken seriously," Von said.
[04:42:20.060 --> 04:42:27.500]   Von had already spoken to Adana and Kamlin about this god war. Told them about how he had stolen
[04:42:27.500 --> 04:42:32.140]   the giant's book from his father, Evanis, which had, in turn, been taken from him by
[04:42:32.140 --> 04:42:37.340]   Brenna during their flight to Don. Kamlin and idana had witnessed this.
[04:42:38.300 --> 04:42:42.220]   But Von also told them of a necklace hidden in Evanis's tower at Duncarrig.
[04:42:42.220 --> 04:42:49.100]   A necklace with a black stone as a pendant. "Ask craft, what the seven treasures are,"
[04:42:49.100 --> 04:42:53.900]   Von had said. "I don't need to ask craft," Adana had replied. "I know the old tales,
[04:42:53.900 --> 04:42:58.700]   as well as any. Cauldron and cup, spear, axe, and dagger, talk, and necklace."
[04:42:58.700 --> 04:43:04.140]   "Aye, necklace," Von had said. "It makes sense,
[04:43:04.140 --> 04:43:07.580]   Don Carrig. Fortress of the Manothi, Neman, their queen."
[04:43:07.580 --> 04:43:15.260]   "So, what if you're right?" Kamlin had asked. "If one of the seven treasures isn't
[04:43:15.260 --> 04:43:20.380]   uncaring, then we must do something about it." Craft keeps squawking about the god war,
[04:43:20.380 --> 04:43:24.700]   a prophecy about Corbin and the bright star and black sun, about the seven treasures.
[04:43:24.700 --> 04:43:32.460]   "It all sounds right, strange to me," Kamlin had said. "Aye, me too," Von had agreed,
[04:43:32.460 --> 04:43:37.260]   "but you're not understanding. If craft is right, if this god war is happening,
[04:43:37.260 --> 04:43:40.780]   then what is happening here in Arden is just a pebble in the ocean."
[04:43:40.780 --> 04:43:47.580]   "If this is true, then we must help." "How would we help?" Adana had asked.
[04:43:47.580 --> 04:43:51.260]   "We must go and get the necklace and take it to Corbin and dress him."
[04:43:51.260 --> 04:43:57.100]   Adana had just stared at Von. Kamlin hadn't been sure as she thought he was mad.
[04:43:58.780 --> 04:44:06.220]   "I'll think on it." Was all she had said, and then left. "I am taking seriously," Adana said to Von.
[04:44:06.220 --> 04:44:13.980]   "Then what will be done about it, the god war, the necklace," Von pressed. "I am going to retake
[04:44:13.980 --> 04:44:22.060]   Arden," Adana said slowly, "or die in the trying. If by some stroke of good fortune,
[04:44:22.060 --> 04:44:28.220]   I am victorious, and Rin is slain or sent back to Cambrian, then I will gladly tear Ebnes's tower
[04:44:28.220 --> 04:44:34.380]   down, stone by stone, until this necklace is found, and I will personally take it to Corbin and dress
[04:44:34.380 --> 04:44:41.020]   ill. But until then, I must concentrate on what is in front of me, Arden and Rin first."
[04:44:41.020 --> 04:44:45.260]   "Wrong!" Craft said. "I like that bird."
[04:44:45.260 --> 04:44:48.780]   Bear chuckled. "He's got stones, speaks his mind."
[04:44:48.780 --> 04:44:55.740]   "Well, a good counsellor does, I suppose," Adana said. "But they also know when to stop and not
[04:44:55.740 --> 04:45:01.420]   labor a point," she added, with one eyebrow raised. "I have listened, weighed the choices,
[04:45:01.420 --> 04:45:09.580]   and I have made my decision. But," Von began, "no," Adana said, her voice rising. "Enough, Von!"
[04:45:09.580 --> 04:45:16.620]   Von scaled at her a long moment, jaw-working as he struggled with the words itching to get
[04:45:16.620 --> 04:45:27.340]   out of his mouth, then he clamped his jaw-shut and nodded.
[04:45:27.340 --> 04:45:36.540]   Halen stared at Cohen as moonlight silvered her face. He was terrified being out as he had grown
[04:45:36.540 --> 04:45:41.500]   so accustomed to hiding, but Budai had been uncontrollable after he got a sniff of pots,
[04:45:41.500 --> 04:45:45.500]   snapping his leash and heading off into the darkness, and pots had run with him.
[04:45:46.460 --> 04:45:52.620]   For one elongated moment, Halen had watched them go, then he'd been scrambling after them,
[04:45:52.620 --> 04:45:56.700]   cursing them both the entire time it had taken him to catch up with Budai and wrap the remains
[04:45:56.700 --> 04:46:02.780]   of the torn leash about his arm. Budai had calmed for a while when he reached his courtyard.
[04:46:02.780 --> 04:46:08.860]   Maybe the sounds of guardsmen and the crackling fire reminded him that death lurked around every
[04:46:08.860 --> 04:46:16.140]   corner in this place. That was until the figurehead appeared at the window. Budai had taken a few
[04:46:16.140 --> 04:46:21.660]   deep sniffs through his broad muzzle, whined, and then he was off again. Halen, standing no
[04:46:21.660 --> 04:46:28.940]   chance of even slowing him, let alone stopping him. "Hailen, what are you doing here?" Cohen whispered.
[04:46:28.940 --> 04:46:35.900]   "Chasing the dogs," he whispered back, eyes flitting between Cohen and the firelight flickering
[04:46:35.900 --> 04:46:44.860]   at the building's corner. Cohen smiled, ruffling Budai's fur. "I mean, how are you still alive?
[04:46:44.860 --> 04:46:49.580]   Where are you hiding? Are you alone? How do you have Budai with you?"
[04:46:49.580 --> 04:46:56.140]   She took a breath, clearly framing more questions. "It's not safe here," Halen said. "Come with me."
[04:46:56.140 --> 04:47:02.300]   He went to move away, but Cohen gripped his wrist. "I'll tell you everything. I promise," he said.
[04:47:03.500 --> 04:47:09.100]   He looked up, the open sky, moon, and stars feeling like it went on forever. He shouted.
[04:47:09.100 --> 04:47:14.460]   "Come and stare at him and nod it." "Follow me," he whispered, and ran.
[04:47:14.460 --> 04:47:20.140]   They passed through wide streets, always keeping to the edges, to the shadows.
[04:47:20.140 --> 04:47:25.980]   Soon they were entering a courtyard with an old oak at its centre, his trunk wide and thick,
[04:47:25.980 --> 04:47:31.660]   roots churning up the flag-stoned floor. Halen headed to a deeper shadow in its midst,
[04:47:32.540 --> 04:47:36.780]   and then he was scrambling into it, climbing into the hole that led to his den,
[04:47:36.780 --> 04:47:42.060]   his sense of safety grew palpably with each step deeper into his underground hiding place.
[04:47:42.060 --> 04:47:49.260]   "This way," Halen whispered, as they slithered down a slope about the length of a man and reached
[04:47:49.260 --> 04:47:55.180]   the spot where you could turn left or right. The familiar stench from the left drifted up to him,
[04:47:55.180 --> 04:48:00.860]   but by now Halen hardly noticed. Cohen clearly did, though, wrinkling her nose and then putting
[04:48:00.860 --> 04:48:05.180]   a hand over her mouth. "That's disgusting," she whispered.
[04:48:05.180 --> 04:48:10.860]   Halen grunted and turned right. They shuffled along a dark, narrowing space,
[04:48:10.860 --> 04:48:15.980]   forced onto hands and knees as the tunnel they were in followed a twisting root,
[04:48:15.980 --> 04:48:20.700]   then Halen heard a welcoming whine and saw a flicker of light. He smiled.
[04:48:20.700 --> 04:48:26.380]   A space opened up before him, wide enough for about six men to stand abreast,
[04:48:26.380 --> 04:48:33.580]   and about a dozen paces long. Beyond that, the tunnel narrowed again, twisting off about the
[04:48:33.580 --> 04:48:39.580]   route it followed. The small chamber was lit by a bowl of oil on a knot in the thick root,
[04:48:39.580 --> 04:48:47.180]   flame dancing upon its surface. Two faces greeted him, swaying and sift, wolf's son and daughter,
[04:48:47.180 --> 04:48:52.300]   and six bundles of fur, boot eyes and storm's cubs bouncing and leaping in their excitement at
[04:48:52.300 --> 04:48:59.820]   his return. Seeing them like this, he realized how they'd grown. They were only five or six
[04:48:59.820 --> 04:49:05.100]   moons old, but already they were all taller than pots, their necks and broad chests thickening
[04:49:05.100 --> 04:49:11.020]   with muscle. Like boot eye. They'll not grow as big as storm but big enough, and they'll be wide
[04:49:11.020 --> 04:49:17.660]   and strong, I don't doubt. "Calm down," sift scolded the cubs as they bounced into her.
[04:49:18.780 --> 04:49:22.060]   She was on her hands and knees, playing with her bag of stones and nuts,
[04:49:22.060 --> 04:49:28.700]   rolling them into each other. Some of them sift chalked white. I still don't understand that game,
[04:49:28.700 --> 04:49:33.660]   but it's kept sift quiet for over a moon. Boot eye and pots burst into the chamber,
[04:49:33.660 --> 04:49:39.900]   making the cubs even more excited. One of them froze, black-faced and brindle-coated,
[04:49:39.900 --> 04:49:45.660]   and stared at the darkness of the tunnel. It growled, revealing a row of razor-sharp puppy teeth.
[04:49:46.860 --> 04:49:52.060]   "Shadow," Halen said, reaching out a hand to the cub, but she didn't stop growling.
[04:49:52.060 --> 04:49:58.860]   The other cubs stopped their frolicing instead, too, cocking heads, and then they were all growling
[04:49:58.860 --> 04:50:05.820]   as co-in-emerge from the darkness. "Shadow," the black-faced cub, took a snarling step forwards,
[04:50:05.820 --> 04:50:10.620]   legs bunching about to leap, the others moving tight about her, all growling hackles up.
[04:50:11.980 --> 04:50:17.340]   Halen felt a real moment of panic, snapping a command at them that was completely ignored.
[04:50:17.340 --> 04:50:22.940]   Then Boot eye was standing between the cubs and co-in, bearing his teeth, daring them.
[04:50:22.940 --> 04:50:31.500]   The cubs stopped, tails dropping, submitting. Shadow gave her last little growler protest,
[04:50:31.500 --> 04:50:34.060]   and then she, too, was quiet. "Thank Elion."
[04:50:34.060 --> 04:50:40.700]   "I thought they were going to attack me," Cohen said. Looking relieved as she stroked Boot eye's
[04:50:40.700 --> 04:50:46.460]   broad head. Then she threw her head back and laughed, long and sounding slightly mad.
[04:50:46.460 --> 04:50:51.740]   "I can't believe you're all here," Cohen said, sitting down and cuddling Boot eye.
[04:50:51.740 --> 04:50:57.740]   Potts put his forelegs on Cohen's shoulder and licked one of her ears. The cubs tentatively
[04:50:57.740 --> 04:51:03.260]   approached her, sniffing. Cohen held her arms out and beckoned to Sif, who walked over and
[04:51:03.260 --> 04:51:10.460]   hesitantly allowed Cohen to hug her. After about a count of ten, Sif was sitting in Cohen's lap,
[04:51:10.460 --> 04:51:15.420]   hugging her tightly in return. "How was this happened?" Cohen asked.
[04:51:15.420 --> 04:51:21.340]   "The battle?" Swain started. "When it happened, we were here with the cubs."
[04:51:21.340 --> 04:51:26.460]   "Because Corbin had asked us to look after them," Sif said with big serious eyes.
[04:51:26.460 --> 04:51:32.860]   "He did, I remember," Cohen agreed. "We didn't know what to do," Swain continued.
[04:51:32.860 --> 04:51:37.180]   "I was terrified," Halen thought, remembering the distant dinner battle,
[04:51:37.180 --> 04:51:42.940]   the screams and battle cries, flames, smoke. He'd been in the courtyard above, playing tug with
[04:51:42.940 --> 04:51:48.220]   shadow. She'd heard it first, stopping and staring, ears going flat to her head.
[04:51:48.220 --> 04:51:54.300]   Boot eye was here, with the cubs, Swain continued. But he ran off when the fighting started,
[04:51:54.300 --> 04:51:58.780]   and then all the cubs were off as well, following him. We chased them, and then a man
[04:51:58.780 --> 04:52:06.780]   appeared in front of us. "He had rings in his beard," Sif said. "I," Swain said,
[04:52:06.780 --> 04:52:11.660]   eyes distant, remembering. "He was going to kill us, tried to, but boot eye killed him,
[04:52:11.660 --> 04:52:15.500]   ripped his throat out," Sif added, matter of factly.
[04:52:15.500 --> 04:52:20.300]   "We picked up all the cubs between us and tricked Budai into following us back here."
[04:52:20.300 --> 04:52:26.060]   "How did you manage that?" Cohen asked. They were silent a few moments.
[04:52:27.500 --> 04:52:32.460]   "I pinched one of the cubs, twisted her ear and made her cry," Halen said.
[04:52:32.460 --> 04:52:37.580]   He still felt guilty about that. "Budai followed us back here, and then we tied him up."
[04:52:37.580 --> 04:52:44.460]   "We were scared he'd get killed," Sif said. "You were right to do it," Cohen said,
[04:52:44.460 --> 04:52:50.380]   stroking Sif's hair. "Budai would have been killed." "I think he saved his life."
[04:52:51.980 --> 04:52:58.060]   Sif smiled at that nodding. By now all six cubs were rubbing up against Cohen, sniffing, nibbling
[04:52:58.060 --> 04:53:05.100]   her clothing. One was tugging at her hair, and she absently pushed it off. "And since then," Swain
[04:53:05.100 --> 04:53:11.500]   went on, "we've just stayed hidden. Every now and then, me or Halen sneak out for food and water,
[04:53:11.500 --> 04:53:15.900]   pots is good at foraging for the cubs. He's always disappearing and coming back with something for
[04:53:15.900 --> 04:53:20.540]   them." Sif screwed her face up at that, and Halen remembered some of the things pots had
[04:53:20.540 --> 04:53:24.780]   returned with—an arm once. The cubs hadn't complained.
[04:53:24.780 --> 04:53:30.220]   "What's happening?" "Out there," Swain asked Cohen.
[04:53:30.220 --> 04:53:38.380]   "I'm a prisoner," Cohen said. "I tend to the sick, wounded from the battle. Most have recovered or
[04:53:38.380 --> 04:53:45.180]   died, but there are still a few to tend to. I meant Corbin," Swain said. "And dar?"
[04:53:46.380 --> 04:53:52.220]   "Wolf! I think he escaped," Cohen said, and Swain and Sif physically drooped with relief.
[04:53:52.220 --> 04:53:56.780]   "To hear. What are my shieldmen and my friend?"
[04:53:56.780 --> 04:54:02.780]   To hear had driven Halen mad, with his strict rules about where Halen couldn't go, what he
[04:54:02.780 --> 04:54:09.820]   couldn't do. And his mom's old sayings. "I wish I could see him and hear one of those sayings now."
[04:54:11.740 --> 04:54:17.980]   "To hear?" he asked. "You're a shieldman?" "I don't know," Cohen shrugged. "There was a
[04:54:17.980 --> 04:54:23.580]   lot of confusion. Many escaped," she said, hopefully. And they're in foreign, still fighting.
[04:54:23.580 --> 04:54:29.580]   "How do you know if you're a prisoner?" Halen asked suspiciously.
[04:54:29.580 --> 04:54:33.980]   He wanted good news, but he didn't want to be lied to, treated like a child.
[04:54:33.980 --> 04:54:40.380]   A patrol of Vinthalan came back this morning. I saw them. They were more dead and wounded than
[04:54:40.380 --> 04:54:46.060]   the living amongst them. "Huh," Swain barked a laugh. "My dar's work for sure."
[04:54:46.060 --> 04:54:51.660]   "No doubt," Cohen said. "So what now?" Halen asked.
[04:54:51.660 --> 04:54:56.860]   "You could stay with us," Sif said. "I wish I could," Cohen replied.
[04:54:56.860 --> 04:55:03.660]   "But I can't. I tend to sick and cannot abandon them. Besides, if Khaled has found me gone,
[04:55:03.660 --> 04:55:07.180]   he'd tear Drassel apart looking for me. He might find you."
[04:55:08.460 --> 04:55:13.740]   "Why would he do that?" Sif asked. "Because I am Corbin's kin,
[04:55:13.740 --> 04:55:17.740]   and he thinks Corbin will come for me. I am bait in a trap."
[04:55:17.740 --> 04:55:22.780]   "Will Corbin come?" Halen Swain and Sif asked together.
[04:55:22.780 --> 04:55:28.700]   "I don't know," Cohen shook her head. "He did the last time when I was
[04:55:28.700 --> 04:55:36.940]   Caledus as prisoner. But if it's a trap," Halen said. "Then Corbin cannot come. He is our hope."
[04:55:37.740 --> 04:55:43.580]   Halen loved Corbin, admired him as the greatest warrior and leader the world had ever seen.
[04:55:43.580 --> 04:55:49.020]   "Then, you have to escape. Get out of here before Corbin comes for you."
[04:55:49.020 --> 04:55:54.620]   A smile twitched Cohen's mouth, not light-hearted but serious and determined.
[04:55:54.620 --> 04:56:01.180]   "My thought exactly," she said. "It's just a how that I'm struggling with. And now that I know
[04:56:01.180 --> 04:56:07.340]   you're here," she smiled. "You'll have to come with me as Caledus may find you an search for me."
[04:56:07.340 --> 04:56:10.700]   That thought both excited and scared Halen.
[04:56:10.700 --> 04:56:15.500]   To be away from this danger, the daily fear of being discovered in court,
[04:56:15.500 --> 04:56:20.060]   but being away from our den which has kept us safe and hidden a whole moon.
[04:56:20.060 --> 04:56:27.580]   And, talking of being discovered, I should go back to the hospice as the sun will be rising.
[04:56:29.340 --> 04:56:32.540]   Sif squeezed her harder and Cohen squeezed her in return.
[04:56:32.540 --> 04:56:39.420]   "I cannot tell you how happy I am to know that you're alive in here," Cohen said,
[04:56:39.420 --> 04:56:43.100]   "and my Budai," she hugged the hound's neck, kissing him.
[04:56:43.100 --> 04:56:47.820]   "I'll return soon," she said, then made her gabies,
[04:56:47.820 --> 04:56:50.140]   ruffling the cub's heads and hugging Sif again.
[04:56:50.140 --> 04:56:55.180]   She gave Budai a stern order to stay and then backed into the darkness of the tunnel.
[04:56:56.940 --> 04:57:01.900]   Budai whined, but he did not follow her. Halen did, though,
[04:57:01.900 --> 04:57:06.460]   and soon they were at the slope that led up to the courtyard. Moonlight showed them the way.
[04:57:06.460 --> 04:57:13.820]   "That smell," Cohen said, wrinkling her nose as they stood in the darkness at the base of the slope.
[04:57:13.820 --> 04:57:17.980]   She was staring into the darkness of the tunnel where the smell was drifting from.
[04:57:17.980 --> 04:57:22.860]   "I recognize it," she said quietly, her expression changing.
[04:57:23.980 --> 04:57:27.740]   "She looks scared." "Is that another tunnel?" she asked him.
[04:57:27.740 --> 04:57:32.540]   "It is," he said, remembering the first time he'd found this place,
[04:57:32.540 --> 04:57:37.580]   how he'd crawled that way first, eventually stopping and coming back. It gets too narrow.
[04:57:37.580 --> 04:57:44.620]   Strangely, the cub's never went that way. "Good," Cohen said, her expression relaxing.
[04:57:44.620 --> 04:57:51.900]   "Why?" "Because I know that smell, and I think there are drapes down there."
[04:57:52.540 --> 04:57:56.940]   Chapter 22
[04:57:56.940 --> 04:57:58.700]   Corbin
[04:57:58.700 --> 04:58:06.780]   Corbin sat upon a giant bear, hands gripping the high pomade of a saddle as it shambled
[04:58:06.780 --> 04:58:11.100]   along a fresh-built road that cut like a spear through the trees and undergrowth of fawn.
[04:58:11.100 --> 04:58:16.700]   Jail's road, which he built almost from the boundaries of Graham's hold to see him and his
[04:58:16.700 --> 04:58:23.820]   war band to the walls of Drasil. The bear's pace was surprisingly fast, eating up the leaves
[04:58:23.820 --> 04:58:29.900]   at a relentless pace throughout each day's travel. His legs were aching, the girth of a bear
[04:58:29.900 --> 04:58:35.660]   was unsuitable for his human legs. "I miss shield," he thought, "not for the first time."
[04:58:35.660 --> 04:58:42.700]   The trees were thinning now, the terrain changing and more sunlight breaking through the canopy above.
[04:58:44.140 --> 04:58:47.580]   There was less vine and thorn on the ground, more grass and wildflowers.
[04:58:47.580 --> 04:58:56.060]   And then, Corbin saw the stumps of trees, a whole veil harvested of timber. We are close to Graham's
[04:58:56.060 --> 04:59:03.500]   hold. With every league that he had travelled, every day that had passed, he had felt his spirit sink.
[04:59:03.500 --> 04:59:10.140]   After Michael's revelation about the prophecy, Corbin had been in the deepest depths of despair,
[04:59:10.860 --> 04:59:15.740]   but focusing on the hope of being reunited with Cohen and his friends, had given him the strength
[04:59:15.740 --> 04:59:19.740]   to endure. It had been something to live for, to fight for.
[04:59:19.740 --> 04:59:26.780]   Now he knew that, with every breath that he drew, he was being taken further away from them,
[04:59:26.780 --> 04:59:30.300]   if they still lived, and despondency had morphed into anger.
[04:59:31.500 --> 04:59:39.260]   "Hated faces appeared in his mind," Caledus, Nithair, Ildair, Rin, Michael.
[04:59:39.260 --> 04:59:46.220]   He had thought about escape, but the simple truth was that even if he could somehow break his bonds
[04:59:46.220 --> 04:59:50.620]   and slip away from his giant captors, he would not have been able to walk half the league because
[04:59:50.620 --> 04:59:57.180]   of his injuries. Even now, over a moon from when he'd been captured, they were still not fully
[04:59:57.180 --> 05:00:04.900]   recovered. Soon, though, perhaps. His ribs now were little more than a dull ache, occasionally

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840]   This is audible. Harper Collins presents The Hobbit, or there and back again by J.R.R. Tolkien,
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.000]   read by Andy Serkis.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.720]   Chapter 1 - An Unexpected Party
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:28.880]   In a hole, in the ground, they lived a Hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole filled with the
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.600]   ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.840]   down on or to eat. It was a Hobbit hole, and that means comfort. It had a perfectly round
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.520]   door like a porthole painted green with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.360]   The door opened onto a tube shaped hole like a tunnel, a very comfortable tunnel without smoke
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:02.160]   with panel walls and floors, tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs and lots and lots
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:10.000]   of pegs for hats and coats. The Hobbit was fun to visit us. The tunnel wound on and on going fairly,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.880]   but not quite straight into the side of the hill. The hill, as all the people for many miles
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.800]   round called it, and many little round doors opened out of it first on one side and then on another.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.760]   No going upstairs for the Hobbit, bedrooms, bathrooms, sellers, pantries, lots of these,
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:35.680]   wardrobes, he had whole rooms devoted to clothes, kitchens, dining rooms, all were on the same floor
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.840]   and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left hand side going in,
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.680]   for these were the only ones to have windows, deep set round windows looking over his garden and
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:56.320]   meadows beyond, sloping down to the river. This Hobbit was a very well-to-do Hobbit,
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.440]   and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses had lived in the neighborhood of the hill for
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.080]   time out of mind and people considered them very respectable. Not only because most of them were
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.760]   rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.120]   You could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:30.240]   This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure and found himself doing and saying things
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.360]   altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbor's respect, but he gained, well, you will see
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.600]   whether he gained anything in the end. The mother of our particular Hobbit,
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.360]   What is a Hobbit? I suppose Hobbits need some description nowadays since they have become rare and shy
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.880]   of the big people as they call us. They are, or were, a little people about half a height and smaller
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.760]   than the bearded dwarfs. Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no magic about them except the
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.640]   ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.440]   like you and me come blundering along making a noise like elephants that they can hear a mile off.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.920]   They are inclined to be fat in the stomach. They dress in bright colours chiefly green and yellow,
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:27.120]   where no shoes because their feet grow natural leathery souls and thick warm brown hair like
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:34.400]   the stuff on their heads, which is curly. Have long, clever brown fingers, good-natured faces,
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.720]   and laugh deep fruity laughs, especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.920]   get it. Now you know enough to go on with. As I was saying, the mother of this Hobbit,
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.480]   Bilbo Baggins, that is, was the famous Bella Donut Took, one of the three remarkable daughters of
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.320]   the Old Took, head of the Hobbits who lived across the water, the small river that ran at the foot of
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:07.840]   the hill. It was often said in other families that, long ago, one of the Took ancestors must have taken
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.920]   a very wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still something not entirely
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.880]   Hobbit like about them. And once in a while, members of the Took clan would go and have adventures.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.880]   They discreetly disappeared and the family hushed it up, but the fact remained that the Took's
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:34.000]   were not as respectable as the Bagginses, though they were undoubtedly richer. Not that Bella Donut Took
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.080]   ever had any adventures after she became Mrs. Bungo Baggins. Bungo, that was Bilbo's father,
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.760]   built the most luxurious Hobbit hole for her, and partly with her money. That was to be found
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:52.080]   either under the hill or over the hill or across the water, and there they remain to the end
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:05:00.160]   of their days. Still, it is probable that Bilbo, her only son, Loki looked and behaved exactly like
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.760]   a second edition of his solid and comfortable father, got something a bit queer in his makeup from the
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:14.800]   Took side, something that only waited for a chance to come out. The chance never arrived until Bilbo
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:22.000]   Baggins was grown up, being about 50 years old or so, and living in the beautiful Hobbit hole
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.880]   built by his father, which I've just described for you until he had in fact apparently settled down
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:37.280]   immovably. By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.400]   less noise and more green and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous and Bilbo Baggins
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.920]   was standing at his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached down
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:57.440]   nearly to his wooly toes neatly brushed. Gandalf came by. Gandalf. If you had heard only a
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.080]   quarter of what I have heard about him, and I've only heard very little of all there is to hear,
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:09.280]   you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale. Tales and adventures sprouted up all
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.920]   over the place wherever he went in the most extraordinary fashion. He had not been down that way
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.400]   under the hill for ages and ages not since his friend the all-took died, in fact, and the hobbits
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.400]   had almost forgotten what he looked like. He had been away over the hill and across the water on
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:36.000]   businesses of his own since they were all small hobbit boys and hobbit girls. All that the unsuspecting
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.040]   Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long gray
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:51.360]   cloak, a silver scarf over which his long white beard hung down below his waist and immense black
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:58.880]   boots. "Good morning," said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining and the grass was very green,
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:05.520]   but Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:14.160]   this shady hat. "What do you mean?" he said. "Do you wish me a good morning or mean that it is a good
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.080]   morning whether I wanted or not or that you feel good this morning or that it is a morning to be good
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:27.200]   on?" "All of them at once," said Bilbo, and a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.160]   into the bargain. "If you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a full of mine. There's no
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:38.480]   hurry we have all the day before us." Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:44.400]   and blew out a beautiful gray ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:51.840]   and floated away over the hill. "Very pretty," said Gandalf, "but I have no time to blow
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:58.480]   smoke rings this morning. I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:05.440]   and it's very difficult to find anyone." "I should think so in these parts, we are plain quiet
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:10.880]   folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things make you late for dinner.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:16.000]   I can't think what anybody sees in them," said I Mr. Baggins, and stuck one thumb behind his braces
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.720]   and blew out another even bigger smoke ring. Then he took out his morning letters and began
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:28.480]   to read, pretending to take no more notice of the old man. He had decided that he was not quite
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:36.080]   his sort and wanted him to go away. But the old man did not move. He stood leaning on his stick
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:42.480]   and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:50.320]   little cross. "Good morning," he said at last. "We don't want any adventures here, thank you.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:56.640]   You might try over the hill or across the water," by this he meant that the conversation was at an end.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:04.080]   "What a lot of things you do use good morning for," said Gandalf. "Now you mean you want to get rid
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:11.520]   of me and that it won't be good till I move off. Not at all, not at all that is, let me see. I don't
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:20.560]   think I know your name." "Yes, yes, my dear sir, and I do know your name Mr. Bilbo Baggins,
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:29.040]   and you do know my name, though you don't remember that I belonged to it. I am Gandalf,
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:35.120]   and Gandalf means me to think that I should have lived to be good morning by
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.480]   a bear-led-on-a-took sun as if I was selling buttons at the door."
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:45.600]   Gandalf, Gandalf, good gracious me, not the wandering wizard that gave old
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.840]   took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came undone until ordered,
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:55.040]   not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties about dragons and goblins and
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.480]   giants and the rescue of princesses and the unexpected lack of widow's sons, not the man that used
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:06.160]   to make particularly excellent fires go, I remember those, or toot you to have them on mid-summers
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.680]   Eve, splendid, they used to go up like great litties and stuck dragons and the burnings of fire
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:17.200]   and hang in the twilight all evening. You will notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:24.880]   so prosy as he liked to believe, also that he was very fond flowers. "Dear me," he went on,
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.160]   "not the Gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the blue
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:36.720]   who've had adventures, anything from climbing trees to visiting elves or sailing and ships sailing
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:42.800]   to other shores, bless me life used to be quite into…" I mean, you used to upset things badly
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:48.160]   in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no idea that you were still in business.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:55.920]   "Where else should I be?" said the wizard. "All the same, I am pleased to find you remember something
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:02.800]   about me. You seem to remember my fireworks kindly at any rate, and that is not without hope. Indeed,
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:10.400]   for your old grandfather took sake, and for the sake of poor Beladonna, I will give you what you
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:19.520]   asked for. I beg your pardon, I haven't asked for anything. Yes, you have. Twice now, my pardon,
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:28.400]   I give it to you. In fact, I will go so far as to send you to this adventure. Very amusing for me,
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:37.360]   very good for you, and profitable to very likely if you ever get over it. Sorry, I don't want any
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.480]   adventures. Thank you, not today. Good morning, but please come to tea anytime you like. Why not tomorrow?
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.360]   Come tomorrow. Goodbye." With that, the Hobbit turned and scuttled inside his round ring door and
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.960]   shut it as quickly as he dared, not to seem rude. Wizards, after all, are wizards.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:58.720]   What an earth did I ask him to tea for he said to himself as he went to the pantry.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.120]   He had only just had breakfast, but he thought a cake or two and a drink of something would
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:10.240]   do him good after his fright. Gandalf, in the meantime, was still standing outside the door
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:18.960]   and laughing long, but quietly. After a while, he stepped up and with the spike on his staff scratched
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:25.440]   a queer sign on the Hobbit's beautiful green front door. Then he strode away just about the time
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.920]   when Bilbo was finishing his second cake and beginning to think that he had escaped
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:38.960]   adventures very well. The next day, he'd almost forgotten about Gandalf. He did not remember things
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:45.120]   very well unless he put them down on his engagement tablet like this. Gandalf, tea Wednesday.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.520]   Yesterday, he had been too flustered to do anything of the kind.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:58.000]   Just before tea time, there came a tremendous ring on the front doorbell and then he remembered.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.200]   He rushed and put the kettle on and put out another cut and saucer and an extra cake or two
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:10.560]   and ran to the door. I am so sorry to keep you waiting, he was going to say when he saw that it was
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:19.520]   not Gandalf at all. It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt and very bright
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:25.600]   eyes under his dark green hood. As soon as the door was opened, he pushed inside just as if he had
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:33.440]   been expected. He hung his hoodied cloak on the nearest peg and "Warlen, at your service,"
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:40.400]   he said with a low bow. "Uh, Bilbo Baggins, at yours," said the Hobbit to surprise to ask any
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:46.000]   questions for the moment. When the silence that followed had become uncomfortable, he added,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:54.400]   "I'm just about to take tea. The break come and have some with me. A little stiff that,
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:59.280]   but he meant it kindly." And what would you do if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:04.480]   things up in your hall without a word of explanation? They had not been at the table long. In fact,
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:10.480]   they had hardly reached the third cake when they came another, even louder ring at the bell.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:18.080]   Excuse me, he said the Hobbit and off he went to the door. So you have got here at last.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.480]   That's what he was going to say to Gandalf this time, but it was not Gandalf.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:30.400]   Instead, there was a very old looking dwarf on the step with a white beard and a scarlet hood,
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.800]   and he too hopped inside as soon as the doors opened just as if he'd been invited.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:41.840]   "See, they began to arrive already," he said when he caught sight of Diwarlen's green hood hanging up.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:49.840]   He hung his red one next to it and "Barlen, at your service," he said with his hand on his breast.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:58.080]   "Thank you," said Bilbo with a gasp. "It was not the correct thing to say, but they have begun to arrive
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:03.360]   had flustered him badly." He liked visitors, but he liked to know them before they arrived,
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.000]   and he preferred to ask them himself. He had a horrible thought that the cakes might run short
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.880]   and then he, as the host, he knew his duty and stuck to it however painful he might have to go
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:22.640]   without… couple of years and have some tea, he managed to say after taking a deep breath.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:28.080]   "A little beer would suit me better if it was all the same to Yuma good sir," said Bilbo with
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:33.120]   the white beard. "But I don't mind some cake, see cake if you have any."
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:39.520]   Lots, Bilbo found himself answering to his surprise, and he found himself scuttling off too
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:45.440]   to the cellar to fill a pint beer mug and then to a pantry to fetch two beautiful round
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:51.600]   sea cakes which he had baked that afternoon for his after supper morsel. "When he got back,
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:58.800]   Balen and Dwayne were talking at the table like old friends. As a matter of fact, they were brothers.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:04.480]   Bilbo plumped down the beer and the cake in front of them when loud came a ring at the bell
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:10.400]   again and then another ring. And Al for certain this time he thought as he puffed along the passage,
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:16.560]   but it was not. It was two more dwarves, both with blue hood silver belts and yellow beers and each
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:23.040]   of them carried a bag of tools and a spade. In they hopped as soon as the door began to open."
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:29.360]   Bilbo was hardly surprised at all. "What can I do for you, my dwarfs?" he said,
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:35.440]   "killy at your service," said the one, "and filly added the other and they both swept off their blue
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:42.560]   hoods and bowed at your horse and your families," replied Bilbo remembering his manners this time.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.920]   "Dwayne and Balen here already I see," said killy. "Let us join a throm."
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.720]   "Throm," I thought, "Mr. Bangings, I don't like the sound of that. I really must
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:59.120]   sit down for a minute and collect my wits and have a drink." He had only just had a sip in the corner
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:05.760]   while a four dwarf sat round the table and talked about mines and gold and troubles with the goblins
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.400]   and the depredations of dragons and lots of other things which he did not understand and did not
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:17.200]   want to for they sounded much too adventurous when ding dongling dang his bell rang again,
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.400]   as if some naughty little hobbit boy was trying to pull the handle off.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:28.000]   "Someone at the door," he said blinking. "It's some four, I should say by the sound," said Bilbo.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.880]   Besides we saw them coming along behind us in the distance, the poor little hobbit sat down in the
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.760]   hall and put his head in his hands and wondered what had happened and what was going to happen
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.240]   and whether they would all stay for supper."
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:47.600]   Then the bell rang again, loud enough that any had to run to the door it was not for
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:53.200]   after all it was five. Another dwarf had come along while he was wondering in the hall.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.440]   He had hardly turned the knot before they were all inside bowing and saying "get your service,"
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:04.480]   one after another. Dory norie, orie, owing and glowing were their names and very soon two purple
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:09.760]   hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood and a white hood were hanging on the pegs and off they marched
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:14.480]   with their broad hands stuck in their golden silver belts to join the others.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:22.720]   Already it had almost become a throng. Some called for ale, some for porter
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:28.240]   and one for coffee and all of them for cakes so the hobbit was kept very busy for a while.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:33.520]   A big jug of coffee had just been set in the hearth, the seed cakes were gone and the dwarves
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:40.800]   were starting on around a buttered scones when they came a loud knock. Not a ring, but a hard
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:49.200]   racket on the hobbit's beautiful green door. Somebody was banging with a stick. Bilbo rushed along
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:55.200]   the passage very angry and altogether bewildered and bewildered. This was the most awkward
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:00.400]   Wednesday he ever remembered. He pulled open the door with a jerk and they all fell in one
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:07.680]   on top of the other. More dwarfs, four more and there was Gandalf behind, leaning on his staff
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:15.440]   and laughing. He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door. He had also by the way knocked out the
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:22.240]   secret mark that he had put there the morning before. "Carefully, carefully!" he said. "It's not like
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:28.720]   you Bilbo to keep friends waiting on the mat and then open the door like a pop gun. Let me introduce
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:37.600]   before buffer bomber and especially Thorin." "At your service," said Biffer buffer and bomber,
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:43.760]   standing in a row. Then they hung up two yellow hoods and a pale green one and also a sky blue one
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:50.480]   with a long silver tassel. This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously important dwarf. In fact,
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:58.080]   no other than the great Thorin, Oconshield himself, who was not at all pleased at falling flat
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.160]   on Bilbo's mat with Biffer buffer and bomber on top of him. For one thing,
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:10.320]   Bomba was immensely fat and heavy. Thorin, indeed, was very haughty and said nothing about service,
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:17.040]   but Paul Mr. Baggins said he was sorry so many times that at last he grunted, "Pray, don't mention it,
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:25.040]   and stop frowning." "Now we are all here," said Gandalf, looking at the row of 13 hoods,
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:32.080]   the best detachable party hoods and his own hat hanging on the pegs. "Quite a merry gathering,
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:37.760]   I hope there is something left for the late comers to eat and drink. But what's that tea,
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:46.000]   oh no thank you, a little red wine?" "I think for me." "And for me," said Thorin. "And
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.440]   raspberry jam and apple tart," said Biffer, "it's poise and cheese," said Biffer.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:58.480]   Import by and salad," said Bumper. "But more cakes than I ill and coffee if you love mine,"
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.360]   called the other dwarves through the door. "Put on a few eggs, there's a good fellow,"
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:08.960]   Gandalf called after him as the hobbit stumped off to the pantries and just bring out the cold
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:14.800]   chicken and pickles. "Seems to know as much about the inside of my lard as I do myself," thought
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.280]   Mr. Baggins, who was feeling positively flummox and was beginning to wonder whether a
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:25.520]   most wretched adventure had not come right into his house. By the time he had got all the bottles and
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:31.040]   dishes and knives and forks and glasses and plates and spoons and things piled up on big trays,
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:39.280]   he was getting very hot and red in the face and annoyed. "Confosticate him, but bother these dwarves,"
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:46.320]   he said aloud. "Why don't they come and lend a hand?" Lo and behold, this stood balim and dwelling
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:50.640]   at the door of the kitchen and feely and killy behind them, and before he could say knife,
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:55.200]   they had whisked the trays and a couple of small tables into the parlor and set everything out of
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:04.160]   fresh." Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the 13 dwarves all round and Bilbo sat on a stool
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:10.320]   at the fireside nibbling at a biscuit. His appetite was quite taken away and trying to look as if
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:17.440]   this was all perfectly ordinary and not in the least an adventure. The dwarves ate and ate and
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:26.240]   talked and talked and time got on. At last they pushed their chairs back and Bilbo made a move
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:32.640]   to collect the plates and glasses. "I suppose you will all stay to supper," he said in his
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:40.720]   politest, unpressing tones. "Of course," said Thorin, "and after we shunt get through the business
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:46.480]   till late." And we must have some music first. "Now, to clear up."
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:52.240]   Thereupon the twelve dwarves, not Thorin, he was too important and stayed talking to Gandalf,
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:57.200]   jumped to their feet and made tall piles of all the things. Off they went, not waiting for
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.160]   trays, balancing columns of plates, each with a bottle on the top, with one hand while the hobbit
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:07.040]   ran after them almost squeaking with fright. "Oh please be careful, and please don't travel like I can
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:14.080]   manage." But the dwarves only started to sing. "Ship the glasses and crack the plates, blood the
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:20.240]   knives and bend the forks. That's what Bilbo baggings hates. Smash the bottles and burn the corks.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.760]   Cut the cloths and tread on the fat. Pour the milk on the pantry floor. Leave the bone and
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:32.400]   bedroom mats, splash the wine on every door. Jumped the crocs in a boiling bowl, pound them up with
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:39.600]   a thumping pole, and when you finish them any a hole, send them down the halter roll. That's
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:45.280]   what Bilbo baggings hates. So carefully, carefully with the plates." And of course they did
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:50.480]   none of these dreadful things, and everything was cleaned and put away safe as quick as lightning,
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:54.800]   while the hobbit was turning round and round in the middle of the kitchen, trying to see what they
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:00.640]   were doing. Then they went back and found thorrin with his feet on the fender, smoking a pipe.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:08.640]   He was blowing the most enormous smoke rings, and wherever he told one to go, it went. Up the chimney,
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:14.080]   or behind the clock on the mantelpiece, or under the table or round and round the ceiling, but
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:21.440]   wherever it went, it was not quick enough to escape Gandalf. Pop. He sent a smaller smoke ring from
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:28.080]   his short clay pipe, straight through each one of thorrin's, then Gandalf smoke ring would go green
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:33.280]   and come back to hover over the wizard's head. He had a cloud of them about him already,
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:40.560]   and in the dim light it made him look strange and saucerous. Bilbo stood still and watched.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:47.600]   He loved smoke rings, and then he blushed to think how proud he had been yesterday morning,
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.200]   and the smoke rings he had sent up the wind over the hill.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:58.480]   "Now for some music," said Thorrin. "Bring out the instruments."
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:04.640]   Killian Philly rushed for their bags and brought back little fiddles. Dory, nori, and Orie
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.640]   brought out flutes from somewhere inside their coats. Bilbo produced a drum from the hall,
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:13.040]   Biffer and Buffle went out to and came back with clarinets that they had left among the walking sticks.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:22.240]   Dwellin and Balin said, "Excuse me, I left mine in the porch. Just bring mine in with you," said Thorrin.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:29.360]   They came back with vials as big as themselves and with Thorrin's harp wrapped in a green cloth.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:35.360]   It was a beautiful golden harp, and when Thorrin struck it the music began all at once,
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:44.400]   so sudden and sweet that Bilbo forgot everything else and was swept away into dark lands,
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:51.680]   under strange moons, far over the water, and very far from his hobbit hole under the hill.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:57.280]   The dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of the hill.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:05.520]   The firelight flicked. It was April, and still I played on while the shadow of Gandalf's beard.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.280]   wagged against the wall. The dark filled all the room and the fire died down and the shadows
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:20.960]   were lost and still they played on, and suddenly, first one, and then another began to sing as they
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:26.640]   played deep-throated singing of the dwarfs in the deep places of their ancient homes.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:33.040]   And this is like a fragment of their song, if it can be like their song without their music.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:50.880]   All over, the misty mountains cold, to dungeons deep, and caverns old, we must away,
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:27:08.240]   airbreak of day, to seek the pain, and shunned to gold, the doors of your maiden mighty spells,
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:22.560]   while hammers fell like ringing bells in places deep, where dark things sleep in hollow
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:38.880]   holes beneath the fells, for a shunned king, and Elvish lord, their menier gleaming golden hoard,
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:51.760]   they shaped and wrought and light they caught, to hide in gems on hilltop's sword,
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:28:04.640]   all silver necklaces they strung, the flowering stars, on crowns they hung, the dragon fire
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:19.920]   in twisted wire, they meshed the light of moon and sun, far over, the misty mountains cold,
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:35.760]   to dungeons deep, and caverns old, we must away, airbreak of day, to claim our long, for
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:49.040]   garden gold, goblets they carved, therefore themselves, and hops of gold, were no mandels,
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:29:03.120]   they lay their long, and many a song was sung and heard by men or elves, the pines were roaring
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:14.960]   on the height, the winds were moaning in the night, the fire was red, its flaming spread,
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:28.320]   the trees like torches blazed with light, the bells were ringing in the dale, and men looked up,
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:39.440]   with faces pale, then dragons o'er, more fierce than fire, laid low their towers,
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:50.640]   and houses frail, the mountain smoked beneath the moon, the dwarves they heard,
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:30:06.240]   the tramp of doom, they fled their whole, to dying fall beneath his feet, beneath the moon,
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:18.800]   far over, the misty mountains grim, to dungeons deep, and caverns dim,
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:35.200]   we must away, airbreak of day, to win our harps, and gold from him."
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:42.960]   As they sang, the Hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands,
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:49.440]   and by cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce and a jealous love,
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:57.680]   the desire of the hearts of dwarves, then something tuckish woke up inside him,
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:04.240]   and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine trees and the waterfalls
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:11.120]   and explore the caves and wear a sword instead of a walking stick. He looked out of the window,
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:19.120]   the stars were out in a dark sky above the trees, he thought of the jewels of the dwarves shining
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:24.400]   in dark caverns, suddenly in the wood beyond the water, a flame leaped up,
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.880]   probably someone lighting a woodfire, and he thought of plundering dragons settling on his
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:36.080]   quiet hill and kindling it all to flames. He shuddered, and very quickly he was plain
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:44.160]   Mr Baggins' a bag end under hill again. He got up, trembling. He had less than half a mind
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:48.720]   to fetch the lamp and more than half a mind to pretend to, and go and hide behind the
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.400]   the beer barrels in the cellar and not come out again until all the dwarves had gone away.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:57.600]   Suddenly he found that the music and the singing had stopped, and they were all looking at him,
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.920]   with eyes shining in the dark.
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:08.320]   "Where are you going?" said Thorin, in a tone that seemed to show that he guessed both halves
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:16.400]   of the hobbits' mind. "What about a little light?" said Bilbo, apologetically.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:25.920]   "We like the dark," said all the dwarves, "dark for dark business. There are many hours before dawn."
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:31.920]   "Of course!" said Bilbo, and sat down in a hurry. He missed the stool and sat in the
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:38.240]   fender knocking over the pocket and shovel with a crash. "Hush!" said Gandalf. "Let Thorin speak."
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:49.840]   And this is how Thorin began. Gandalf dwarves and Mr Baggins. We are met together in a house of our
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:55.360]   friend and fellow conspirator this most excellent and audacious hobbit made the hair on his toes
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:01.600]   never fall out, all praise to his wine and ale. He paused for breath and for a polite remark from
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:06.000]   the hobbit, but the compliments were quite lost on poor Bilbo Baggins, who was wagging his mouth in
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.240]   protest at being called audacious and worst of all fellow conspirator, though no noise came out,
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:20.080]   he was so flummoxed, so Thorin went on. "We are met to discuss our plans, our ways,
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:27.280]   means, policy and devices. We shall soon, before the break of day, start on our long journey,
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:32.080]   a journey from which some of us, or perhaps all of us, except our friend and council of the
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:41.200]   ingenious wizard, Gandalf, may never return. It is a solemn moment. Our object is, I take it,
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:46.640]   well known to us all, to the estimable Mr Baggins, and perhaps to one or two of the younger dwarves,
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:52.160]   I think I should be right in naming Kili in Philly, for instance, the exact situation at the moment,
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:59.680]   may require a little brief explanation." This was Thorin's style, he was an important dwarf,
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.120]   if he'd been allowed he probably would have gone on like this until he was out of breath,
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:09.120]   without telling anyone there anything that was not known already. But he was rudely interrupted,
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:15.680]   poor Bilbo couldn't bear it any longer, at may never return, he began to feel a shriek coming up
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:22.160]   inside and very soon it burst out like the whistle of an engine coming out of a tunnel. All the dwarves
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:27.680]   sprang up, knocking over the table, Gandalf struck a blue light on the end of his magic staff,
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:33.200]   and in its firework glare, the poor hobbit could be seen kneeling on the half-rug,
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:38.400]   shaking like a jelly that was melting. Then he fell flat on the floor and kept calling out,
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:45.040]   "Screw my lightning!" "Screw my lightning!" Over and over again, and that was all they could get
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:50.080]   out of him for a long time, so they took him and laid him out of the way on the drawing sofa
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:57.200]   with a drink at his elbow, and they went back to their dark business. "You're excitable little fellow,"
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:03.680]   said Gandalf, as they sat down again, "gets funny queer fits, but he is one of the best.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:08.160]   One of the best, as fierce as a dragon in a pinch."
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:13.360]   If you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch, you will realize that this was only
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:19.040]   a pre-poeticle exaggeration applied to any hobbit, even to old Took's great-grand Uncle
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.600]   Bulrora, who was so huge for hobbit that he could ride a horse.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:29.680]   He charged the ranks of the goblins of Mount Graham in the Battle of the Greenfields,
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:35.680]   and knocked their king, Gulfimbles head clean off with a wooden club. It sailed a hundred yards
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:41.440]   through the air and went down a rabbit hole, and in this way, the battle was one,
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:47.360]   and the game of Gulf invented at the same moment. In the meanwhile, however, Bulrora's gentler
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:53.200]   descendant was reviving in the drawing room, after a while and a drink he crept nervously to the
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:36:01.440]   door of the parlor. "This is what he heard, blowing speaking." "Hm, or some snort more or less like
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:07.280]   that. Will he do, do you think?" "It's all very well for Gandalf to talk about this,
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:12.480]   hobbit being fierce, but one shriek like that in a moment of excitement would be enough to
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:19.280]   weak the dragon, and all his relatives, and kill a lot of us. I think it sounded more like
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:24.720]   fright than excitement. In fact, if it had not been for the sign on the door, I should have been
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:30.560]   sure we'd come to the wrong house, as soon as I clapped eyes on the little fellow bobbing and puffing
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:36.320]   on the mat, the head and my notes. He looks more like a grocer than a burglar."
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:44.240]   Then, Mr. Baggins turned the handle and went in. The took side had won. He suddenly felt he
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:50.640]   would go without bed and breakfast to be thought fierce. That's for the little fellow bobbing on
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:57.360]   the mat, it almost made him really fierce. Many a time afterwards, the Baggins' part regretted
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:03.440]   what he did now, and he said to himself, "Bobo, you were a fool, you were writing and put your
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:09.440]   foot in it. Pardon me," he said. "If I have overheard words that you were saying, I don't pretend
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:15.600]   to understand what you are talking about or to your reference to burglars, but I think I'm writing
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:23.680]   believing this is what he called being on his dignity, that you think I am no good. I will show you.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:30.240]   I have no signs on my door. It was painted a week ago, and I'm quite sure you've come to the wrong
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:35.200]   house. As soon as I saw your funny faces on the doorstep, I had my doubts. But treatise as the
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:42.320]   right one, tell me what you want done and I will try. If I have to walk from here to the east of
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:49.280]   east and fight the wild, wear worms in the last desert, I had a great, great, great grand uncle
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:56.560]   once. Borrower took and, yes, yes, but that was long ago who said glowing. I was talking about you,
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:02.960]   and I assure you there is a mark on this door, the usual one in the trade, or used to be,
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:09.840]   burglar wants a good job plenty of excitement and reasonable reward. That's how it's usually read.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:14.560]   But you can say expert treasure hunter instead of burglar, if you like, some of them do,
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:19.440]   it's all that seemed to us. Gandalf told us there was a man of the sort, these parts looking for a
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:24.560]   job at once, and that he had arranged for a meeting here this Wednesday, tea time.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:32.000]   "Of course there is a mark," said Gandalf. "I put it there myself. For very good reasons.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:39.680]   You asked me to find the 14th man for your expedition, and I chose Mr. Baggins,
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:44.400]   just let anyone say I chose the wrong man or the wrong house, and you could stop at 13 and
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.600]   have all the bad luck you like, or go back to digging coal."
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:55.840]   He scowls so angrily at blowing that the dwarf huddled back in his chair, and when Bilbo
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:01.600]   tried to open his mouth to ask a question, he turned and frowned at him and stuck out his
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.480]   bushy eyebrows till Bilbo shut his mouth tight with a snap.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:12.560]   "That's right," said Gandalf. "Let's have no more argument. I have chosen Mr. Baggins,
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:20.640]   and that ought to be enough for all of you. If I say he is a burglar, a burglar he is,
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:25.280]   or will be when the time comes. There is a lot more in him than you guess,
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:32.960]   and a deal more than he has any idea of himself. You may, possibly, all live to thank me yet.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:39.520]   Now, Bilbo, my boy, fix the lamp, and let's have a little light on this."
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:47.360]   "On the table, in the light of a big lamp with a red shade, he spread a piece of parchment,
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.960]   rather like a map."
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:57.040]   "This was made by Thor, your grandfather Thorin," he said in answer to the dwarf's excited
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:04.160]   questions. "It is a plan of the mountain. I don't see that this will help as much," said Thorin,
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:09.040]   disappointingly after a glance. "I remember the mountain well enough, and the lands about it,
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:13.360]   and I know where my wood is, and the withered heath, where the great dragons bred."
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:19.840]   "There is a dragon marked in red on the mountain," said Bilbo, "but it will be easy enough to find
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.800]   him without that, if we ever arrive there."
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:29.520]   "There is one point you haven't noticed," said the withered, "and that is the secret entrance.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:34.480]   You see that rune on the west side, and the hand pointed to it from the other rooms.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.760]   That marks a hidden passage to the lower halls."
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:44.880]   "It may have been secret once," said Thorin. "But how do we know that it is secret any longer?
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:50.960]   Old Smaug is lived there long enough now to find out anything there is to know about those caves."
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:54.720]   "He may, but he can't have used it for years and years."
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:58.000]   "Why? Because it is too small.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:05.120]   Five feet high the door and three may walk abreast," said the runes, "but Smaug could not creep
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:12.480]   into a hole that size, not even when he was a young dragon, certainly not after devouring so many
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.560]   of the dwarves and men of Dale."
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:23.200]   "It seems a great big hole to me," squeaked Bilbo, who had no experience of dragons and
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:28.720]   only of hobbit holes. He was getting excited and interested again so that he forgot to keep his mouth shut.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:34.800]   He loved maps, and in his hall there hung a large one of the country around with all his
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:41.680]   favorite walks marked on it in red ink. "How could such a large door be kept secret from everybody
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:46.960]   outside, apart from the dragon?" he asked. "He was only a little hobbit you must remember."
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:53.680]   "In lots of ways," said Gandalf, "but in what way this one has been hidden we don't know
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.120]   without going to see."
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:01.520]   "From what it says on the map I should guess there is a closed door which has been made to look
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:08.560]   exactly like the side of the mountain. That is the usualed war's method, I think that is right, isn't it?"
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:16.320]   "Quite right," said Thoran. "Also," went on Gandalf, "I forgot to mention that with the map
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:26.640]   went a key, a small and curious key. Here it is," he said, and handed to Thoran a key with a long barrel
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:30.560]   and intricate wards made of silver. "Keep it safe."
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:36.640]   "Indeed I will," said Thoran, and he fastened it upon a fine chain that hung about his neck
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:42.400]   and under his jacket. "Now things begin to look more hopeful. This news alters the much
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:48.960]   for the better. So far we have had no clear idea what to do. We thought to go an east. As quiet
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:54.320]   and careful as we could as far as the long lake. After that the trouble would begin."
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:43:00.160]   "Or long time before that if I know anything about the route east," interrupted Gandalf.
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:06.240]   "We might go from there, up along the river running," went on Thoran taking no notice,
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:11.680]   and so to the ruins of Dale, the old town in the valley there under the shadow of the mountain.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.720]   "But we none of us like the idea of the front gate. The river runs right out of it
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:22.480]   through the great cliff at the south of the mountain, and out of it comes the dragon to far too
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:29.120]   often. Unless he's changed his habits." "That would be no good," said the wizard. "Not without a mighty
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:35.120]   warrior, even a hero. I tried to find one but warriors of busy fighting one another in distant lands,
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:40.640]   and in this neighborhood heroes are scarce or simply not to be found. Swords in these parts are
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:47.440]   mostly blunt and axes are used for trees and shields as cradles or discovers and dragons are
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:56.960]   comfortably far off, and therefore legendary. That is why I settled on burglary. Especially when
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:05.440]   I remember the existence of a side door, and here is our little Bilbo Baggins, the burglar,
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:14.000]   the chosen and selected burglar. So now, let's get on and make some plans." "Very well, then," said Thoran.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:20.240]   "Supposing the burglar gives us some ideas or suggestions," he turned with mock politeness to Bilbo.
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:28.880]   "Well, first I should like to know a bit more about things," said he, feeling all confused
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:32.960]   a bit shaky inside, but so fast, still took his lead determined to go on with things.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:40.160]   I mean, about the gold and the dragon and all that, and how it got there and who it belongs to,
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:47.280]   and so on and further, bless me," said Thoran. "I haven't you got a map, and didn't you hear our
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:54.080]   song, and haven't we been talking about all this for hours?" "All the same, I should like it,
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:58.960]   all plain and clear," said he, obviously, putting on his business manner, usually reserved for
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.720]   people who tried to borrow money off him, and doing his best to appear wise and prudent and
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:08.800]   professional and lived up to Gandalf's recommendation. Also, I should like to know about risks,
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:14.640]   out of pocket expenses, his time required and remuneration and so forth, by which he meant,
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.360]   what am I going to get out of it, and am I going to come back alive?"
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:21.440]   "Very well," said Thoran.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:31.280]   "Long ago, in my grandfather's thraws time, our family was driven out of the far north,
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:35.920]   and came back with all their wealth and their tools to this mountain on the map.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:43.520]   It had been discovered by my far ancestor, Thrain, the old, but now they mined and they tunneled,
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:50.000]   and they made huge halls and great workshops, and in addition, I believe they found a good deal
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:57.360]   of gold and a great many jewels too. Anyway, the grew immensely rich and famous and my grandfather
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:03.600]   was king under the mountain again, and treated with great reverence by the mortal men who lived
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:07.520]   to the south and were gradually spreading up the running river as far as the valley over shadowed
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:14.240]   by the mountain. They built the merry town of Dale there in those days. Kings used to send for
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:20.960]   our smiths and reward even the least skillful most richly. Fathers would beggars to take their
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:27.040]   sons as apprentices and pay us handsomely, especially in food supplies which we never bothered to
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:33.520]   grow or find for ourselves. All together, those were good days for us, and the poorest of us had money
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:40.320]   to spend, and to lend, and leisure to make beautiful things just for the fun of it. Not to speak
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:46.080]   of the most marvelous and magical toys, the like of which is not to be found in the world nowadays.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:53.760]   So, my grandfather's halls became full of armor and jewels and carvings and cups,
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:47:01.600]   and the toy market of Dale was the wonder of the north. Undoubtedly, that was what brought the dragon.
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:09.920]   Dragons steal gold and jewels, you know, from men and elves and dwarves, wherever they can find them,
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:14.400]   and they guard their plunder as long as they live, which is practically forever unless they're killed.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:22.320]   I never enjoy a brass ring of it. Indeed, they hardly know a good bit of work from a bad,
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:27.680]   though they usually have a good notion of the current market value, and they can't make a thing
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:33.200]   for themselves, not even mend a little loose scale of their armor. There were lots of dragons in
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:37.600]   the north in those days, and gold was probably getting scarce up there with the dwarves flying
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:43.040]   south for getting killed, and all the general waste and destruction that dragons make, going from
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:53.280]   bad to worse. There was a most specially greedy, strong, and wicked worm called Smaug.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:48:00.240]   One day flew up into the air and came south. The first we heard of it was a noise like a hurricane
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:05.440]   coming from the north, and the pine trees and the mountain creaking and cracking in the wind.
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:09.840]   Some of the dwarves who happened to be outside, I was one luckily a fine adventure
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:13.920]   is lighting those days, always wondering about and it saved my life that day.
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:20.240]   Well, from a good way off we saw the dragon settle on our mountain in a spout of flame.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:26.720]   Then he came down the slopes, and when he reached the woods they all went up in fire,
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:30.160]   but at that time all the bells were ringing in Dale and the warriors were arming.
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:35.920]   The dwarves rushed out of their great gate, but there was the dragon waiting for him,
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:43.600]   non-escape that way. The river rushed up in steam and a fog fell on Dale and in the fog,
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:49.520]   the dragon came on them and destroyed most of the warriors, the usual unhappy story.
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:53.840]   He was only too common in those days, then he went back and crept in through the front gate
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:59.760]   and routed out all the halls and lanes and tunnels, alleys, sellers, mansions and passages.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:06.080]   After that there were no dwarves left alive inside, and he took all their wealth
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:13.280]   for himself, probably for that is the dragon's way, he has piled it all up in a great ape far inside
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:20.960]   and sleeps on it for a bed. Later, he used to crawl out of the great gate and come by night to Dale
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:26.160]   and carry away people, especially maidens, to eat until Dale was ruined.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:32.160]   And all the people dead are gone. What goes on there now, I don't know for certain,
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:37.360]   but I don't suppose anyone lives nearer to the mountain than the far edge of the long late nowadays.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:45.040]   The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding and cursing smog,
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:53.840]   and there we were, unexpectedly joined by my father and grandfather with singed beards.
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.680]   They looked very grim, but they said very little.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:03.440]   When I asked how they'd got away they told me to hold my tongue and said that one day in the
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:10.560]   proper time I should know. After that we went away and we had to earn our livings as best we could
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:17.120]   up and down the lands, often enough sinking as low as blacksmith work or even coal mining.
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:24.560]   But we have never forgotten our stolen treasure. And even now when I will allow we have a good bit
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:30.720]   laid by and are not so badly off. Here, for in stroked the gold chain around his neck,
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:36.800]   we still mean to get it back and to bring our curses home to smog if we can.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:41.920]   I've often wondered about my father's and my grandfather's escape.
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:49.520]   I see now they must have had a private side door which only they knew about but apparently
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:55.760]   they made a map and I should like to know how Gandalf got hold of it and why it did not come down to me,
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:56.720]   the rightful heir.
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:05.280]   I did not get hold of it. I was given it, said the wizard. Your grandfather Thore was
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:13.360]   killed, you remember, in the minds of Moria by Azog the Goblin. Because his name, yes,
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:20.320]   said Thore. And Thrain your father went away on the 21st of April 100 years ago last Thursday
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:26.080]   and has never been seen by you since. True, true, said Thore.
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:34.960]   Well, your father gave me this to give you and if I have chosen my own time and way for handing it
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:40.880]   over, you can hardly blame me considering the trouble I had to find you. Your father could not
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:46.480]   remember his own name when you came to give me the paper and he never told me yours. So on the
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:54.640]   whole I think I ought to be praised and thanked. Here it is," said he, handing the map to Thore.
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:52:00.080]   "I don't understand," said Thore. And Bilbo felt he would like to say the same.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:03.840]   The explanation did not seem to explain.
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:12.800]   Your grandfather said the wizard slowly and grimly gave the map to his son for safety.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:19.440]   Before he went to the minds of Moria, your father went away to try his luck with the map
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:25.680]   after your grandfather was killed and lots of adventures of a most unpleasant sort he had.
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:32.320]   But he never got near the mountain. How he got there, I don't know. But I found him a prisoner
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:41.280]   in the dungeons of the necromancer. Whatever were you doing there, I was throwing with a shudder
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:47.680]   and all the dwarves shoot. "Never you mind. I was finding things out as usual
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:56.080]   and a nasty dangerous business it was. Even I, Gandalf, only just escaped. I tried to save your
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:53:03.440]   father but it was too late. He was wickless and wandering and if we got an almost everything except the
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:12.400]   map and the key. We have long ago paid the goblins of Moria," said Thore. "We must give a thought to
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:19.600]   the necromancer." "Don't be absurd. He is an enemy far beyond the powers of all the dwarves put
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:23.840]   together if they could all be collected again from the four corners of the world.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:29.760]   The one thing your father wished was for his son to read the map and use the key.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:35.040]   The dragon and the mountain are more than big enough tasks for you."
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:38.160]   "Yeah," said Bilbo and accidentally said it aloud.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:43.200]   "Here what?" they all said, turning suddenly towards him and he was so flustered that he
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:46.400]   answered. "Here what I have got to say."
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:53.920]   "What's that?" they asked. "Well, I should say that you ought to go east and have a look around
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:59.360]   and after all there is a side dawn dragon must sleep sometimes. I suppose if you sit on the door
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:03.280]   step long enough, I dare say you'll think of something and well don't you know?"
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:09.040]   "I think we have talked long enough for one night if you see what I mean. What about bed and an early
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:11.840]   start and all that? I'll give you a good breakfast before you go."
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:17.120]   "Before we go." "I suppose you mean," said Thoreen.
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:24.640]   "Aren't you the burger? And isn't sitting on the doorstep your job? Not to speak of getting inside
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:31.520]   the door, but I agree about bed and breakfast. I like six eggs with me ham when starting on a journey,
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:34.080]   fried not poached and mind you, don't break him."
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:39.840]   After all the others had ordered their breakfast without so much as a pleas which in
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:47.440]   we'd build by very much they all got up. The Hobbit had to find room for all of them and filled
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:53.040]   all his spare rooms and made beds on chairs and sofas before he got them all stowed and went to his
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:55:00.400]   own little bed very tired and not all together happy. One thing he did make his mind up about was
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:05.520]   not to bother to get up very early and cook everybody else's wretched breakfast.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:13.040]   The tuckishness was wearing off and he was not now quite so sure that he was going on any journey
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:19.760]   in the morning. As he lay in bed, he could hear Thoreen still humming to himself in the best
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:32.800]   bedroom next to him. Far over, a misty mountains cold, two dungeons deep, and caverns old,
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:45.440]   we must stay, air break of day, to find our home, forgotten goal.
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:53.200]   Bilbo went to sleep with that in his ears and it gave him very uncomfortable dreams.
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:57.840]   It was long after the break of day when he woke up.
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:04.160]   Chapter 2. Roast Mutton
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:09.840]   Up jumped Bilbo and putting on his dressing gown went into the dining room. There he saw
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:16.160]   nobody but all the signs of a large and hurried breakfast. There was a fearful mess in the room
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:20.560]   and piles of unwashed crocs in the kitchen nearly every pot and pan he possessed seemed to have
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:25.760]   been used. The washing up was so dizzmily real that Bilbo was forced to believe the party of the
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:32.080]   night before had not been part of his bad dreams as he had rather hoped. Indeed, he was really
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:36.800]   relieved to think that they had all gone without him and without bothering to wake him up but
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:43.200]   never thank you, he thought, and yet in a way he could not help feeling just a trifle disappointed.
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:48.480]   The feeling surprised him. "Don't be a full Bilbo Baggins," he said to himself,
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:53.760]   thinking of dragons and all that outlandish nonsense at your age, so he put on an apron,
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:57:00.160]   lit fires, boiled water, and washed up. Then he had a nice little breakfast in the kitchen before
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:05.040]   turning out the dining room. By that time the sun was shining and the front door was open,
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:11.760]   letting in a warm spring breeze. Bilbo began to whistle loudly and to forget about the night before.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:16.400]   In fact, he was just sitting down to a nice little second breakfast in the dining room by the
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:24.480]   open window when in walked Gandalf. "My dear fellow, city, whenever are you going to come? What about
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:31.360]   an early start? And here you are having breakfast or whatever you call it at half past 10.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:37.200]   They left you the message because they could not wait. But what message," said Paul Mr. Baggins
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:42.640]   all in a fluster. "Great elephant," said Gandalf. "You are not at all yourself this morning.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:48.640]   You have never dusted the mantelpiece. What's that got to do with it? I've had enough to do with
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:55.120]   washing up for fourteen. If you had dusted the mantelpiece, you would have found this just under the clock,"
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:58:00.800]   said Gandalf, handing Bilbo a note written, of course, on his own note paper. "This is what he
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:08.400]   read." Thoreen and company to burglar Bilbo greeting. "For your hospitality are since
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:13.280]   serious thanks and for your offer of professional assistance, our grateful acceptance.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:19.280]   Terms, cash on delivery, up to and not exceeding one-fourteenth of total profits, if any,
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:25.440]   all travelling expenses guaranteed in any event. Funeral expenses to be defraid by us or are
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:30.240]   representatives, if occasion arises and the matter is not otherwise arranged for."
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:36.560]   Thinking it unnecessary to disturb your esteemed repose, we have proceeded in advance
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:41.840]   to make requisite preparations and shall await your respected person at the green dragon in
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:49.040]   by water at eleven AM sharp, trusting that you will be punctual. We have the honour to remain
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:56.320]   yours deeply, thoreen and co. "That leaves you just ten minutes. You will have to run,"
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:00.800]   said Gandalf, "but," said Bilbo, "no time for it," said the wizard, "but," said Bilbo again,
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:06.240]   "no time for that either, off you go." To the end of his days Bilbo could never remember how he
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:11.520]   found himself outside without a hat, a walking stick or any money, or anything that he usually
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:16.480]   took when he went out, leaving his second breakfast half finished and quite unwashed up,
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:21.360]   pushing his keys into Gandalf's hands and running as fast as his furry feet could carry him
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:25.840]   down the lane past the great mill across the water and then on for a mile or more.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:30.400]   Very puffed he was when he got to buy water just on the stroke of eleven and he found he had
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:37.040]   come without a pocket handkerchief. "Bravo," said Bilbo, who was standing at the indoor,
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:42.240]   looking out for him. Just then all the others came around the corner of the road from the village.
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:48.000]   They were on ponies and each pony was slung about with all kinds of baggages,
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:53.680]   packages, parcels and paraphernalia. There was a very small pony, apparently for Bilbo.
[00:59:53.680 --> 01:00:01.360]   "Up you to get an off we go," said Thoreen. "I'm awfully sorry," said Bilbo, "but I have come

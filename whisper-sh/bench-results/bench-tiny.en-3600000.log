[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.020]   Roth, Book 4 of the Faithful and the Fallen, by John Gwynn, read by Damien Lynch.
[00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:17.160]   Roth and vengeance poured, John Milton, Paradise Lost.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.000]   Chapter 1 There it is.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   The year 1144 of the Age of Exiles, Hound moon.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   There it is, fell through the night air, weightless.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   He caught glimpses of the Tower of Bricken.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Caledas is still smoldering outline at the window, then below, the river coming up to meet him.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   He slammed into the water, the cold shocking the breath out of him.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   He panicked, disorientated, realizing he didn't know which way was up.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   All about him was darkness and ice.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Then something grabbed his hair, and he was surging upwards, breaking through the water in a burst of spray,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   and saw Alsion's pale broad face staring back at him.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   "They will come hunting for us," the giant shouted over the roar of the river, as the current gripped them,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   sweeping them away from the thunder of warriors' feet crossing the bridge.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   "Let the water take us far from them."
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Verida saw the sense of that, though his hands and feet were already numbing from the cold.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   He put some effort into swimming, speeding his way from Bricken, from Caledas, from the Qadashim.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   The thought still jolted him like a blow.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   They turned a bend in the river, and the fortress was gone, darkness in folding them.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   The soft weak sheen of dawn's gray light filtered down through the lattice of branches above, as Verida's met Alsion's gaze,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   an unspoken agreement passing between them, as they both headed for the river back.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   It was harder going, swimming across the current, and Verida's realized how exhausted his body was,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   but eventually he felt silt beneath his feet, his hands grasping at reeds as he pulled himself out of the water,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   and flopped onto his back, gasping, his limbs feeling lead-filled.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Turning, he saw Alsion on the bank.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Thirty of forty paces up river from him, staggering wearily towards him before he slumped down beside him with a groan,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   water dripping from his drooping moustache.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   "Thank you," Alsion said.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   "For what?"
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   "Everything.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Most of all, for helping my family escape Bricken's dungeons.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   His wife and bern.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   How long has he gone without seeing them?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And what must he have suffered, knowing they were Caledus and Lycosy's prisoners?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   And for destroying Caledus's effigy of me?"
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Alsion continued, "You have set me free."
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   He gave a shudder, followed by a smile.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   "A shadow is gone from my soul.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I feel reborn."
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   "If you mean you feel weak as a newborn bern,"
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Veridus muttered as he emptied his boot of water and tried to pull it back on.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   "Then I feel the same."
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   "That is not what I mean," the giant rumbled,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   regarding Veridus with serious eyes.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   "You set Rainer and Tane free."
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   "You set me free."
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   "I owe you a deck beyond all imagining."
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   "You are in no debt to me," Veridus said.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   "I kick the effigy's into the fire on impulse,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   not really knowing what they were or what power they held over you."
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   "But you suspected."
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   "I."
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   "Something that Fidele said."
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   He thought of Nithair's mother, hoped that she had made it to freedom
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   along with his brother, Krelis, McIn, and Halbin.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   And your wife and son, I set them free because it was the right thing to do."
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   "There was no other choice."
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   "Ah, but there was true heart.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   There always is."
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Veridus shrugged.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   "There is no debt between us."
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   "You are my friend."
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   "One of my only friends," it has turned out.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   His thoughts swept bitterly to Nithair,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   and the confession and revelations that had stunned Veridus.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   He remembered Calidus's confession.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   That Nithair had slain Aquilis, his own father.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Anger and shame twisted through him.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   "There had been so many signs."
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   "How can I have been deceived for so long?"
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   "I am a fool."
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   "How long?"
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Veridus asked him.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   "How long have you been Calidus's prisoner?"
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Alcyon smiled with it.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   "Sixteen years."
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   "That is a long time."
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   "It is."
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Alcyon clenched his fists, knuckles cracking.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   "I should have killed him."
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   "To be fair, we both tried hard on that count.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   I put a knife in his belly, threw him in a fire,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   and he shattered his chest with a wall hammer.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   "Cadoshim are hard to kill.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I'd have to agree.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Can he be killed?"
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   "Maybe taking his head."
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   "That is how the others are slain.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Others?"
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Alcyon said to the question in Veridus's eyes.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   "The Geeha," Veridus muttered, shaking his head.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   "I've been so blind."
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   "You trusted your king and your friend."
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Alcyon shrugged.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   "There are worse failings to have."
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   "Are there?"
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   "I have dedicated my life to a lie."
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   "They both sat in silence, water dripping from clothes and hair."
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   "What now?"
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Veridus said to himself.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   "It feels as if my whole life has been dedicated to an affair in his cause."
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   "What do I do now?"
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Alcyon regarded him gravely, and poked his chest with a thick finger.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   "What does your heart tell you?"
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   "I will not trust it."
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   "Look, Veridus led me thus far."
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Veridus said, "Sowling.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Your eyes are open now."
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Veridus sucked in a deep breath, felt exhaustion seeping through him.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   "What would you do?"
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   He asked the giant.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   "Find my kin, my reina, and tain."
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   He smiled as he said their names.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   "Kin."
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   "My father is slain."
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   "That is my brother, Ector."
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   "Only Krellus is left."
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Suddenly he was desperate to see his older brother.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   "Find our kin," he echoed.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   "A good place to start."
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   "Something squawked."
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   A handful of wood pigeons suddenly bursting from the trees and flapping noisily overhead.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   "We should move."
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   "We need cover."
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   "I."
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   "To the trees."
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Veridus said, as he stood suppressing a groan.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   They were halfway across the clearing when Alcyon stopped abruptly, staring back along the riverbank.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Forms appeared around a distant bend on the track.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Shadows in the half-light that forms canopy created.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Black shadows with curved swords sheath across their backs.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   "Kado Shem."
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Alcyon growled.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Veridus counted at least seven of them, moving quickly, a low-pin ground-eating paste like a pack of wolfen.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   They were spread in a half-circle between the riverbank and the tree-line.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   They are hunting us.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   They have been running all night long following the river in search of our trail.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   One of the figures paused, the others rippling to a halt about it.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   It lifted its head as if tasting the air, then gave an allulating howl and leapt forwards a new energy in its stride.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   They've caught our scent.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Veridus felt a jolt of fear.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   He'd faced giants, dregs, war bands, but somehow knowing that the deans of the other world were hunting him sent a cold shock of fear tingling through his veins.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Kalidus filled his mind, an image of the man he had thought Counsellor and ally emerging from the fire in Brickann's tower, flaying reaved and snarling.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   He has corrupted Nefair and has deceived me for so long.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   He is the author of this evil.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Fear morphed into a cold rage and he reached for his sword, lips twisting.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Move.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Alcyon grunted and broke into a run.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Veridus resisted for a moment, inexplicably wanting to stand and flank these creatures, but Alcyon dragged him along and in a heartbeat, they were only a few strides from the tree-line.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   He realized the giant had no weapon.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   No war hammer or battle-like strapped across his back, no sword or dagger at his hip.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   They crashed through the first layer of undergrowth and were immediately enveloped by a twilight world of shadow and thorn.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Alcyon forged ahead, grunting as branches snapped upon his rock-like torso, thorns whipping at Veridus, vines tangling about his boots.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   For it seemed a long time, Veridus only heard his own heart thumping the rasp of his breath, the thud of Alcyon's feet.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Then there were sounds behind him, faint at first, like the rustle of wind through foliage, but soon louder, keening cries were floating about him.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   They splashed through a string, something sinuous slivered beneath Veridus's feet, making him stumble.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   "They are almost upon us," he gasped to Alcyon.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Better to turn and fight, hold a sword in my fist than die running.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   "I know," the giant said, turning, chest-heaving.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Veridus drew his sword as they put their backs to a huge tree, the stream before them, and waited.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Forms flitted through the gloom, emerging from a curtain of shadows and thick foliage.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   One was a long way ahead of the others, clothed in the dark male of the Jihar, pale-skinned, dark veins making a tapestry of its flesh.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   It saw them and leapt the stream, arms reaching for Veridus, not even bothering to draw its sword.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   "Remember, you must take their heads," Alcyon grunted, as he pushed away from the tree, hurling himself into the oncoming catachim with bone-crushing power.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   The two fell to the ground.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Veridus hurtled forwards, sword raised, hacking two-handed at the catachim's arm.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Its hand spinning away, blood like oil, pumping languidly from the stump.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Then the two forms were rolling together again.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Alcyon ground in pain, then he was on his knees.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Arms wrapped about the catachim's torso, pinning its arms at its side.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   The creature's head rived, veins bulging as it strained to break free.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Alcyon's face turning purple with the effort, his locked fingers slowly pulling apart.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   "What are you waiting for?" the giant rasped.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   And Veridus swung his sword, chopping into the creature's neck.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Dark blood spurted from the half-severed neck, the catachim's screeching with fury.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Alcyon roared with the strain of holding the creature.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Veridus ranged his sword free, and swung again.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   The catachim's head flew through the air landing with a splash in the stream.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Its body slumped, legs drumming as Alcyon fell away and rolled clear.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   A black eye-core-like mist flowed from the catachim's neck, hissing and swirling, gathering above its body,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   forming a human shape with tattered wings of smoke spread about it and red eyes glowing like
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   colds at its heart.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Veridus stared.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Frozen.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   It screamed savagely, then it was melting away, torn and dispersed by a slight breeze.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   "What the hell?" Veridus gasped.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   "Down!" Alcyon yelled, as he surged up from the ground, a fist slamming into the jaw
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   of a leaping catachim, hurling its spinning into the undergrowth.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Almost as soon as it hit the ground, it was back on its feet, twisting like a feral cat.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Veridus hefted his sword, spread his legs to meet the impact, and then something crunched into his side, sending him flying through the air another catachim's arms locked around his waist.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   He caught a glimpse of Alcyon's standing, catachim's swarming upon him, then Veridus was slamming into the ground.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Pain exploded in his shoulder, and his sword skitted away.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   He rolled, punched at his attacker, for a moment staring into its black, soulless eyes, then they were sliding into the stream that catachim beneath him,
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   his hands fastening about its neck, squeezing, seeking to crush the life from the black-eyed abomination.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   It bucked and kicked like a wild stallion, thrashing a tempest amidst the streamwater, but Veridus would not let go.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   He felt its strength ebbing, some of its vitality fading, then hands gripped him from behind, dragging him backwards, his fingers slipping as he was hauled to the bank.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Another catachim stood over him, drawing its sword from its back as the one from the stream splashed into view.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   He rolled and saw a handful of catachim circling Alcyon, who had fallen to one knee, the giant bleeding from a dozen wounds.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Veridus tried to drag himself through the mud towards his friend.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Another catachim was held in Alcyon's arms, he had one hand gripping its jaw, the other wrapped about its chest.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   With a savage wrench, Alcyon heaved.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Veridus heard the catachim's neck break, then the sound of flesh tearing, Alcyon screaming his defiance as he ripped the catachim's head from its shoulders.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   He flung the corpse to the ground as the black mist boiled from the dead creature's wound.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   The searing pain lance through Veridus' leg, a catachim blade scoring along his thigh.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   He dropped to the ground, looked back at the two catachim on the stream bank.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   They were following him, toying with him.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   The one with a drawn sword slashed his blade across Veridus' uphill forearm, and you cut burning like fire.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   "Think, will, bleed you a while," the catachim said, layering with pale lips.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   "Pay you back for the chase you've led us."
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   It should not end like this.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Frustration gave Veridus a last surge of strength, and he rolled to his feet, pushed himself upright.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   The catachim before him grinned, then paused, cocking its head to one side.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   The figures burst out of the gloom.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Veridus' hopes rose in then fell, as he saw the newcomers were dressed in black breastplates with silver eagles on their chests.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Eagle guard.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   No doubt said by Nefair to make sure that his monsters complete their task.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   10.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   12.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   15 more men, one of them tall and wide.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Veridus blinked.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Something familiar.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Well met, little brother, the big man bellowed, grinning wildly.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   A moment's confusion followed swiftly by elation.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   "Crellas!"
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Then Crellas and his men were attacking the catachim, Crellas taking their head in one great swing of his longsword.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Another warrior swept into view.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   This one not dressed as a man of tenor brow, but gripping a knife in each hand.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   He joined Crellas, and together they attacked the catachim before Veridus.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   14.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Macquine and Crellas.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   22.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Nefair
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Nefair stood in the great hall of Drasil, and stared at the giant skeletonite's throne.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   The bones of the ribcage surrounded a thick shafted spear, the wood, dark and pale vain.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Only a hint of black iron of the blade visible.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   The rest buried in the great tree of Drasil.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   So that is scald.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   High king of the giants, and that is the starstone spear.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Scald.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   The last man to rule a united empire where giants and men live together in peace.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Will I be the next to unite this shattered world?
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   The skeleton was mottled yellow and brown, ancient.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   The brow of the skull broad and thick eye sockets, black holes that seemed to stare
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   at the fair, questioning him.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Are you worthy?
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Are you capable?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   He sighed.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   History shall be my judge, nothing and no one else.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   The hand touched his shoulder.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   Cesar was standing at the head of three-score eagle guard.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   The young warrior had been recently promoted to high captain of the fair's war band,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   now that Veridis was gone.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Ah, there it is.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Are you dead or alive, old friend?
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   It does not seem right that you are not beside me to share in this great victory.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   He had been informed of Veridis' betrayal.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   His attempt on Caledus' life and he and Altheon's escape.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Veridis.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   How could you abandon me?
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Break your oath to me.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   He looked at the white scars on the palm of his hand.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   One of them made as a blood oath of brotherhood to Veridis,
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   on a moonlit hillside in Tenabrell.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   It felt like a lifetime ago.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Words and promises spoken by different people.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   My king, Cesar said.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   It is Caledus.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   He asks for you.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Nithair looked back at the skeleton one last time,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   then turned and strode through the huge chamber.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   The dead were still being cleared from the battle of the day before.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Bloods staying the stone floor.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Mounds of corpses lay in stinking piles.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Hundreds of them.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Caddishim, Jihah, Vinthalan, Eagleguard,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Bonothee Giants, many others.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   The cost of taking Drasil had been high,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   higher than he would have imagined considering that the element of surprise had been on their side.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   But victory is victory.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   The fortress is ours, the back of our enemy, broken.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Though many had escaped, reports were coming in of pitched battles still being fought beyond the walls of Drasil.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Nithair glanced at his right as he passed an open trap door as wide as the gates of Jerelin,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   and the dark stain of blood on the stone before it.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   My Caled's blood.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   The Ben-Elim's head now adorned a spear set in the ground of the courtyard before the gates of Drasil.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   It was not alone.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   But what of Corbin, their bright star?
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Where is he?
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   He glared mistrustfully into the yawning dark of the tunnel, knew that Michael had chosen to stand and fight there to gain time for many who escaped into the tunnel.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   But Corbin, one of them.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   There had been no reports of Corbin being seen during the battle.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Had even been here.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   It had been a long night, and Nithair felt a greater wear in a settling upon him than he had ever known before.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Caesar snapped an order behind him, an eagle guard spread to either side, forming a protective column.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Drasil is not yet secure, Caesar said, and replied to Nithair's inquiring look.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   The courtyard also bore the signs of yesterday's battle.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Bodies scattered all about flies buzzing, the metallic aroma of blood everywhere.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   For an instant, Nithair thought he saw a wolf and carved tugging at the leg of a dead caddish him.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   But looking back, realised it was a small white furred dog.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   They turned a corner in a street, and the fair glimpsed the towering outer walls of Drasil beyond the layers of stone buildings latticed with thick branches.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   This is a truly remarkable place.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Branches soared above him as thick as towers with buildings of stone and iron wrapped about them bound tighter than leather armor.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   It looks almost alive.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   The tree, the bones, the fortress, its flesh.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   The rasp of a sword drawn from its scabbard drew his attention, and he glimpsed the black clothed warrior hurtling from the shadows of a doorway.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Probably, Caesar was yelling as more dark figures emerged, iron and glinting.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   The eagle-guard moved.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Shields thudding together around the fair of scuring his view.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Blood sprayed, spattering the fair's face as an eagle-guard before him collapsed.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   A black clothed gihar slipped into the gap carved in the shield wall, surging toward the fair.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   The fair drew his sword, fear and rage his constant companions igniting within him.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   The shouts and screams a battle faded, his world contracting to the gihar warrior before him.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   A woman, her dark-skinned face all sharp bones almost fragile looking.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   Truth and courage, she yelled, curved sword rising.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   There was an explosion of sparks as their weapons met, the power of the gihar's strike making the tendons of his wrist shriek, shattering on into his arm and shoulder.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   He pushed forwards, knowing to retreat, was to die, tried to move within her guard, use his short sword where her longer blade would hinder her.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   They collided, limbs tangling as both crashed to the ground, wrestling, punching, kicking and biting at each other as they rolled back and forth across the stone street with a battle raging all about them.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   The gihar struck a glancing blow that made his vision blur, then her knee crunched into his groin and he slumped, pain exploding, pulsing through him in savage waves, draining his strength.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   She pulled herself free, and half rose as he coughed into the cold stone, tried to rise, knew if he didn't, he was dead.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Fear and rage sparked inside him, sent new energy coursing through his veins. "I'll not die here."
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   The gihar stood over him, sword raised, her eyes bright with victory.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Then a form crashed into her, throwing her to the ground.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   She started to rise and a boot slammed into her jaw, sent her crashing back down.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   The figure was blurred, a buzzing clown swirling about it.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   Hands gripped him and pulled him upright, says his concerned face appeared, blood shooting from a long cut across his forehead.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Nefair looked past him, saw his rescuer pull a sword from a scabbard upon its back and raise it over the unconscious gihar.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   A kadashim.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   "No," Nefair called. The figure's head turned to look at him, the buzzing cloud parting.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   "Flies," Nefair realized, recognizing the kadashim.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   "No, Legion. I want her alive."
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   The kadashim regarded him for a moment with cold black eyes.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   "Better, dead," it said. "I want her alive," Nefair snapped.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   "Calyters may have questions."
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   "Dead, after, then," the kadashim said, then sheathing its sword.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   "Calyters, once you."
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   The flesh of its face are neck rippled, seeming to move its own accord as if something were locked within trying to get out.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   About them, the battle seemed almost done.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   Nefair scanned the street, countingly a score of his eagle guard dead to five or six of their gihar attackers.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   This part of Jassel is supposed to have been cleared, he snulled.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   "How did they get in here?"
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   He looked down at the unconscious gihar's form at Legion's feet.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   "Bring her," Nefair said, as he marched away.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   As Nefair entered the courtyard before Jassel's gates,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   he heard a rumbling growl reverberate from one of the many stables that edged the courtyard.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   He looked fondly at the doors that contained his drag.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   "Calyters stood before the closed gates of Jassel,
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   to either side of him where a host of spears driven into the ground,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   most of them adorned with a head."
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   The handful of Vinfallen warriors were planting new spears into the ground,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   while behind them, Kalyashim prowled into the courtyard's shadows.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   Before Kalyters knelt a ragged group of people, bound at wrist and ankle,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   over 300 prisoners from yesterday's battle.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Above them, eagle guards stood upon Jassel's walls.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   My warriors.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   They were easily the best discipline troops amongst those that had stormed Jassel.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   The Kalyashim and many of Lycuss's Vinfallen were involved in the pursuit of their scattered enemy out beyond Jassel's walls.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   But Nothair suspected that most by far were ranging throughout the forest, looting and drinking.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   The Kalyashim were doing other things, such as eating their victims.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Lycuss was standing behind Kalyters.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   A dozen Vinfallen ranged about him, hard-looking men, bodies lean and muscular, skin, weathered and scarred.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Lycuss lifted a water skin to his mouth and took a long drink.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   I'd wade to it's not water that he's drinking.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   The Vinfallen saw him approaching and nodded, greeting.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Nothair hid his disgust.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Him and my mother.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Ah, Nothair.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Kalyters said.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   He raised an eyebrow at the blood on the fair's face, then saw Legion dragging the Gehar warrior across the courtyard by her ankle.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   Kalyters, Nothair said, with a dip of his head.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   His old counselor was not looking his best.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Part of his face was burned, charcoal black and peeling.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Silver hair was growing in tufts from patches on his head, elsewhere cinged to stubble or burned clear.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   It would appear that the streets of Jassel are not yet cleared of our enemy, Nothair said sourly.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   As Legion dumped the Gehar warrior in front of Kalyters.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   She groaned, pushing herself to her knees as Legion's hand clamped on her shoulder holding her before Kalyters.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   "What is your name, child?" Kalyters asked, regarding her with his cold eyes.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   She spat blood at Kalyters's feet and gloured up at him.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   "Eelter," the Gehar said, "and I am no child."
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   "Well, Eelter, I shall ask you the same question that I have just put to your comrades.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Where is Corbin?"
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   "You will see him soon enough," a voice said from amongst the prisoners.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   "He will come for you."
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   "And when he does," said Eelter, as she turned her head to look from Kalyters to Nothair and like us, "he will kill you all."
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   "He is a boy, a puppet, your eel master is already slain," Kalyters said angrily, sweeping her hand towards Michael's head.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   "You are wrong," Eelter said.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   "Corbin is our lord. He slew your best, Sumer, in single combat. We all saw it. He will do the same to you."
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   "Sumor," Kalyters frowned. "I saw his head decorating your gates."
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   "Corbin killed him," the prisoners voiced called out again, one vaguely familiar to Nothair.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   "Your figure straightened amongst the captives, black hair hanging lank about her face."
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   "He took Sumer's head, and he will take yours too."
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   "Ah," Cohen.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   "I want nothing more than for him to come and try," Kalyters said with a sigh, his expression mocking, but Nothair glimpsed something else in his eyes.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   "Doubt?"
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   "But so far, he does not seem inclined to do so," Kalyters continued.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   "Perhaps a message would have speed him to us."
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   "He looked to the Kalishim."
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   "Lijian, choose one prisoner and impale them upon a spear," he ordered.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   "Lijian drabbed Cohen and pulled her struggling towards a spear, Nothair," Kalyters said, with a wave of his hand.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   "Lijian grabbed another prisoner.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   He was a man of his ill-tiered by the look of him.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   The Kalishim hoisted him effortlessly into the air and brought him down slowly upon the upright spear.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Then the screaming began.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   When it was over, the prisoner was skewered like a squirrel ready for the cookfire.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   He was writhing upon the spear, blood pooling about his feet, screaming himself to oblivion.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Nothair resisted the urge to cover his ears.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   "On your feet," Kalyters said to Elta.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   "Go and tell Koroban what is happening to his followers what I am doing.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   Tell him I will not stop until he has faced me."
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   Lijian pushed her stumbling forwards as with a rumble.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   The gates opened.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   She looked back once and then ran.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   The gates slamming behind her.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Kalyters barked in order and the remaining captives were led away.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   Koroban caught Nothair's eye as she walked in line, hatred pouring from her.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   "We must talk soon," Kalyters said to Nothair and like us.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   "Hi son, in the great hole."
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   Then he was striding away.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Like us raised an eyebrow and offered Nothair his water skin.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   "Without thinking," Nothair took it and drank, then coughed almost choking on the contents.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   "Is that?"
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   "Meade," Lyca's finished for him.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   Filling their dozen wagons with barrels full of the stuff.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Nothair handed it back to him and Lyca's walked away, chuckling to himself.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   He's been thal and following him.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Nothair headed for the wide stairs that scaled Drassil's walls and climbed to the top.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Stopping above the great gates where he stared out of the world beyond.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   A wide, plain, circled the fortress, clear blue sky bathing the ground in sunshine before
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   the great trees are formed, blotted it from view.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   He caught a glimpse of Illta just before she disappeared into the tree line.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Behind him, he heard the footsteps of Caesar and his eagle guard stopping a respectful distance away.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   The screams of the impaled in the courtyard were much fainter up here, fading to a pathetic muelling.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   He wished he would just die.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   "How have I allowed myself to come to this?"
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   "It is for the greater good.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   For me to win the war, Corbin must die.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   To bring peace to the banished lands, Corbin must die."
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   He felt his resolve stir, but still the screens wormed their way into his head,
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   reminding him of other battles, other deaths in the name of this great cause.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   And now I follow the path of Qadoshim, of demons, of Asroth himself.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   He remembered Qadoshim's words to him in Murias, so persuasive.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   "It had all been so logical when Qadoshim explained it made sense of the alliances, the lies, deception upon deception heaped in a great pile.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   But the truth is simpler, a voice seemed to whisper inside his mind.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   "Deep down, he knew."
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   It was more basic when all was stripped away.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Caled as his persuasive arguments and philosophical debates on good and evil, right and wrong,
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   the abstract meanings that were attached to names.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   Politics, power struggles, who deserved what?
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   The honest answer was much simpler than any of those meandering debates,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   and one that had been clearly reinforced by his brief struggle with the Jihad warrior before him.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   "I don't want to lose."
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Chapter 3
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   Corbin
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Corbin sat with her back to a tree, staring into the dawn gloom of form,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   absolutely twirling a knife between her fingers.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   Behind her were the sleeping forms of three score or serve the survivors within she had fled Dressell.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   Amongst them was Brenner, grey hair poking from beneath her cloak,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   beside her the bolts of feral and leaf curled close together.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   She glimpsed the Jihad, Akar, standing guard on the far side of their camp.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Exhaustion halved at the fringes of her consciousness, and in so many ways it would be wonderful to lose herself
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   and the nothingness of sleep.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   But she couldn't.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   Her mind was reeling, a whirlwind of grief, fear and rage as fractured moments of the previous day played out in her mind's eye.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   Out of them all, though, everything kept returning to one thought circling.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   Where is Corbin?
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   The fog of tiredness crept upon her again.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   A relentless assault, but she knew that sleep would not come, the shock and horror of yesterday's battle was still too present.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   There was a soft footfall from behind, and a figure came to stand beside her.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Gah.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   The lord of the Jihad looked at her, lines of worry etched upon his usually unreadable face.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   He was clothed in a shirt of dark chain-mail, splattered with grime and blood.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   His curved sword sheathed across his back, a single-bladed, throwing axe, hanging at his belt.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Even he was not free of injury.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   A blood-stained bandage was tied around his forehead.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   Storm is with him.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Gah said.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   As if he could read her thoughts.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   There must be his plan to read upon my face as I his.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Storm.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   That was a measure of comfort.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   Corinne knew that the wolfin was a better guardian than a dozen sheildmen, but still.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   "We will find him," Gah said.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   Corinne had seen the familiar scuff marks of Storm's claws in the tunnel, which was why they had exited at this spot.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   After a brief search, she'd found more tracks, leading to the brow of the slope, but darkness has settled upon them.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   No matter how frustrating, it was pointless to stumble around in the dark.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   But where can Corinne be?
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   He must have heard the din of battle from Drassel, even if he were this far away.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   The thoughts rose unbidden in her mind.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   The one thought she'd refuse to acknowledge throughout the long dark of night.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   What if he is slain?
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   What else could have kept him from returning to Drassel?
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   She felt a worm of fear wriggling through her belly, but refused to consider it.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   He lives.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   He must.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   She nodded, and stood.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   She leaving her knife, a myriad of cuts, bruises, and strains, aching for attention.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   She ignored them all.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   "We need to go," she said.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   "I." Gah agreed.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   He continued to stare at the trapdoor.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   I had hoped that my cow would find us, that he escaped."
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Corinne remembered her last sight of the Ben-Elim.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Wielding his sword, two-handed, feet planted before the entrance to the tunnel in Drassel's great hall as they had retreated into its shadows.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   Swayves of blood had surrounded him as he swung his sword in deadly arcs, holding back the enemy, protecting them, purchasing them time to escape.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   He would come by now, if he could.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   Corinne said.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   Gah sighed and nodded.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   Corinne cocked her head, listening, staring down the hill.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   Something was moving in the undergrowth, heading towards the trapdoor.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   Gah saw it too, and without words the two of them separated, slipping into the shadows as they quietly surrounded the intruder.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   Bushes rustled, a twig snapped, and Corinne caught a glimpse of dark hair.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   She knew he wasn't Corinne, even he isn't that clumsy.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   A figure burst from the undergrowth.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   A young man clad in leather and wool, his dark hair, tousled, and a scabbing cut marking his forehead.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   He started at the sight of her, fumbled for a weapon at his belt, his eye is widening.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   "I know you," Corinne said, though she didn't remember his name.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   "Your da is itilius."
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   A competent, unassuming warrior, itilius had been a slave oarsman on a Vinth Island ship.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   The lad nodded.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   His lip trembling.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   "Pax, what are you doing here?"
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   Gah said, stepping silently from the shadows, making the young warrior jump again.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   "You must come quickly."
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   Pax blurted.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   "My da.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   Corbin.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Giants."
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   "Corbin?"
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   Corinne hissed.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   "I.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   We must go."
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   Tears were spilling down Pax's cheeks now, tracing tracks through blood and grime.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   He stared.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   Corinne froze, feeling as if a fist had just clamped around her heart.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   "I ran."
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   Pax said.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   "He began to shake, an involuntary twitching that quickly became more violent."
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   "Where is Corbin?"
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.960]   Corinne asked, trying to control the panic leaking through her, reaching out to grab the
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.000]   now sobbing boy and shake the sense from him.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   "Hold," Gah said, putting a hand upon her arm.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   "Pax, you must tell us as clearly as you can.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   Where is Corbin and your da?
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   What happened?"
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   "Others were coming down the hill now."
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   Corinne glimpsed daff in colour, a handful of jihad, lathe looming behind them.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   "We heard.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   Fighting.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   New Corbin was out there."
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   Pax began, haltingly.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   "We found him, facing giants and bears."
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   "What?"
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   "But there were no giants in the fair at Dressel."
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   "Dah.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   He threw a spear at a giant.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Then we all ran.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   We thought we'd lost them.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   Then..."
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   "Go on," Gah said.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   The whole group was gathered around them now, listing in absolute silence.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   "They came from nowhere.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   My da?"
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   He rubbed his eyes, blew out a long breath.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   "They killed my da."
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   Corbin told me to run to fetch help.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   "When did this happen?"
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   Gah asked, not able to keep the urgency from his voice.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   "Yesterday, after his son before, sunset."
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   Pax's face had grown paler as he spoke.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   "Now he looked like a corpse.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   I ran.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   I fell, hit my head."
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   He raised the hand to the cut on his brow.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   "When I came to?"
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   It was dark.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   "I've been trying to find my way since then."
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   "Take us.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   Now," Gah said.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   "I will try."
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Pax nodded.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   I became lost for a while.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   But I know it was that direction."
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   Gah barked orders and then they were moving.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Corbin taking the lead with Pax,
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   Gah jogging beside the ladder, steadying hand on his arm.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   Corbin stormed, facing giants.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   Alone.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   Yesterday.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   She sent a silent prayer to Elion,
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   one of many that she had made over the last half day.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   "Let them still live."
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   Corbin was the first to enter the glade.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   At its far end was a sudden ridge,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   and beyond it, the sound of a fast flowing river.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   The smell hit her first.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   The metallic tang of blood and decay.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   Death.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   Flies were buzzing in great clouds
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   about bodies heaped on the floor.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   She counted three giant corpses on the ground,
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   and Attilius pinned to a great oak by a giant's axe.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   She could not see Corbin or storm.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   She ran to the first giant,
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   who was on his back, a hole in his belly,
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   throat cleanly cut,
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   his wrist bearing the tail tail ripping wounds of the wolfen.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   Corbin moved on,
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   dimly aware of others spilling into the glade behind her,
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   the sound of Pax's sobs as he dropped to his knees before his dark,
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   Gah's presence at her shoulder.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   The other two giants were close together.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   The ground trampled, rutted, dark and still sticky with blood.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   One's throat had been ripped out by storm,
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   the flesh mangled and torn.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   Here's not here, nor storm.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   The relief was a physical thing,
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   though she knew their absence did not mean
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   that they were safe for even alive,
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   but it was clear they had fought here and won.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   They slew three giants.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   She felt a flush of pride at that feat,
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   knew that it would be a story told around the campfire this very night,
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   adding to the tails that were growing up around Corbin
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   and his wolfen companion.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   The other giant lay upon his front.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   Gah and Corbin tried to turn him over together,
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   flies buzzed angrily,
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   the huge warrior's dead weight like a boulder.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   Ferrell and Laith joined them,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   and together they rolled the giant,
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   the stench of corruption and decay,
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   wafting up to them as they disturbed the body.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   "He is of the Jotun clan," Laith spat,
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   as they stood instead of a dead giant.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   "What are they doing here?"
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Corlin's eyes were drawn to the glint of leather
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   and iron amidst the congealed blood.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   She bent and wrapped a fist around the hilt of a sword,
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   buried deep in the giant's thigh,
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   angled upwards into its groin.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   He came free with a sucking sound,
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   and she lifted it for them all to see.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   The pommel shaped like a howling wolfen.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   The relief she'd felt fled,
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   replaced by the crushing weight of fear.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   "That's band sword," Dath said, as he joined them.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   Cola, a pace behind him.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   Corlin stared at them a moment,
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   caught a wave of sympathy for them.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   They'd been weighed less than two nights.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   Gah took the sword from her and stared at it.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   "I watched band's dar give him this blade."
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   "In the row and field at Dunkarig," Farrell said,
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   "I remember it."
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   "And I," Dath muttered.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   Cola turned away,
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   her eyes scanning the ground,
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   searching for any sign.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   "He is not here."
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   Storm is not here.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   They escaped, but they did not make their way back to Drasil.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   "Why?"
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   Brenner was on her knees beside the giant.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   The old healer had a file in one hand,
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   a knife in the other that she was using to scrape blood
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   from the trampled grass.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   One side of Brenner's face was still an angry red,
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   seared by the explosion she had generated
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   that rocked the chamber and Drasil yesterday.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   Whatever benefit Brenner thought the giant's blood would bring,
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   she was welcome to it.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   As Corlin scanned the rest of the clearing,
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   her eyes caught a patch of crushed grass spattered with blood.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   It was close to the edge of the glade,
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   leading to his sheer drop to the river below.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   As if something were dragged,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   she followed the marks and dropped to a crouch,
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   looking down to the river.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   Further down she spied a dark smear on a boulder.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   Blood.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   They jumped into the river.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   She galled out.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   Gar was first to join her.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   His eyes found the same evidence,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   and he gripped her wrist.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   After them, he said.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   Corlin led the way,
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   running along the ridge that shadowed the river,
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   twisting around thick-rooted trees in dense vegetation.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   Her eyes flitting between the path she was navigating
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   and the banks of the river.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   Rounding a sharp bend in the path,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   she suddenly saw a shape lying on a grassy verge,
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   firm atted, and bloodstained.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   Her heart stopped.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   Storm.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   She skidied to a halt on the ridge above the wolfen,
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   her part of her mind noticing large boot prints in the grass.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   In a spray of dirt,
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   she scrambled over the edge,
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   clinging to root and vine as she made her way down to the river bank.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   Storm lay still as stone,
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   and she was covered in blood a huge wound was visible above her shoulder.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   Corlin crouched, too scared to touch her,
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   not wanting to confirm what her eyes were telling her.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   Stifling tears,
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   she remembered the first time she had seen Storm,
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   when she had threatened to turn the wolfen into a cloak.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   Even then, she had seen the bond between Corbin
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   and his faithful and vigilant shadow.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   Since then, she had developed her own bond with the wolfen,
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   more like a sword brother to her than a mere animal.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   As guard joined her,
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   she tentatively reached out her hand and laid it upon Storm's body.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   She felt nothing.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   No.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   Please, Elion above.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   She screwed her eyes shut tight,
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   pressed harder,
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   flattening her palm against Storm's deep chest,
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   willing her hands to feel the movement of life,
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   a drawn breath, the pumping of Storm's heart.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   With every moment, her hopes faded,
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   a bleakness taking hold inside spreading through her like ink through water.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   And then, she felt it.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   A flicker, a heartbeat deep within the cavern of Storm's broad chest.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   Corlin opened her eyes and saw Storm's amber gaze regarding her.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   The wolfen whined a weak, miserable sound,
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   but one that gave Corlin a rush of joy.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   Storm's tail thumped feebly on the turf.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   Chapter 4.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   Corbin
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Corbin walked through a world of grey,
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   dimly aware that he was staggering,
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   close to a wide and dark river.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   There was a splash and a wide ripple,
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   the hint of something large and sinuous in its depths.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   Bloated dark clouds boiled above him,
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   flickering with lightning,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   and black shapes winged through them with an occasional gleam of chainmail and iron.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   This is the other world.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   His knee throbbed and a pain spasm through his chest with every in-drawn breath.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   He fixed his eyes on the ground before him,
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   concentrated on each step.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   There had always been an element of the other world that calmed him,
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   a serenity that settled within him that gave him a sense of strength and hope.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   But this time was different.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   There was something frayed about the peacefulness.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   It felt false.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   Something lurked at the fringes of his mind,
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   trying, needing to be remembered.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   When next he looked up,
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   the river was flowing into a valley,
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   cliffs rearing up by the side of him tall and forbidding.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   The head of him, the river spilt into a lake.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   Vibrant colour was seeping into the landscape with every step into the valley,
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   the grass grew greener, the river bluer, as if colour was seeping up from the rock below.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   I know this place.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   Have been here before.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   The green valley and the lake of deep blue.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   Gentle waves lapped against the shore.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   A sound drew Corbin's eye towards the lake's heart,
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   a splash and ripples as if a stone had been thrown into water.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   His memory prodded at him and his eyes wandered back to the lake shore,
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   searching for something else and then he saw it.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   The red leafed maple that he had once sat beneath.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   Without thinking he made his way to it and sat down his back to the trunk.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   Everything was still.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   No breeze to stir the grass or leaves, no harm of insects.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   The silence was oppressive.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   And then, high above, like a heartbeat, there was a beat of wings.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   He glanced up through the lattice of leaf and bark and saw a figure silhouetted against the clouds,
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   human-like, a spear clutched in one hand, broad white feathered wings powering it through the air.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   The Ben-Elim.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   Mical.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   Mical.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   Then, like an avalanche, he remembered.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   Mical, in the great hall of dressill, telling Corbin about the deception of the Ben-Elim,
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   how the prophecy was nothing more than a strategy, a trick to force Azeroth's hand, to lure Caledus and the Catachem to dressill.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   That the bright star and black sun were an invention, fabricated to snare Azeroth in the trap of his own making.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   A sound strategy, maybe, in the great war between Ben-Elim and Catachem, the faithful and the fallen,
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   apart from the fact that it used people's lives like pawns on a throwboard.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   My dar's life, my mams, so many others.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   Rage swept through him, vamed with betrayal at the memory of Mical's confession.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   He remembered resisting the urge to strike Mical, then leaving, knowing his rage was at the boundaries of his control,
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   and had ended up sitting upon a hill in the forest.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   He had sat there a long time, contemplating Mical's words, trying to make some sense of what he would mean for the future.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   And then the jot-on giants had come.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   Ill dair, their warlord, Slayer of Tuckle, Gar's dar.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   Images flicked through his mind, a bare, roaring, spittle spraying from its red moor, running, foliage whipping his face,
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   the thunder of the bear's pursuit, the wounds to his knee and chest, a spear piercing storm, a river, ice cold water.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   Storm howling as giants had dragged him away from her side.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   Storm.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   Pang shuddered through Corbin's chest as if someone were gripping his heart, squeezing and twisting it.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   He couldn't breathe.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   His sorrow was a physical thing that crushed the air from his lungs, he staggered towards the lake, dropping to his knees at the water's edge.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   Even as he did so, more memories flooded his mind than unstoppable wave of Drasil,
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   the frantic blowing of horns and sound of battle that had drifted up to him.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   Images of his loved ones swam before his eyes, Corbin, Gar, Cohen, Daff and Farrell, Brenner so many others.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   Do they still live?
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   Who was attacking Drasil?
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   dimly he became aware of movement.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   Before him, the water of the lake started to shift and foam, something rising from the depths.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   The shape appeared, water cascading and masking for a moment, the creature within.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   Then a man was striding from the lake with water dripping from the dark cloak that trailed him like seaweed.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   He approached Corbin.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   An interested, amicable smile upon his face.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   His skin was gray-mottled and vamed like a dead thing.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   His hair was black and slick as oil.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   A black scabbarded sword hung at his hip.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   "Well," the man said.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   "It's not often that I get visitors."
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   His voice was liquid, flowing like a shallow stream over shingle.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   "What brings you to my home?"
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   "I, I've been here before," Corbin said.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   "I know, I've watched you."
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   "This is the other world," Corbin said.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   "It is, and this lake, this tree, this valley," the dark head man said with the wave of his hands, "our mine."
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   He shrugged.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   "Water dripping from his hair."
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   "Are you?"
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   "Ben Ellum," Corbin asked.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   The man laughed.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   A damp exhalation.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   "Those pompous fools, no, though to my shame we are related."
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   "Cardachim," Corbin asked fearful.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   "Hardly," the man snorted.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   "Those fawning debauch deviance.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   Do I look like one of them?"
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   "No," Corbin admitted.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   "Well, then, I am just me."
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   "Virefon."
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   He lifted his hands, held one up to the sky, displayed his fingers.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   Corbin saw that they were webbed like a frog's feet.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   "You are from the world of flesh, are you not?"
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   The man said.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   Corbin nodded whereily.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   "And what is your name?
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   Creature of flesh."
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   Virefon asked him, leaning in uncomfortably close.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   His breath washing over Corbin moist and full of rot.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   Corbin did not want to tell him.
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   "I'm going to go now," he said, standing.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   "I don't want him to be far away from his creature."
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   "I don't think so," Virefon sighed.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   "I think we should continue this conversation somewhere a little more."
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   "Private."
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   Corbin backed away, turning to leave.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   Something grabbed his ankle.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   Looking down he saw that it was a tendril of Virefon's cloak, flexing like a grasping limb.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   It wrapped itself around his leg as Virefon walked back towards the lake then,
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   looking strength, the cloak pulled tight and started dragging Corbin.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   For a moment, Corbin was too shocked to resist, but then he scrambled back,
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   yanking at his ankle, hand grasping for his sword.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   "Come on, don't Dali!"
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   Virefon called over his shoulder as he reached the lake.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   He walked in, sinking rapidly.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   The cloak seemed to split, to flow, forming a myriad of strands,
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   reaching up to Corbin, each one contracting around his ankles, wrists and throats.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   Then he was being pulled down to the lake shore,
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   trust like a fly in a spider's web, into the water.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   Panic filled him as his head sank beneath the surface,
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   and he struggled desperately, straining Vain's bulging muscles, screaming.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   With a sinewed tearing effort, he pulled one arm free,
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   and then he was bursting out of the water, hoisted into the air, dangling before the creature,
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   held up by his dark cloak that looked now more like a squirming nest of snakes.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   Corbin gasped for breath, ripping at the cloak strands and closing him to little effect.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   Virefon regarded him with a cold fascination.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   "Tell me your name," Virefon said, anger swelling in his voice the crash of waves upon rocks.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   "Let me go!" Corbin grunted through his constricted chest.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   "You have trespassed here," disturbed my rest.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   Virefon said wetly as he pulled Corbin closer.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   "In return, I will have some answers, and then, after I may see how you taste."
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   A wave of found breath in golfed Corbin making his stomach lurch.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   "What are you?" Corbin coughed.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   "I am Virefon," the creature said.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   His mouth opening wide, seeming to grow before Corbin's eyes wider and wider,
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth glistening and dripping with mucus.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   "Eater of souls!"
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   There was a whistling sound, and a spear slammed into Virefon's cloak, piercing it.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   Virefon screamed as Ben Elim swept down from the sky.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   More spears flew stabbing into Virefon's body.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   His yell deepened into a bellow of pain and rage,
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   and Corbin found himself thrown to the ground as the creature turned its attention to its attackers.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   Then hands were grasping Corbin, and he was hoisted into the air again.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   There was a Ben Elim eye, the side of him surging, skywards, their wings beating hard.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   Within heartbeats, the conflict in the lake was below them.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   Virefon and his living cloak sinking into the water,
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   one strand coiling around a Ben Elim, dragging it beneath the surface.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   The Ben Elim's scream cut short as the water closed over its head.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   They flew higher, following the course of a winding valley,
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   twisting and turning amongst peaks and sheer cliffs,

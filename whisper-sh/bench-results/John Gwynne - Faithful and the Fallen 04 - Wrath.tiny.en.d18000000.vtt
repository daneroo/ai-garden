00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.020
 Roth, Book 4 of the Faithful and the Fallen, by John Gwynn, read by Damien Lynch.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:17.160
 Roth and vengeance poured, John Milton, Paradise Lost.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.000
 Chapter 1 There it is.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 The year 1144 of the Age of Exiles, Hound moon.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 There it is, fell through the night air, weightless.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 He caught glimpses of the Tower of Bricken.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Caledas is still smoldering outline at the window, then below, the river coming up to meet him.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 He slammed into the water, the cold shocking the breath out of him.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 He panicked, disorientated, realizing he didn't know which way was up.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 All about him was darkness and ice.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Then something grabbed his hair, and he was surging upwards, breaking through the water in a burst of spray,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 and saw Alsion's pale broad face staring back at him.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 "They will come hunting for us," the giant shouted over the roar of the river, as the current gripped them,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 sweeping them away from the thunder of warriors' feet crossing the bridge.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 "Let the water take us far from them."

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Verida saw the sense of that, though his hands and feet were already numbing from the cold.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 He put some effort into swimming, speeding his way from Bricken, from Caledas, from the Qadashim.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 The thought still jolted him like a blow.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 They turned a bend in the river, and the fortress was gone, darkness in folding them.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 The soft weak sheen of dawn's gray light filtered down through the lattice of branches above, as Verida's met Alsion's gaze,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 an unspoken agreement passing between them, as they both headed for the river back.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 It was harder going, swimming across the current, and Verida's realized how exhausted his body was,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 but eventually he felt silt beneath his feet, his hands grasping at reeds as he pulled himself out of the water,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 and flopped onto his back, gasping, his limbs feeling lead-filled.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Turning, he saw Alsion on the bank.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Thirty of forty paces up river from him, staggering wearily towards him before he slumped down beside him with a groan,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 water dripping from his drooping moustache.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 "Thank you," Alsion said.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 "For what?"

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 "Everything.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Most of all, for helping my family escape Bricken's dungeons.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 His wife and bern.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 How long has he gone without seeing them?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 And what must he have suffered, knowing they were Caledus and Lycosy's prisoners?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 And for destroying Caledus's effigy of me?"

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 Alsion continued, "You have set me free."

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 He gave a shudder, followed by a smile.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 "A shadow is gone from my soul.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 I feel reborn."

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 "If you mean you feel weak as a newborn bern,"

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Veridus muttered as he emptied his boot of water and tried to pull it back on.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 "Then I feel the same."

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 "That is not what I mean," the giant rumbled,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 regarding Veridus with serious eyes.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 "You set Rainer and Tane free."

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 "You set me free."

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 "I owe you a deck beyond all imagining."

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 "You are in no debt to me," Veridus said.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 "I kick the effigy's into the fire on impulse,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 not really knowing what they were or what power they held over you."

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 "But you suspected."

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 "I."

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 "Something that Fidele said."

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 He thought of Nithair's mother, hoped that she had made it to freedom

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 along with his brother, Krelis, McIn, and Halbin.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 And your wife and son, I set them free because it was the right thing to do."

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 "There was no other choice."

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 "Ah, but there was true heart.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 There always is."

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 Veridus shrugged.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 "There is no debt between us."

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 "You are my friend."

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 "One of my only friends," it has turned out.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 His thoughts swept bitterly to Nithair,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 and the confession and revelations that had stunned Veridus.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 He remembered Calidus's confession.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 That Nithair had slain Aquilis, his own father.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Anger and shame twisted through him.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 "There had been so many signs."

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 "How can I have been deceived for so long?"

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 "I am a fool."

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 "How long?"

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 Veridus asked him.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 "How long have you been Calidus's prisoner?"

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 Alcyon smiled with it.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 "Sixteen years."

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 "That is a long time."

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 "It is."

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Alcyon clenched his fists, knuckles cracking.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 "I should have killed him."

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 "To be fair, we both tried hard on that count.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 I put a knife in his belly, threw him in a fire,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 and he shattered his chest with a wall hammer.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 "Cadoshim are hard to kill.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 I'd have to agree.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 Can he be killed?"

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 "Maybe taking his head."

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 "That is how the others are slain.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Others?"

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 Alcyon said to the question in Veridus's eyes.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 "The Geeha," Veridus muttered, shaking his head.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 "I've been so blind."

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 "You trusted your king and your friend."

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Alcyon shrugged.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 "There are worse failings to have."

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 "Are there?"

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 "I have dedicated my life to a lie."

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 "They both sat in silence, water dripping from clothes and hair."

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 "What now?"

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 Veridus said to himself.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 "It feels as if my whole life has been dedicated to an affair in his cause."

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 "What do I do now?"

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Alcyon regarded him gravely, and poked his chest with a thick finger.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 "What does your heart tell you?"

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 "I will not trust it."

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 "Look, Veridus led me thus far."

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Veridus said, "Sowling.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Your eyes are open now."

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 Veridus sucked in a deep breath, felt exhaustion seeping through him.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 "What would you do?"

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 He asked the giant.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 "Find my kin, my reina, and tain."

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 He smiled as he said their names.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 "Kin."

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 "My father is slain."

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 "That is my brother, Ector."

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 "Only Krellus is left."

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Suddenly he was desperate to see his older brother.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 "Find our kin," he echoed.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 "A good place to start."

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 "Something squawked."

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 A handful of wood pigeons suddenly bursting from the trees and flapping noisily overhead.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 "We should move."

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 "We need cover."

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 "I."

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 "To the trees."

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 Veridus said, as he stood suppressing a groan.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 They were halfway across the clearing when Alcyon stopped abruptly, staring back along the riverbank.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 Forms appeared around a distant bend on the track.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 Shadows in the half-light that forms canopy created.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 Black shadows with curved swords sheath across their backs.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 "Kado Shem."

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 Alcyon growled.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 Veridus counted at least seven of them, moving quickly, a low-pin ground-eating paste like a pack of wolfen.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 They were spread in a half-circle between the riverbank and the tree-line.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 They are hunting us.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 They have been running all night long following the river in search of our trail.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 One of the figures paused, the others rippling to a halt about it.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 It lifted its head as if tasting the air, then gave an allulating howl and leapt forwards a new energy in its stride.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 They've caught our scent.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Veridus felt a jolt of fear.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 He'd faced giants, dregs, war bands, but somehow knowing that the deans of the other world were hunting him sent a cold shock of fear tingling through his veins.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 Kalidus filled his mind, an image of the man he had thought Counsellor and ally emerging from the fire in Brickann's tower, flaying reaved and snarling.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 He has corrupted Nefair and has deceived me for so long.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 He is the author of this evil.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 Fear morphed into a cold rage and he reached for his sword, lips twisting.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 Move.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 Alcyon grunted and broke into a run.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 Veridus resisted for a moment, inexplicably wanting to stand and flank these creatures, but Alcyon dragged him along and in a heartbeat, they were only a few strides from the tree-line.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 He realized the giant had no weapon.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 No war hammer or battle-like strapped across his back, no sword or dagger at his hip.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 They crashed through the first layer of undergrowth and were immediately enveloped by a twilight world of shadow and thorn.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 Alcyon forged ahead, grunting as branches snapped upon his rock-like torso, thorns whipping at Veridus, vines tangling about his boots.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 For it seemed a long time, Veridus only heard his own heart thumping the rasp of his breath, the thud of Alcyon's feet.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 Then there were sounds behind him, faint at first, like the rustle of wind through foliage, but soon louder, keening cries were floating about him.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 They splashed through a string, something sinuous slivered beneath Veridus's feet, making him stumble.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 "They are almost upon us," he gasped to Alcyon.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 Better to turn and fight, hold a sword in my fist than die running.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 "I know," the giant said, turning, chest-heaving.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 Veridus drew his sword as they put their backs to a huge tree, the stream before them, and waited.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 Forms flitted through the gloom, emerging from a curtain of shadows and thick foliage.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 One was a long way ahead of the others, clothed in the dark male of the Jihar, pale-skinned, dark veins making a tapestry of its flesh.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 It saw them and leapt the stream, arms reaching for Veridus, not even bothering to draw its sword.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 "Remember, you must take their heads," Alcyon grunted, as he pushed away from the tree, hurling himself into the oncoming catachim with bone-crushing power.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 The two fell to the ground.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 Veridus hurtled forwards, sword raised, hacking two-handed at the catachim's arm.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Its hand spinning away, blood like oil, pumping languidly from the stump.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 Then the two forms were rolling together again.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 Alcyon ground in pain, then he was on his knees.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 Arms wrapped about the catachim's torso, pinning its arms at its side.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 The creature's head rived, veins bulging as it strained to break free.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 Alcyon's face turning purple with the effort, his locked fingers slowly pulling apart.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 "What are you waiting for?" the giant rasped.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 And Veridus swung his sword, chopping into the creature's neck.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 Dark blood spurted from the half-severed neck, the catachim's screeching with fury.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 Alcyon roared with the strain of holding the creature.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 Veridus ranged his sword free, and swung again.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 The catachim's head flew through the air landing with a splash in the stream.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 Its body slumped, legs drumming as Alcyon fell away and rolled clear.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 A black eye-core-like mist flowed from the catachim's neck, hissing and swirling, gathering above its body,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 forming a human shape with tattered wings of smoke spread about it and red eyes glowing like

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 colds at its heart.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 Veridus stared.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 Frozen.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 It screamed savagely, then it was melting away, torn and dispersed by a slight breeze.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 "What the hell?" Veridus gasped.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 "Down!" Alcyon yelled, as he surged up from the ground, a fist slamming into the jaw

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 of a leaping catachim, hurling its spinning into the undergrowth.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 Almost as soon as it hit the ground, it was back on its feet, twisting like a feral cat.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 Veridus hefted his sword, spread his legs to meet the impact, and then something crunched into his side, sending him flying through the air another catachim's arms locked around his waist.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 He caught a glimpse of Alcyon's standing, catachim's swarming upon him, then Veridus was slamming into the ground.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 Pain exploded in his shoulder, and his sword skitted away.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 He rolled, punched at his attacker, for a moment staring into its black, soulless eyes, then they were sliding into the stream that catachim beneath him,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 his hands fastening about its neck, squeezing, seeking to crush the life from the black-eyed abomination.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 It bucked and kicked like a wild stallion, thrashing a tempest amidst the streamwater, but Veridus would not let go.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 He felt its strength ebbing, some of its vitality fading, then hands gripped him from behind, dragging him backwards, his fingers slipping as he was hauled to the bank.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 Another catachim stood over him, drawing its sword from its back as the one from the stream splashed into view.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 He rolled and saw a handful of catachim circling Alcyon, who had fallen to one knee, the giant bleeding from a dozen wounds.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 Veridus tried to drag himself through the mud towards his friend.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 Another catachim was held in Alcyon's arms, he had one hand gripping its jaw, the other wrapped about its chest.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 With a savage wrench, Alcyon heaved.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 Veridus heard the catachim's neck break, then the sound of flesh tearing, Alcyon screaming his defiance as he ripped the catachim's head from its shoulders.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 He flung the corpse to the ground as the black mist boiled from the dead creature's wound.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 The searing pain lance through Veridus' leg, a catachim blade scoring along his thigh.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 He dropped to the ground, looked back at the two catachim on the stream bank.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 They were following him, toying with him.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 The one with a drawn sword slashed his blade across Veridus' uphill forearm, and you cut burning like fire.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 "Think, will, bleed you a while," the catachim said, layering with pale lips.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 "Pay you back for the chase you've led us."

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 It should not end like this.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 Frustration gave Veridus a last surge of strength, and he rolled to his feet, pushed himself upright.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 The catachim before him grinned, then paused, cocking its head to one side.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 The figures burst out of the gloom.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 Veridus' hopes rose in then fell, as he saw the newcomers were dressed in black breastplates with silver eagles on their chests.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 Eagle guard.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 No doubt said by Nefair to make sure that his monsters complete their task.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 10.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 12.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 15 more men, one of them tall and wide.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 Veridus blinked.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 Something familiar.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Well met, little brother, the big man bellowed, grinning wildly.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 A moment's confusion followed swiftly by elation.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 "Crellas!"

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 Then Crellas and his men were attacking the catachim, Crellas taking their head in one great swing of his longsword.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 Another warrior swept into view.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 This one not dressed as a man of tenor brow, but gripping a knife in each hand.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 He joined Crellas, and together they attacked the catachim before Veridus.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 14.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 Macquine and Crellas.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 22.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 Nefair

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 Nefair stood in the great hall of Drasil, and stared at the giant skeletonite's throne.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 The bones of the ribcage surrounded a thick shafted spear, the wood, dark and pale vain.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 Only a hint of black iron of the blade visible.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 The rest buried in the great tree of Drasil.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 So that is scald.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 High king of the giants, and that is the starstone spear.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 Scald.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 The last man to rule a united empire where giants and men live together in peace.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 Will I be the next to unite this shattered world?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 The skeleton was mottled yellow and brown, ancient.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 The brow of the skull broad and thick eye sockets, black holes that seemed to stare

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 at the fair, questioning him.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 Are you worthy?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 Are you capable?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 He sighed.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 History shall be my judge, nothing and no one else.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 The hand touched his shoulder.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 Cesar was standing at the head of three-score eagle guard.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 The young warrior had been recently promoted to high captain of the fair's war band,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 now that Veridis was gone.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 Ah, there it is.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 Are you dead or alive, old friend?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 It does not seem right that you are not beside me to share in this great victory.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 He had been informed of Veridis' betrayal.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 His attempt on Caledus' life and he and Altheon's escape.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 Veridis.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 How could you abandon me?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 Break your oath to me.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 He looked at the white scars on the palm of his hand.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 One of them made as a blood oath of brotherhood to Veridis,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 on a moonlit hillside in Tenabrell.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 It felt like a lifetime ago.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 Words and promises spoken by different people.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 My king, Cesar said.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 It is Caledus.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 He asks for you.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 Nithair looked back at the skeleton one last time,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 then turned and strode through the huge chamber.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 The dead were still being cleared from the battle of the day before.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 Bloods staying the stone floor.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 Mounds of corpses lay in stinking piles.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 Hundreds of them.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 Caddishim, Jihah, Vinthalan, Eagleguard,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 Bonothee Giants, many others.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 The cost of taking Drasil had been high,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 higher than he would have imagined considering that the element of surprise had been on their side.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 But victory is victory.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 The fortress is ours, the back of our enemy, broken.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 Though many had escaped, reports were coming in of pitched battles still being fought beyond the walls of Drasil.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 Nithair glanced at his right as he passed an open trap door as wide as the gates of Jerelin,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 and the dark stain of blood on the stone before it.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 My Caled's blood.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 The Ben-Elim's head now adorned a spear set in the ground of the courtyard before the gates of Drasil.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 It was not alone.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 But what of Corbin, their bright star?

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 Where is he?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 He glared mistrustfully into the yawning dark of the tunnel, knew that Michael had chosen to stand and fight there to gain time for many who escaped into the tunnel.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 But Corbin, one of them.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 There had been no reports of Corbin being seen during the battle.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 Had even been here.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 It had been a long night, and Nithair felt a greater wear in a settling upon him than he had ever known before.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 Caesar snapped an order behind him, an eagle guard spread to either side, forming a protective column.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 Drasil is not yet secure, Caesar said, and replied to Nithair's inquiring look.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 The courtyard also bore the signs of yesterday's battle.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 Bodies scattered all about flies buzzing, the metallic aroma of blood everywhere.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 For an instant, Nithair thought he saw a wolf and carved tugging at the leg of a dead caddish him.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 But looking back, realised it was a small white furred dog.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 They turned a corner in a street, and the fair glimpsed the towering outer walls of Drasil beyond the layers of stone buildings latticed with thick branches.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 This is a truly remarkable place.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 Branches soared above him as thick as towers with buildings of stone and iron wrapped about them bound tighter than leather armor.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 It looks almost alive.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 The tree, the bones, the fortress, its flesh.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 The rasp of a sword drawn from its scabbard drew his attention, and he glimpsed the black clothed warrior hurtling from the shadows of a doorway.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 Probably, Caesar was yelling as more dark figures emerged, iron and glinting.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 The eagle-guard moved.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 Shields thudding together around the fair of scuring his view.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 Blood sprayed, spattering the fair's face as an eagle-guard before him collapsed.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 A black clothed gihar slipped into the gap carved in the shield wall, surging toward the fair.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 The fair drew his sword, fear and rage his constant companions igniting within him.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 The shouts and screams a battle faded, his world contracting to the gihar warrior before him.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 A woman, her dark-skinned face all sharp bones almost fragile looking.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 Truth and courage, she yelled, curved sword rising.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 There was an explosion of sparks as their weapons met, the power of the gihar's strike making the tendons of his wrist shriek, shattering on into his arm and shoulder.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 He pushed forwards, knowing to retreat, was to die, tried to move within her guard, use his short sword where her longer blade would hinder her.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 They collided, limbs tangling as both crashed to the ground, wrestling, punching, kicking and biting at each other as they rolled back and forth across the stone street with a battle raging all about them.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 The gihar struck a glancing blow that made his vision blur, then her knee crunched into his groin and he slumped, pain exploding, pulsing through him in savage waves, draining his strength.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 She pulled herself free, and half rose as he coughed into the cold stone, tried to rise, knew if he didn't, he was dead.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 Fear and rage sparked inside him, sent new energy coursing through his veins. "I'll not die here."

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 The gihar stood over him, sword raised, her eyes bright with victory.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 Then a form crashed into her, throwing her to the ground.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 She started to rise and a boot slammed into her jaw, sent her crashing back down.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 The figure was blurred, a buzzing clown swirling about it.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 Hands gripped him and pulled him upright, says his concerned face appeared, blood shooting from a long cut across his forehead.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 Nefair looked past him, saw his rescuer pull a sword from a scabbard upon its back and raise it over the unconscious gihar.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 A kadashim.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 "No," Nefair called. The figure's head turned to look at him, the buzzing cloud parting.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 "Flies," Nefair realized, recognizing the kadashim.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 "No, Legion. I want her alive."

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 The kadashim regarded him for a moment with cold black eyes.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 "Better, dead," it said. "I want her alive," Nefair snapped.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 "Calyters may have questions."

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 "Dead, after, then," the kadashim said, then sheathing its sword.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 "Calyters, once you."

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 The flesh of its face are neck rippled, seeming to move its own accord as if something were locked within trying to get out.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 About them, the battle seemed almost done.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 Nefair scanned the street, countingly a score of his eagle guard dead to five or six of their gihar attackers.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 This part of Jassel is supposed to have been cleared, he snulled.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 "How did they get in here?"

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 He looked down at the unconscious gihar's form at Legion's feet.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 "Bring her," Nefair said, as he marched away.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 As Nefair entered the courtyard before Jassel's gates,

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 he heard a rumbling growl reverberate from one of the many stables that edged the courtyard.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 He looked fondly at the doors that contained his drag.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 "Calyters stood before the closed gates of Jassel,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 to either side of him where a host of spears driven into the ground,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 most of them adorned with a head."

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 The handful of Vinfallen warriors were planting new spears into the ground,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 while behind them, Kalyashim prowled into the courtyard's shadows.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 Before Kalyters knelt a ragged group of people, bound at wrist and ankle,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 over 300 prisoners from yesterday's battle.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 Above them, eagle guards stood upon Jassel's walls.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 My warriors.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 They were easily the best discipline troops amongst those that had stormed Jassel.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 The Kalyashim and many of Lycuss's Vinfallen were involved in the pursuit of their scattered enemy out beyond Jassel's walls.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 But Nothair suspected that most by far were ranging throughout the forest, looting and drinking.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 The Kalyashim were doing other things, such as eating their victims.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 Lycuss was standing behind Kalyters.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 A dozen Vinfallen ranged about him, hard-looking men, bodies lean and muscular, skin, weathered and scarred.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 Lycuss lifted a water skin to his mouth and took a long drink.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 I'd wade to it's not water that he's drinking.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 The Vinfallen saw him approaching and nodded, greeting.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 Nothair hid his disgust.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 Him and my mother.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 Ah, Nothair.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 Kalyters said.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 He raised an eyebrow at the blood on the fair's face, then saw Legion dragging the Gehar warrior across the courtyard by her ankle.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 Kalyters, Nothair said, with a dip of his head.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 His old counselor was not looking his best.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 Part of his face was burned, charcoal black and peeling.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 Silver hair was growing in tufts from patches on his head, elsewhere cinged to stubble or burned clear.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 It would appear that the streets of Jassel are not yet cleared of our enemy, Nothair said sourly.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 As Legion dumped the Gehar warrior in front of Kalyters.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 She groaned, pushing herself to her knees as Legion's hand clamped on her shoulder holding her before Kalyters.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 "What is your name, child?" Kalyters asked, regarding her with his cold eyes.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 She spat blood at Kalyters's feet and gloured up at him.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 "Eelter," the Gehar said, "and I am no child."

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 "Well, Eelter, I shall ask you the same question that I have just put to your comrades.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 Where is Corbin?"

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 "You will see him soon enough," a voice said from amongst the prisoners.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 "He will come for you."

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 "And when he does," said Eelter, as she turned her head to look from Kalyters to Nothair and like us, "he will kill you all."

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 "He is a boy, a puppet, your eel master is already slain," Kalyters said angrily, sweeping her hand towards Michael's head.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 "You are wrong," Eelter said.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 "Corbin is our lord. He slew your best, Sumer, in single combat. We all saw it. He will do the same to you."

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 "Sumor," Kalyters frowned. "I saw his head decorating your gates."

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 "Corbin killed him," the prisoners voiced called out again, one vaguely familiar to Nothair.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 "Your figure straightened amongst the captives, black hair hanging lank about her face."

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 "He took Sumer's head, and he will take yours too."

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 "Ah," Cohen.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 "I want nothing more than for him to come and try," Kalyters said with a sigh, his expression mocking, but Nothair glimpsed something else in his eyes.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 "Doubt?"

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 "But so far, he does not seem inclined to do so," Kalyters continued.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 "Perhaps a message would have speed him to us."

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 "He looked to the Kalishim."

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 "Lijian, choose one prisoner and impale them upon a spear," he ordered.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 "Lijian drabbed Cohen and pulled her struggling towards a spear, Nothair," Kalyters said, with a wave of his hand.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 "Lijian grabbed another prisoner.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 He was a man of his ill-tiered by the look of him.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 The Kalishim hoisted him effortlessly into the air and brought him down slowly upon the upright spear.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 Then the screaming began.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 When it was over, the prisoner was skewered like a squirrel ready for the cookfire.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 He was writhing upon the spear, blood pooling about his feet, screaming himself to oblivion.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 Nothair resisted the urge to cover his ears.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 "On your feet," Kalyters said to Elta.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 "Go and tell Koroban what is happening to his followers what I am doing.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 Tell him I will not stop until he has faced me."

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 Lijian pushed her stumbling forwards as with a rumble.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 The gates opened.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 She looked back once and then ran.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 The gates slamming behind her.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 Kalyters barked in order and the remaining captives were led away.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 Koroban caught Nothair's eye as she walked in line, hatred pouring from her.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 "We must talk soon," Kalyters said to Nothair and like us.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 "Hi son, in the great hole."

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 Then he was striding away.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 Like us raised an eyebrow and offered Nothair his water skin.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 "Without thinking," Nothair took it and drank, then coughed almost choking on the contents.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 "Is that?"

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 "Meade," Lyca's finished for him.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 Filling their dozen wagons with barrels full of the stuff.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 Nothair handed it back to him and Lyca's walked away, chuckling to himself.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 He's been thal and following him.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 Nothair headed for the wide stairs that scaled Drassil's walls and climbed to the top.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 Stopping above the great gates where he stared out of the world beyond.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 A wide, plain, circled the fortress, clear blue sky bathing the ground in sunshine before

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 the great trees are formed, blotted it from view.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 He caught a glimpse of Illta just before she disappeared into the tree line.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 Behind him, he heard the footsteps of Caesar and his eagle guard stopping a respectful distance away.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 The screams of the impaled in the courtyard were much fainter up here, fading to a pathetic muelling.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 He wished he would just die.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 "How have I allowed myself to come to this?"

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 "It is for the greater good.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 For me to win the war, Corbin must die.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 To bring peace to the banished lands, Corbin must die."

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 He felt his resolve stir, but still the screens wormed their way into his head,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 reminding him of other battles, other deaths in the name of this great cause.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 And now I follow the path of Qadoshim, of demons, of Asroth himself.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 He remembered Qadoshim's words to him in Murias, so persuasive.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 "It had all been so logical when Qadoshim explained it made sense of the alliances, the lies, deception upon deception heaped in a great pile.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 But the truth is simpler, a voice seemed to whisper inside his mind.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 "Deep down, he knew."

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 It was more basic when all was stripped away.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 Caled as his persuasive arguments and philosophical debates on good and evil, right and wrong,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 the abstract meanings that were attached to names.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 Politics, power struggles, who deserved what?

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 The honest answer was much simpler than any of those meandering debates,

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 and one that had been clearly reinforced by his brief struggle with the Jihad warrior before him.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 "I don't want to lose."

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 Chapter 3

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 Corbin

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 Corbin sat with her back to a tree, staring into the dawn gloom of form,

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 absolutely twirling a knife between her fingers.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 Behind her were the sleeping forms of three score or serve the survivors within she had fled Dressell.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 Amongst them was Brenner, grey hair poking from beneath her cloak,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 beside her the bolts of feral and leaf curled close together.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 She glimpsed the Jihad, Akar, standing guard on the far side of their camp.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 Exhaustion halved at the fringes of her consciousness, and in so many ways it would be wonderful to lose herself

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 and the nothingness of sleep.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 But she couldn't.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 Her mind was reeling, a whirlwind of grief, fear and rage as fractured moments of the previous day played out in her mind's eye.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 Out of them all, though, everything kept returning to one thought circling.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 Where is Corbin?

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 The fog of tiredness crept upon her again.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 A relentless assault, but she knew that sleep would not come, the shock and horror of yesterday's battle was still too present.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 There was a soft footfall from behind, and a figure came to stand beside her.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 Gah.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 The lord of the Jihad looked at her, lines of worry etched upon his usually unreadable face.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 He was clothed in a shirt of dark chain-mail, splattered with grime and blood.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 His curved sword sheathed across his back, a single-bladed, throwing axe, hanging at his belt.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 Even he was not free of injury.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 A blood-stained bandage was tied around his forehead.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 Storm is with him.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 Gah said.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 As if he could read her thoughts.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 There must be his plan to read upon my face as I his.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 Storm.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 That was a measure of comfort.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 Corinne knew that the wolfin was a better guardian than a dozen sheildmen, but still.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 "We will find him," Gah said.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 Corinne had seen the familiar scuff marks of Storm's claws in the tunnel, which was why they had exited at this spot.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 After a brief search, she'd found more tracks, leading to the brow of the slope, but darkness has settled upon them.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 No matter how frustrating, it was pointless to stumble around in the dark.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 But where can Corinne be?

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 He must have heard the din of battle from Drassel, even if he were this far away.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 The thoughts rose unbidden in her mind.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 The one thought she'd refuse to acknowledge throughout the long dark of night.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 What if he is slain?

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 What else could have kept him from returning to Drassel?

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 She felt a worm of fear wriggling through her belly, but refused to consider it.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 He lives.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 He must.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 She nodded, and stood.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 She leaving her knife, a myriad of cuts, bruises, and strains, aching for attention.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 She ignored them all.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 "We need to go," she said.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 "I." Gah agreed.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 He continued to stare at the trapdoor.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 I had hoped that my cow would find us, that he escaped."

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 Corinne remembered her last sight of the Ben-Elim.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 Wielding his sword, two-handed, feet planted before the entrance to the tunnel in Drassel's great hall as they had retreated into its shadows.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 Swayves of blood had surrounded him as he swung his sword in deadly arcs, holding back the enemy, protecting them, purchasing them time to escape.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 He would come by now, if he could.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 Corinne said.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 Gah sighed and nodded.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 Corinne cocked her head, listening, staring down the hill.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 Something was moving in the undergrowth, heading towards the trapdoor.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 Gah saw it too, and without words the two of them separated, slipping into the shadows as they quietly surrounded the intruder.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 Bushes rustled, a twig snapped, and Corinne caught a glimpse of dark hair.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 She knew he wasn't Corinne, even he isn't that clumsy.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 A figure burst from the undergrowth.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 A young man clad in leather and wool, his dark hair, tousled, and a scabbing cut marking his forehead.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 He started at the sight of her, fumbled for a weapon at his belt, his eye is widening.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 "I know you," Corinne said, though she didn't remember his name.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 "Your da is itilius."

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 A competent, unassuming warrior, itilius had been a slave oarsman on a Vinth Island ship.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 The lad nodded.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 His lip trembling.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 "Pax, what are you doing here?"

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 Gah said, stepping silently from the shadows, making the young warrior jump again.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 "You must come quickly."

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 Pax blurted.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 "My da.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 Corbin.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 Giants."

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 "Corbin?"

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 Corinne hissed.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 "I.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 We must go."

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 Tears were spilling down Pax's cheeks now, tracing tracks through blood and grime.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 He stared.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 Corinne froze, feeling as if a fist had just clamped around her heart.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 "I ran."

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 Pax said.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 "He began to shake, an involuntary twitching that quickly became more violent."

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 "Where is Corbin?"

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.960
 Corinne asked, trying to control the panic leaking through her, reaching out to grab the

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.000
 now sobbing boy and shake the sense from him.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 "Hold," Gah said, putting a hand upon her arm.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 "Pax, you must tell us as clearly as you can.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 Where is Corbin and your da?

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 What happened?"

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 "Others were coming down the hill now."

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 Corinne glimpsed daff in colour, a handful of jihad, lathe looming behind them.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 "We heard.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 Fighting.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 New Corbin was out there."

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 Pax began, haltingly.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 "We found him, facing giants and bears."

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 "What?"

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 "But there were no giants in the fair at Dressel."

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 "Dah.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 He threw a spear at a giant.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 Then we all ran.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 We thought we'd lost them.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 Then..."

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 "Go on," Gah said.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 The whole group was gathered around them now, listing in absolute silence.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 "They came from nowhere.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 My da?"

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 He rubbed his eyes, blew out a long breath.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 "They killed my da."

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 Corbin told me to run to fetch help.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 "When did this happen?"

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 Gah asked, not able to keep the urgency from his voice.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 "Yesterday, after his son before, sunset."

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 Pax's face had grown paler as he spoke.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 "Now he looked like a corpse.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 I ran.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 I fell, hit my head."

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 He raised the hand to the cut on his brow.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 "When I came to?"

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 It was dark.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 "I've been trying to find my way since then."

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 "Take us.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 Now," Gah said.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 "I will try."

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 Pax nodded.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 I became lost for a while.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 But I know it was that direction."

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 Gah barked orders and then they were moving.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 Corbin taking the lead with Pax,

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 Gah jogging beside the ladder, steadying hand on his arm.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 Corbin stormed, facing giants.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 Alone.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 Yesterday.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 She sent a silent prayer to Elion,

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 one of many that she had made over the last half day.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 "Let them still live."

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 Corbin was the first to enter the glade.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 At its far end was a sudden ridge,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 and beyond it, the sound of a fast flowing river.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 The smell hit her first.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 The metallic tang of blood and decay.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 Death.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 Flies were buzzing in great clouds

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 about bodies heaped on the floor.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 She counted three giant corpses on the ground,

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 and Attilius pinned to a great oak by a giant's axe.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 She could not see Corbin or storm.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 She ran to the first giant,

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 who was on his back, a hole in his belly,

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 throat cleanly cut,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000
 his wrist bearing the tail tail ripping wounds of the wolfen.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 Corbin moved on,

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 dimly aware of others spilling into the glade behind her,

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 the sound of Pax's sobs as he dropped to his knees before his dark,

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 Gah's presence at her shoulder.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 The other two giants were close together.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 The ground trampled, rutted, dark and still sticky with blood.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 One's throat had been ripped out by storm,

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 the flesh mangled and torn.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 Here's not here, nor storm.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 The relief was a physical thing,

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 though she knew their absence did not mean

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 that they were safe for even alive,

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000
 but it was clear they had fought here and won.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 They slew three giants.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000
 She felt a flush of pride at that feat,

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 knew that it would be a story told around the campfire this very night,

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 adding to the tails that were growing up around Corbin

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 and his wolfen companion.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 The other giant lay upon his front.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 Gah and Corbin tried to turn him over together,

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
 flies buzzed angrily,

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 the huge warrior's dead weight like a boulder.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 Ferrell and Laith joined them,

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 and together they rolled the giant,

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 the stench of corruption and decay,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 wafting up to them as they disturbed the body.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 "He is of the Jotun clan," Laith spat,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 as they stood instead of a dead giant.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 "What are they doing here?"

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 Corlin's eyes were drawn to the glint of leather

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 and iron amidst the congealed blood.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 She bent and wrapped a fist around the hilt of a sword,

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 buried deep in the giant's thigh,

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 angled upwards into its groin.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 He came free with a sucking sound,

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 and she lifted it for them all to see.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 The pommel shaped like a howling wolfen.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 The relief she'd felt fled,

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 replaced by the crushing weight of fear.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 "That's band sword," Dath said, as he joined them.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 Cola, a pace behind him.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 Corlin stared at them a moment,

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
 caught a wave of sympathy for them.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 They'd been weighed less than two nights.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000
 Gah took the sword from her and stared at it.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 "I watched band's dar give him this blade."

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 "In the row and field at Dunkarig," Farrell said,

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 "I remember it."

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000
 "And I," Dath muttered.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
 Cola turned away,

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 her eyes scanning the ground,

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 searching for any sign.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 "He is not here."

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 Storm is not here.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 They escaped, but they did not make their way back to Drasil.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
 "Why?"

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000
 Brenner was on her knees beside the giant.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 The old healer had a file in one hand,

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 a knife in the other that she was using to scrape blood

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 from the trampled grass.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
 One side of Brenner's face was still an angry red,

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 seared by the explosion she had generated

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
 that rocked the chamber and Drasil yesterday.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 Whatever benefit Brenner thought the giant's blood would bring,

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 she was welcome to it.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 As Corlin scanned the rest of the clearing,

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 her eyes caught a patch of crushed grass spattered with blood.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000
 It was close to the edge of the glade,

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
 leading to his sheer drop to the river below.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000
 As if something were dragged,

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000
 she followed the marks and dropped to a crouch,

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 looking down to the river.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000
 Further down she spied a dark smear on a boulder.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 Blood.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000
 They jumped into the river.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 She galled out.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 Gar was first to join her.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 His eyes found the same evidence,

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 and he gripped her wrist.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 After them, he said.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000
 Corlin led the way,

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 running along the ridge that shadowed the river,

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 twisting around thick-rooted trees in dense vegetation.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000
 Her eyes flitting between the path she was navigating

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 and the banks of the river.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000
 Rounding a sharp bend in the path,

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000
 she suddenly saw a shape lying on a grassy verge,

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000
 firm atted, and bloodstained.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 Her heart stopped.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
 Storm.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 She skidied to a halt on the ridge above the wolfen,

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 her part of her mind noticing large boot prints in the grass.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 In a spray of dirt,

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000
 she scrambled over the edge,

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 clinging to root and vine as she made her way down to the river bank.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000
 Storm lay still as stone,

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 and she was covered in blood a huge wound was visible above her shoulder.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 Corlin crouched, too scared to touch her,

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 not wanting to confirm what her eyes were telling her.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
 Stifling tears,

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 she remembered the first time she had seen Storm,

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000
 when she had threatened to turn the wolfen into a cloak.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 Even then, she had seen the bond between Corbin

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 and his faithful and vigilant shadow.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 Since then, she had developed her own bond with the wolfen,

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 more like a sword brother to her than a mere animal.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 As guard joined her,

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 she tentatively reached out her hand and laid it upon Storm's body.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000
 She felt nothing.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 No.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 Please, Elion above.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
 She screwed her eyes shut tight,

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 pressed harder,

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000
 flattening her palm against Storm's deep chest,

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 willing her hands to feel the movement of life,

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 a drawn breath, the pumping of Storm's heart.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000
 With every moment, her hopes faded,

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.000
 a bleakness taking hold inside spreading through her like ink through water.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000
 And then, she felt it.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000
 A flicker, a heartbeat deep within the cavern of Storm's broad chest.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000
 Corlin opened her eyes and saw Storm's amber gaze regarding her.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
 The wolfen whined a weak, miserable sound,

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000
 but one that gave Corlin a rush of joy.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000
 Storm's tail thumped feebly on the turf.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:07.000
 Chapter 4.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 Corbin

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
 Corbin walked through a world of grey,

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 dimly aware that he was staggering,

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000
 close to a wide and dark river.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 There was a splash and a wide ripple,

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000
 the hint of something large and sinuous in its depths.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
 Bloated dark clouds boiled above him,

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
 flickering with lightning,

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 and black shapes winged through them with an occasional gleam of chainmail and iron.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000
 This is the other world.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 His knee throbbed and a pain spasm through his chest with every in-drawn breath.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000
 He fixed his eyes on the ground before him,

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.000
 concentrated on each step.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000
 There had always been an element of the other world that calmed him,

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000
 a serenity that settled within him that gave him a sense of strength and hope.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 But this time was different.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 There was something frayed about the peacefulness.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
 It felt false.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000
 Something lurked at the fringes of his mind,

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000
 trying, needing to be remembered.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000
 When next he looked up,

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000
 the river was flowing into a valley,

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000
 cliffs rearing up by the side of him tall and forbidding.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000
 The head of him, the river spilt into a lake.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000
 Vibrant colour was seeping into the landscape with every step into the valley,

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:29.000
 the grass grew greener, the river bluer, as if colour was seeping up from the rock below.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 I know this place.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000
 Have been here before.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000
 The green valley and the lake of deep blue.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000
 Gentle waves lapped against the shore.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000
 A sound drew Corbin's eye towards the lake's heart,

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000
 a splash and ripples as if a stone had been thrown into water.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000
 His memory prodded at him and his eyes wandered back to the lake shore,

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000
 searching for something else and then he saw it.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.000
 The red leafed maple that he had once sat beneath.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 Without thinking he made his way to it and sat down his back to the trunk.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000
 Everything was still.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.000
 No breeze to stir the grass or leaves, no harm of insects.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000
 The silence was oppressive.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 And then, high above, like a heartbeat, there was a beat of wings.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:24.000
 He glanced up through the lattice of leaf and bark and saw a figure silhouetted against the clouds,

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:31.000
 human-like, a spear clutched in one hand, broad white feathered wings powering it through the air.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000
 The Ben-Elim.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000
 Mical.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 Mical.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:42.000
 Then, like an avalanche, he remembered.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000
 Mical, in the great hall of dressill, telling Corbin about the deception of the Ben-Elim,

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:54.000
 how the prophecy was nothing more than a strategy, a trick to force Azeroth's hand, to lure Caledus and the Catachem to dressill.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:02.000
 That the bright star and black sun were an invention, fabricated to snare Azeroth in the trap of his own making.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:09.000
 A sound strategy, maybe, in the great war between Ben-Elim and Catachem, the faithful and the fallen,

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 apart from the fact that it used people's lives like pawns on a throwboard.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.000
 My dar's life, my mams, so many others.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 Rage swept through him, vamed with betrayal at the memory of Mical's confession.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 He remembered resisting the urge to strike Mical, then leaving, knowing his rage was at the boundaries of his control,

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000
 and had ended up sitting upon a hill in the forest.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:43.000
 He had sat there a long time, contemplating Mical's words, trying to make some sense of what he would mean for the future.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
 And then the jot-on giants had come.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:52.000
 Ill dair, their warlord, Slayer of Tuckle, Gar's dar.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:01.000
 Images flicked through his mind, a bare, roaring, spittle spraying from its red moor, running, foliage whipping his face,

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:10.000
 the thunder of the bear's pursuit, the wounds to his knee and chest, a spear piercing storm, a river, ice cold water.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.000
 Storm howling as giants had dragged him away from her side.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000
 Storm.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.000
 Pang shuddered through Corbin's chest as if someone were gripping his heart, squeezing and twisting it.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000
 He couldn't breathe.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 His sorrow was a physical thing that crushed the air from his lungs, he staggered towards the lake, dropping to his knees at the water's edge.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:38.000
 Even as he did so, more memories flooded his mind than unstoppable wave of Drasil,

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.000
 the frantic blowing of horns and sound of battle that had drifted up to him.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:52.000
 Images of his loved ones swam before his eyes, Corbin, Gar, Cohen, Daff and Farrell, Brenner so many others.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
 Do they still live?

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000
 Who was attacking Drasil?

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000
 dimly he became aware of movement.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:07.000
 Before him, the water of the lake started to shift and foam, something rising from the depths.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:13.000
 The shape appeared, water cascading and masking for a moment, the creature within.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:21.000
 Then a man was striding from the lake with water dripping from the dark cloak that trailed him like seaweed.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000
 He approached Corbin.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000
 An interested, amicable smile upon his face.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000
 His skin was gray-mottled and vamed like a dead thing.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000
 His hair was black and slick as oil.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.000
 A black scabbarded sword hung at his hip.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 "Well," the man said.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.000
 "It's not often that I get visitors."

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000
 His voice was liquid, flowing like a shallow stream over shingle.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.000
 "What brings you to my home?"

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:56.000
 "I, I've been here before," Corbin said.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000
 "I know, I've watched you."

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000
 "This is the other world," Corbin said.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:14.000
 "It is, and this lake, this tree, this valley," the dark head man said with the wave of his hands, "our mine."

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.000
 He shrugged.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000
 "Water dripping from his hair."

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000
 "Are you?"

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000
 "Ben Ellum," Corbin asked.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000
 The man laughed.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000
 A damp exhalation.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:31.000
 "Those pompous fools, no, though to my shame we are related."

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000
 "Cardachim," Corbin asked fearful.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000
 "Hardly," the man snorted.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000
 "Those fawning debauch deviance.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000
 Do I look like one of them?"

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000
 "No," Corbin admitted.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.000
 "Well, then, I am just me."

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000
 "Virefon."

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.000
 He lifted his hands, held one up to the sky, displayed his fingers.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.000
 Corbin saw that they were webbed like a frog's feet.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:03.000
 "You are from the world of flesh, are you not?"

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 The man said.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
 Corbin nodded whereily.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.000
 "And what is your name?

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.000
 Creature of flesh."

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 Virefon asked him, leaning in uncomfortably close.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000
 His breath washing over Corbin moist and full of rot.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000
 Corbin did not want to tell him.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 "I'm going to go now," he said, standing.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000
 "I don't want him to be far away from his creature."

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000
 "I don't think so," Virefon sighed.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:39.000
 "I think we should continue this conversation somewhere a little more."

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000
 "Private."

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000
 Corbin backed away, turning to leave.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
 Something grabbed his ankle.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:53.000
 Looking down he saw that it was a tendril of Virefon's cloak, flexing like a grasping limb.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000
 It wrapped itself around his leg as Virefon walked back towards the lake then,

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 looking strength, the cloak pulled tight and started dragging Corbin.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000
 For a moment, Corbin was too shocked to resist, but then he scrambled back,

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 yanking at his ankle, hand grasping for his sword.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.000
 "Come on, don't Dali!"

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.000
 Virefon called over his shoulder as he reached the lake.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.000
 He walked in, sinking rapidly.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:24.000
 The cloak seemed to split, to flow, forming a myriad of strands,

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:29.000
 reaching up to Corbin, each one contracting around his ankles, wrists and throats.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:32.000
 Then he was being pulled down to the lake shore,

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.000
 trust like a fly in a spider's web, into the water.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000
 Panic filled him as his head sank beneath the surface,

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:44.000
 and he struggled desperately, straining Vain's bulging muscles, screaming.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000
 With a sinewed tearing effort, he pulled one arm free,

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.000
 and then he was bursting out of the water, hoisted into the air, dangling before the creature,

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:58.000
 held up by his dark cloak that looked now more like a squirming nest of snakes.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:04.000
 Corbin gasped for breath, ripping at the cloak strands and closing him to little effect.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.000
 Virefon regarded him with a cold fascination.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:14.000
 "Tell me your name," Virefon said, anger swelling in his voice the crash of waves upon rocks.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:19.000
 "Let me go!" Corbin grunted through his constricted chest.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.000
 "You have trespassed here," disturbed my rest.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.000
 Virefon said wetly as he pulled Corbin closer.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:36.000
 "In return, I will have some answers, and then, after I may see how you taste."

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:41.000
 A wave of found breath in golfed Corbin making his stomach lurch.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000
 "What are you?" Corbin coughed.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:48.000
 "I am Virefon," the creature said.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.000
 His mouth opening wide, seeming to grow before Corbin's eyes wider and wider,

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.000
 revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth glistening and dripping with mucus.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:03.000
 "Eater of souls!"

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:08.000
 There was a whistling sound, and a spear slammed into Virefon's cloak, piercing it.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:13.000
 Virefon screamed as Ben Elim swept down from the sky.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.000
 More spears flew stabbing into Virefon's body.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.000
 His yell deepened into a bellow of pain and rage,

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:26.000
 and Corbin found himself thrown to the ground as the creature turned its attention to its attackers.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:30.000
 Then hands were grasping Corbin, and he was hoisted into the air again.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:37.000
 There was a Ben Elim eye, the side of him surging, skywards, their wings beating hard.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.000
 Within heartbeats, the conflict in the lake was below them.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000
 Virefon and his living cloak sinking into the water,

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:49.000
 one strand coiling around a Ben Elim, dragging it beneath the surface.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:54.000
 The Ben Elim's scream cut short as the water closed over its head.

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.000
 They flew higher, following the course of a winding valley,

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
 twisting and turning amongst peaks and sheer cliffs,

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
 until Corbin's or a fortress appeared in the crags,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
 a series of towers and battlements.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000
 Carved from bone-white stone, it seemed to glow even under the dark clouds

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
 that pressed down from above.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
 The silhouettes of Ben Elim filled the air about its towers,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:25.000
 some spiraling amidst the clouds, others hovering sentinels with long spears and glistening mail.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000
 He saw that many more patrolled the long, winding walls,

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.000
 and the sounds of combat drifted up to him from the huge courtyard between the high towers.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
 They are sparring, as we were in Jassel.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
 They are preparing for war.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:46.000
 His rescue was alighted upon the flat roof of a tower and half-dranked Corbin through an archway,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.000
 down a flight of stairs, marching him into a huge high-sealing chamber.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:57.000
 Within it, thousands of Ben Elim stood, all gleaming mail and white feathers,

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:03.000
 a dense crown which parted before Corbin and his guards in an elegant ripple of feather and mail.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000
 Their pale, emotionless face is staring at him.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.000
 In front of him was a raised deus, wide steps leading up to it,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000
 and upon it, a great white throne, paler's bone,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:24.000
 a splayed back fashion to look like feathered wings that rose and curled about the figure slumped within it.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000
 Its white feathered wings were wrapped around the figure like a great cloak,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
 feather tips drooping the floor.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.000
 The figure's head was bowed, dark hair hanging, concealing its face.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.000
 As Corbin was march closer, the figure raised its head,

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000
 its hair parting to reveal a familiar face that stared back at him.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
 Micah

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000
 Emotions ignited within Corbin warring with one another,

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000
 relief at seeing the face of a comrade, a friend in this strange place,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000
 but alongside that the still raw wound of Micah's betrayal.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000
 Corbin felt his cheeks flush with anger, even as Micah sat straighter,

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
 his face wracked with grief and pain,

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:13.000
 an expression that was so out of place on the face of creatures normally marble carved in expressionless.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
 What is wrong with him?

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
 Micah drew in a shuddering breath.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000
 "Thank Elion," Micah said.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000
 "You still live in your weld of flesh.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.000
 If your spirit is here, then your body has survived."

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
 Micah seemed to struggle with his speech,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
 as if each word took an effort of pain and will.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:44.000
 Otherwise, your spirit would have crossed the bridge of swords."

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
 Corbin blinked.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000
 Micah reached out, beckoning Corbin to come closer.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000
 Corbin flinched away, "Don't touch me," Corbin snapped,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
 remembering the great horn and dressill.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
 "The great lie."

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
 Corbin heard it is of outrage rippled through the room behind him.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
 "Michael held a hand up.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
 Peace," Micah said.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000
 "But one of the Ben-Elim spluttered.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:18.000
 This creature of flesh he gives insult to you are high-capped in second only to the all-father.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:24.000
 He has a good cause," Micah said, luring his head.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
 He leaned back in his chair and gestured for Corbin to stand.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
 Corbin saw that Micah was paler than he'd ever seen him.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
 Around his neck was a red wound, raw and angry.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
 It was leaking some clear ico-like substance.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
 "What happened to you," Corbin said.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.000
 "Sometimes, if the wound is bad in the world of flesh,

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.000
 we bring a shadow of it with us back to the other world."

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
 Corbin's hand went to his chest.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:59.000
 The dull ache felt with every breath and understood that it was an echo of his broken ribs.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:05.000
 "So, what is that a shadow of?" Corbin said, pointing to Micah's wound.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000
 "I was beheaded in dressill," Micah said.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
 "What?"

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
 The hornblasts, the sounds of battle that I heard.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000
 A seed of dread unfurled deep in Corbin's gut.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000
 Caledas, nathair, they attacked.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
 "How?" the tunnels, Micah said, "wirly."

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
 "What are my friends and kin, my people?"

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000
 "Some escaped," Micah breathed.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:43.000
 "Gah, let every treat down the north, tunnel, I held the kadashim as long as I could."

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
 He shook his head.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
 "Dracil is taken."

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
 The fortress, fallen.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
 Taken by nathair and Caledas.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
 The implications hit Corbin like a stone fist.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
 My warband defeated.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000
 Those that followed me, trusted me, dead.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
 My friends.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
 See what your scheming has achieved.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
 He snarled and launched himself at Micah.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:18.000
 His attack was so unexpected and so fast that he had his fingers clamped about Micah's throat before anyone could move.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:25.000
 Then there was an explosion of activity behind him, shouting, hands, grasping him, wings, flexing, beating.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000
 Blows rained upon Corbin, but he shrugged them off, continued squeezing.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:37.000
 Micah did not fight back, just sat within the great wings of his throne and stared into Corbin's eyes as he cried tears of grief and rage.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
 "You have motored my friends!"

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
 He yelled.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000
 A red rage swallowing him, replacing his despair.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:50.000
 Something crunched into his head and the world disappeared for a moment in a white explosion.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
 He felt his fingers slipping from Micah.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:58.000
 I'll try to hold on, but then more hands were gripping him, dragging him back, pressing him onto his knees.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.000
 He looked up to see weapons raised over him and angry faces encircling him.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
 A spear was speeding towards his heart.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:12.000
 "No," Micah said, and the spear froze, a hand span from Corbin's chest.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000
 Angry voices called out, Corbin heard words like punishment and sacrilege.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:24.000
 "No," Micah repeated, and the crowd parted before Corbin to reveal Micah still sitting on the throne.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:32.000
 He regarded Corbin with his emotionless face back in place, though Corbin thought he saw cracks within it.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
 "He has caused to be angry with me."

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
 "Angry!"

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
 Corbin shook his head.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
 "You lied to me.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
 To all of us in trashill, used us as baits, as pawns!

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000
 All of you!" he added, glaring at the Ben L.M. gathered around him.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
 Most of them are glaring back at him.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000
 "And now, it seems that your plan has worked a little too well."

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:03.000
 "You certainly brought Caledas running to Drasill. Tell me, Micah, was it also part of your plan for Drasill to fall?

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:08.000
 For my friends, my kin, my people, to be slaughtered."

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
 He ground his teeth swallowed.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
 "Or for you to be beheaded."

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
 "No."

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:19.000
 "It was not," Micah said with a slow sigh.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
 The war is lost before it even began.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
 The banish lands conquered.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
 All those whom I love, slain or scattered.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.000
 Despair rose up in him then, draining all energy from his limbs.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000
 He slumped in his captors' grip.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
 "It is not over," Micah said.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:47.000
 It took a few moments for his words to seep through the fog of misery and hopelessness that engulfed Corbin.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
 "Of course it is," Corbin whispered.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:58.000
 "No, not while you live, not while Caledas still seeks the seven treasures."

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:08.000
 He needs them all to fulfill his plan and until then, Asroth is bound here in the other world.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:14.000
 "There is no way back from this. We don't know that," Micah said.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.000
 "Gah, led many from Jasil, they may still live.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.000
 There are those who would still stand against Nithair and Caledas.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
 There is still hope."

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.000
 Corbin's head snapped up, locking eyes with Micah.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
 "Do not speak to me of hope.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000
 You who have fed me lies all my life."

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.000
 "You are no better than Asroth in his car to shame a liar.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.000
 A deceiver, and I wish I'd never met you."

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
 Angry words rippled around the chamber.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000
 "My Cales gaze, hardened.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:01.000
 I have allowed you the courtesy of expressing your anger, but do not go too far."

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:08.000
 "There is more at stake here than your hurt feelings you are behaving like an angry child."

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:15.000
 He paused, visibly sagged in his chair, plus a hand over his eyes.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000
 "Your whole world lies in the balance.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:26.000
 It is not over yet there is still hope, a fighter's chance.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:32.000
 "There is no chance, nothing that I can do back in the banish lands.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:40.000
 I am a captive of the jolten wound in my bones, broken, and storm his dead."

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:46.000
 His voice choked in his throat, a fresh wave of emotions swelling in his chest.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
 Micah lowered his head.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000
 Another grievous blow, he muttered.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:59.000
 Storm was a better guardian than a score of sheildman.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
 She was more than my guardian.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
 Corbin snald.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
 She was my companion.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
 My friend.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.000
 He rubbed his eyes, angrily brushed away his tears.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
 "Your lies?

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:20.000
 Of course the death of my kin, my da, my mam, my friends, and so many others.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.000
 All of them dying for a hope that never existed.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
 All of them dying for me.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.000
 And because you underestimated Caledas, you have left us with no chance.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000
 While there is breath in your body, there is a chance."

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:42.000
 Micah shouted, leaning forwards in his chair, hands gripping the armrests.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
 For a moment, his cold face melted away.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:53.000
 And if there is no chance of victory, then what a vengeance?

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000
 Two more, then talk and whine.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000
 Seek your vengeance for those fallen.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:06.000
 Or would you rather, wallow in self-pity, then try to save your loved ones?"

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
 He sagged.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000
 The effort clearly draining him.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
 I will not be told what to do by him.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000
 I will be controlled and manipulated by him no longer.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
 Nevertheless, Micah's words affected him.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:26.000
 Images of Gar and Coen, Coraline, Farron and Daff, Brenner, Hidana.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.000
 So many others that he had met during a long, hard journey from his home in Dunkarag to Drassel.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000
 And the thought of them without him, perhaps fighting, maybe dying.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000
 For a moment, all he wanted was to get back to them.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
 To be at their side.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000
 I will not abandon them to death or torment, let them face the end alone.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
 I must go back if there is a chance to help them.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
 He looked up at Micah.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
 Felt his fists clenching.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.000
 "I will go back, but not for you.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
 Not for any of you.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
 I'm your puppet no longer.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
 I go to help those that I love."

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000
 Micah stared at him for long, silent moments.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
 Then nodded his head.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:21.000
 "I will help you all that I can, though I am bound to the other world now.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000
 I cannot return to the banished lands.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
 I don't want your help."

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
 Corbin growled.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
 Micah finally nodded.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
 "Good?" he whispered.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.000
 He approached Corbin and placed the palm of his eyes, whispering words that Corbin could not hear.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:49.000
 He opened his mouth to say something, but then the world seemed to fade about him.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
 Chapter 5.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.000
 Rafe.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000
 Rafe felt something wet and rough scratching across his cheek.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000
 He wanted to move, but found he lacked the ability.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
 Even opening his eyes was too much of an effort.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.000
 So he just lay there, allowing his other senses to wash over him.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
 He ached.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
 His muscles, joints, his very bones seem to throb.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.000
 But even as he became aware of the sensation, it began to fade, transforming into something else.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:28.000
 A sense of relaxed exhaustion, like lying in a hot bath after a long hunt.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:35.000
 He could hear birdsong, the ripple of river water and the holes of moored boats nudging into one another.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:41.000
 Beyond that, the drum of hooves, many feet, voices.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:48.000
 He did not know how long he lay on the ground like that, but at some point the rough wet scratching on his face came back.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000
 A dog's tongue licking him.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000
 A smile cracked his lips and he opened his eyes.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:01.000
 An explosion of light burst upon him, feeling as if rays of the sun had pierced his skull, lancing through his head.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.000
 He screwed his eyes shut, the pain dimmed.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
 He tried again slowly this time.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.000
 He saw a black nose, snuffling, fur tickling his chin.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000
 "That old sniffer?" he croaked.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
 His voice roar and cracked.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000
 Ignoring the pain he pulled himself to his knees, then to his feet.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000
 He staggered and braced himself against the wide trunk of a tree.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000
 "What has happened to me?"

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.000
 He stretched the stiffness in his body melting away.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:40.000
 For a while he stood there, feeling his muscles uncoiling, enjoying the sense of energy,

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000
 of strength and vitality that flowed through him.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:49.000
 "I feel good," he muttered, smiling and reaching to Pat's sniffer's head.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.000
 He saw scratches standing further away, eyeing him suspiciously.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.000
 "It's all right," he said, beckoning the hound.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
 "Nothing to fear?"

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000
 The hound came to him.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:08.000
 He is still flattened, tail tucked low, and he laughed, ruffling the hound's fur.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
 "I'm starving."

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
 Memories filtered back.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000
 Of the battle in the swamp against Idana's warband, his desperate escape,

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:23.000
 of walking away from Morkant's tower after his interrogation by Rin and her giant Uthas.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.000
 Then walking along the riverbank, finding a solitary spot beside a tree

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000
 to drink a skin of wine and eat some cold lamb.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:37.000
 He'd scratched at his chin, felt a thick layer of stubble, which felt strange.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
 "How long have I been here?"

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000
 He looked around, at the marshland trees and bushes.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000
 The birds nesting amongst them blue and orange butterflies flitting,

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000
 then up at the sky, which was a clear blue.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000
 The spring sun, warm upon his face.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000
 "Somehow everything felt sharper, brighter, and clearer."

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.000
 "I feel reborn."

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.000
 He looked down and noticed the shoulder of lamb he'd brought with him from the camp.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.000
 The hounds had stripped it clean and cracked the bones.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:14.000
 Beside it with a broken shards of the box he'd found in the bog near Dunterris.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:20.000
 And next to that was a cup, dark metal, runes carved into its rim.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
 A dribble of wine ran from it.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.000
 And he remembered, like a punch in the guts.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000
 A drank from it.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
 His legs felt weak and he leaned against the tree as he felt for a moment

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.000
 in echo of the pleasure and pain that erect his body after drinking from the cup.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
 He felt scared.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
 "What have I done?"

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
 It is an enchanted cup it has some kind of spell upon it.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
 But I'm not dead.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
 If anything I feel more alive than ever before."

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:57.000
 He took a tentative step away from the tree, reaching down to pick up the bag of the contained his kit.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000
 For a few heartbeats he stood and stared at the cup, then quickly bent and grabbed it,

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
 stuffing it into his bag.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
 He picked his way along a twisting trail amongst the tall grass banks of Reed,

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
 eventually coming across a stream that led him back to the river.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
 The river was full of moored boats, the strong smells of newly-cut pine,

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
 sap and fresh soaked pitch filled the air.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.000
 Frames of scaffolding timbers that held half-constructured boats lined the river bank,

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:30.000
 skeletal hulls like the bones of flesh-picked whales.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
 Teams of men were working on them.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
 Rafe walked past unnoticed,

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000
 moving out onto the rolling meadows that spread beyond the marshlands

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.000
 and ended in the north at the fringes of the Baglin forest.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000
 He stopped here, staring,

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000
 surprised at the difference in what felt like only a half day,

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000
 but it clearly been longer.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.000
 Immediately before him was more tense tower.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000
 Wains pulled by shaggy coated orock,

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.000
 filed in and out of the tower gates.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
 On the meadow about it,

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:09.000
 the tents of rins' warband of black and gold had multiplied.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.000
 To the west, Rafe saw horsemen riding at straw targets,

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000
 other men on foot sparring with practice swords and spears.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000
 They are radiating for another stab at a Danavan.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
 Rafe

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
 More can was striding towards him,

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
 looking striking in his black quirass,

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000
 unsabled cloak, etched in gold trim,

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
 hair pulled back,

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000
 warrior braid freshly bound with gold wire.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
 Two guards walked at his back.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000
 He looks far better than the last time I saw him,

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000
 in Rins' tent, fresh from the battle,

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.000
 covered in marsh slime and blood and stinking like a stagnant pool.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
 Where have you been, boy?

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
 More can't snap to him.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000
 I, uh, over there,

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.000
 sleeping.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
 Rafe said,

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
 pointing vaguely at the river and marshes,

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
 sleeping, more can't snorted.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
 For a ten night?

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
 A ten night.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
 Before you deserted,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000
 then for you I'd just stomach for any more battle.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000
 I have so.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
 Rafe said,

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
 braid laying at more can't's veiled insult.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
 What's your self?

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
 More can't scald.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
 I'm Lord of Arden now.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.000
 I could put your head on a spite with a snap of my fingers.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
 Rafe felt a blossoming of anger,

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000
 hotter and faster than he was used to.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000
 With an effort, he suppressed it.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
 I thought Ebenez was Lord of Arden.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:46.000
 Ebenez has not returned, is believed dead.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000
 More can't said, disdainfully.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.000
 Ryn has appointed me to rule in his absence.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
 Dead?

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.000
 In truth, Rafe had lost sight of Ebenez

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
 when the rebels fire had started sinking their boats

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000
 and Rafe had become too preoccupied with his own survival

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
 to worry about anyone else.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.000
 But he would grieve for Ebenez if he was dead.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.000
 He had been his Lord for as long as he could remember.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000
 His dar had served Ebenez as huntsman for many years.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000
 So.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
 More can't told him, Ardenly.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.000
 I am your Lord now and you shall remember it.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
 Now come with me.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
 Queen Ryn wishes to speak with you.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
 He followed more can't around the room of the hill,

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
 skirting the palisaded wall as they made their way through

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000
 lines of tents to a central larger one.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000
 Towering like statues, two giants stood outside

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000
 alongside a handful of Ryn's shieldmen.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
 Rafe gazed at them as he waited to be announced.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000
 The giant near as to him was a female.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
 She stood with folded arms, returning his stare

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.000
 to knife-hilt as long as short swords crisscrossing her back.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000
 Her brow furrowed as she regarded him.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000
 Queen Ryn will see you now.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
 A shieldman told them.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000
 And Rafe stepped out of the sunshine into the cool shadow of the tent.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
 Ryn was sat at a broad table.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000
 Her silver hair braided with golden wire.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000
 A bare skin cloak pulled high about her neck.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000
 A huge parchment was unrolled on the table.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.000
 Rafe glanced at it and saw it was a map of the marshlands.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000
 Their position at Morgan's tower marked upon it.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
 The marshes were largely a blank

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.000
 with a circle roughly marking the position of Duncan.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000
 Behind Ryn stood Uthas of the Bonothee,

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
 gripping a thick, shafted spear

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:48.000
 at about his neck hung a necklace made from long, curved fangs.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
 Ah, the wanderer returns.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
 Ryn cried when she saw him.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
 I thought you did.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
 Or captured.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
 She added.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
 Her eyes narrowing.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.000
 Can I trust you now?

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
 Where have you been?

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
 Sleeping.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
 More can't say it before Rafe could reply.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
 Who is?

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
 Ryn asked.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
 No one.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000
 Myself.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000
 Rafe started.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
 My dogs.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000
 Ryn raised an eyebrow.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
 No need to be shy.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:24.000
 Everyone needs some time to relax and indulge in their personal pleasures.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
 That's what he's like for.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000
 But sleeping for a ten-night, a little extreme, don't you think?

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
 And a little unbelievable.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
 Are you lying to me?

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
 No, my queen.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000
 Rafe mumbled.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000
 Or he drank something.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
 More can't snorted laughter.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:47.000
 Ryn paused instead at Rafe had cocked him to one side.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
 Are you well?

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000
 You seem different.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
 Rafe returned her gaze steadily.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000
 His eyes drawn to the details of her face.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:05.000
 The wrinkles creased around her mouth, tracing her tapestry upwards across the arch of her cheeks to cluster around her eyes.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000
 Her skin appeared so fine almost translucent.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
 His gaze was drawn deeper.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:18.000
 The pulse of myriad veins beneath her diaphanous skin as steady and hypnotic beat.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:24.000
 His gaze drifted higher to her eyes, which were a deep dark blue like still waters.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.000
 They transfixed him.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
 Darts are your queen.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000
 More can't snapped.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000
 Raising his hand to cuff Rafe across the back of her head.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:39.000
 Rafe saw it all as if in slow motion and before he'd even realised what he was doing,

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:45.000
 his hand shot up, grabbing more can't wrist and stopping it dead in its tracks.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
 There was a moment of shocked silence.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:53.000
 Everyone staring at Rafe as more can't tug on his arm, unable to break Rafe's grip.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
 "Ah, dare you!"

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000
 More can't snout.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000
 As he struggled to free himself before reaching for the knife at his belt.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000
 "I'll carve off your bloody fingers one by one."

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000
 "Enough!" Ryn said.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
 More can't froze.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:14.000
 And with a conscious effort, Rafe suppressed a bubbling anger within him and released more can't wrist.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.000
 Red marks were already purply into bruises.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.000
 "I don't like being struck," Rafe muttered.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:28.000
 "So we can see," Ryn said with a calculating smile.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:35.000
 More can't scowl at him as with us leaned forwards, grey bushy eyebrows bunching together in a frown.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.000
 More can't his lord of art and then.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
 "What have I done?"

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:47.000
 "I am sorry," he said quietly.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000
 Then rubbed his eyes.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000
 "I do not know why I did that or what's happening to me."

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:58.000
 Ryn exchanged a quick unfathomable look with Uthas before turning back.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:03.000
 "I have need of you so I shall forgive you," this once.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000
 "Thank you, my lady."

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:12.000
 Rafe had the sense to dip his head as he spoke, avoiding the urge to glance at more canton's smirk.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000
 "And I am sorry," my queen.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000
 He added for good measure.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
 Ryn waved a hand.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
 "Sorry, there's not good enough," she said.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.000
 A tone entering her voice that scared Rafe, "I am your queen."

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.000
 "And you are my subject."

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
 "Learn your place."

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000
 "I will," Rafe muttered.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000
 "See that you do," Ryn said.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:48.000
 "And also make sure that the next time I send for you you come, your life is mine."

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.000
 She stared at him, no hint of expression on her face.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:58.000
 "Now I can make it a good life or an unpleasantly short one."

01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.000
 Rafe gulped.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000
 "Do we understand one another?"

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000
 "I," my queen.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000
 Rafe nodded.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.000
 "Good."

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.000
 "Now come over here and help me with this map.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:19.000
 I aim to have a diner's head on a platter within a ten-night."

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
 Chapter 6

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000
 Kamlin

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000
 Kamlin patted along the stream's edge.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000
 His bow held loosely in one hand.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.000
 He was returning to Dunn-Krin from a hunting trip.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
 Hunting men.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
 It had been a ten-night since the battle of Dunn-Krin,

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.000
 where Evanis and Morgan's war band had been largely scattered.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000
 He and a score of others had set about hunting down the stragglers.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.000
 The more we kill now, the fewer we'll come back to try and kill us later.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000
 Kamlin had split his hunting party into pairs,

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000
 although he himself had ended up in a group of three.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:03.000
 He glanced down at Meg, the band who he had rescued from a village on the outskirts of the marshlands.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.000
 Though she's more than paid me back, the time she saved my hide now.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
 She was walking alongside him,

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000
 wearing a warrior's leather jerkin, holding a spear in one hand,

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000
 her other resting upon the pommel of a new dagger that was hanging at her belt,

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000
 all of them spoils taken from the battle of Dunn-Krin.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.000
 Kamlin had helped her cut down and re-stitch the jerkin,

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.000
 as well as chopping an arm's length of the spear to make it more manageable for her.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.000
 Part of him had been concerned about her accompanying him.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
 She seemed worse, though.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000
 A memory of the mottled feet of a band swinging from gallows,

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:46.000
 insinuated its way into his mind, beneath it bloated corpses littering a courtyard.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
 Much worse.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
 A shadow crossed his path,

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000
 and he looked up to see the third member of his party flying above him.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.000
 Craft swooped down and squorked loudly.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
 Dark waters?

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
 Tall towers?

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
 I know.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
 Kamlin muttered.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
 So I'll need a bird to tell me when I'm close to home.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000
 Nevertheless, he raised a hand at Craft.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
 When I first met that bird,

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
 I must confess I didn't like him much.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.000
 Turns out he's right-handy to have a bow, though.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.000
 Craft had led him straight to over a dozen enemy warriors lost in the marshes.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000
 Kamlin had made sure they stayed lost,

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000
 left them lying face down in the mud.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
 He walked through a last bank of reeds

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
 and came out on the shore of a huge lake.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:41.000
 The towers and walls of Duncan reared out of the lake's waters,

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:46.000
 damp and moss-covered like some frozen Leviathan.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.000
 Figures moved on the battleman walls, boats scuddling between towers.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.000
 All about him on the lake sure there was motion.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:59.000
 The wives and bands of the warriors who had fought in the battle of Duncan had finally returned

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
 from their hiding place deeper in the marshes,

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
 and all manner of rough shelters were being erected,

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:10.000
 mostly consisting of linen tents and panelled walls of woven willow.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.000
 Best not make themselves too comfortable.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000
 Meg dashed off and merged into the crowds.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.000
 Kamlin watched as a pair of children rummaged amongst the piles of war gear

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.000
 that have been stripped from the dead and heaped in mounds along the lake sure.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:32.000
 Great stacks of swords and spears, shields, boots, belts, knives, quivers,

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:38.000
 shirts of mail, courasses of boiled leather and cloaks of black and gold.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.000
 Meg reappeared at his side.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.000
 Now with an iron helmet much too big for her head added to her outfit.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000
 Kamlin tried not to laugh but wasn't wholly successful.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000
 What?

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
 Meg scalded him.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000
 "Think that helmet might slow you down?" he said.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000
 "Besides, your head's thick enough.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
 Doubt if you'll need it."

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
 She punched him in the leg.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
 "When are we leaving?" she asked.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.000
 "Don't know." he shrugged.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.000
 Probably talk about it a while before we get around to doing this.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.000
 He paused as the crowds opened up before him.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000
 Yidana was walking calmly through their midst, stopping down again to address

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.000
 someone directly, holding a hand here, cupping a cheek there,

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000
 always seeming to be interested in what was being said to her.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:34.000
 Baird, the one-eyed warrior of Darwin, and Von, accompanied her.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:39.000
 Kamlin frowned as he watched the young warrior, his eye shadowed with dark circles, grief,

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000
 carving new lines upon his face.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
 "No, I'd guess I'm partly to blame for that."

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000
 Me having killed his dar might have something to do with his current mood.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:55.000
 He tracked Von after the battle, found him leagues from anywhere, alone apart from his dar.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
 Everness.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.000
 Kamlin had watched as they'd argued.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000
 He'd had ended with Von turning his back on Everness and walking away.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:10.000
 Everness had followed, hand dipping inside his cloaking, coming out with a knife for his fist.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000
 Kamlin had put two arrows through the man's chest.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.000
 His eyes flicked back to Adana.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:23.000
 She has grown since that night in Dunkari, when she saw her dar murdered.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:28.000
 Even fought Roshin of Darwin in the court of swords and one.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000
 Mind, exile was too good for a woman like that.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
 She'll never stop her trouble-making.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:40.000
 He searched behind Adana, looking for his friend, Halion.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
 He should be back by now.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:48.000
 Then he saw him sitting beside a fire with Lorcan, Halion's half-brother, Roshin's son,

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:53.000
 heir to the throne of Darwin, and unofficially betrothed at Adana, with his shieldman,

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.000
 broken no-neck as Meg affectionately referred to him.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
 "Good to see you," Halion said.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.000
 Rising and gripping Kamlin's forearm.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:07.000
 "You too," Kamlin said with a grin.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:13.000
 Kamlin looked at their faces, saw they were all somber, attention in the air.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
 Lorcan's dark eyes were red, looked as if he'd been weeping.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
 "Am I into Robson?" Kamlin asked.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.000
 "Just tell me to bugger off if I am."

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:28.000
 "No, Kamlin," Lorcan said, standing and surreptitiously wiping his eyes.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000
 Like it was just going.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:36.000
 He bathe him farewell, Halion squeezing his shoulder and left.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000
 Brogan followed faithfully in his wake.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000
 "He are eight," Kamlin asked.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000
 "No," Halion said honestly.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.000
 "But I think he will be."

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000
 I know Connell hates him just for being Russian son, but I like him.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
 There's no malice in him.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.000
 "Well, that's a rare thing," Kamlin observed.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:01.000
 And he did the right thing with Russian.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.000
 Choosing Adana over his mum wasn't easy.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
 "True," Kamlin said.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.000
 "Some times that I think could be a grim thing too."

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:15.000
 "I, and it's weighing heavy on him, and you, by the look of it."

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:19.000
 Halion looked tired, a strained look about his eyes.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
 Chopped on, then.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
 Kamlin asked Halion.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
 "Hi," Halion breathed.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
 Got back yesterday.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
 Did it go?"

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.000
 He was going to say well, but that didn't seem like the right word.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000
 Halion looked away, staring out into the marshland.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.000
 "Rushing didn't try to escape, if that's what you mean."

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.000
 "That's something," Kamlin said.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
 "I," Halion shrugged.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000
 "Not the easiest thing I've done," he added.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
 As Kamlin continued to stare at him.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
 "Thought you hated Russian."

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.000
 "I do."

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:57.000
 She murdered my mum, wanted to kill me, and Connell was the reason we fled down.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
 And she would have murdered Adana too.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.000
 Exile is better than she deserves.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000
 "But," Halion shrugged.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000
 His sea gray eyes hinting at the emotion he kept buried within.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
 Walking away was hard.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:14.000
 Execution is hard, you mean.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000
 We called it exile, but leaving her in the middle of the marsh.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
 It was a death sentence.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.000
 Kamlin patted, Halion shoulder.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
 Good hunting?"

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
 Halion asked him.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000
 "I."

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.000
 There are few less warriors in black and gold to tell the way to this place.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.000
 "Am I the fair's back?"

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.000
 "No, you're the last," Halion said.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
 "But we'll be waiting on you."

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000
 Adana refused to hold the council until you were back safe and sound.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:47.000
 Kamlin felt himself blush at that, a smile, twitching his lips.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:51.000
 It felt strange to be valued.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000
 Kamlin looked around the circle of familiar faces.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.000
 They were gathered in a clearing, amidst the ruins of what looked

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.000
 to have once been done Cron's gatehouse.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:07.000
 A collapsed tower arose above them, birds nests poking from its crumbled ramparts.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.000
 The old wall lay in ruins, granite boulders scattered in the grass.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:19.000
 Beneath their feet, ancient flagstones lay twisted and shattered by the encroaching roots of willow and older.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:25.000
 A crumbling archway framed Adana, who sat upon a moss-covered boulder.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:33.000
 She looked at home in a coat of mail and boiled leather circles, a great cloak about her shoulders and a sword at her hip.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.000
 Surrounding her were though she trusted most closely.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.000
 Pindathrin, her barrel-chested uncle.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:46.000
 And trust, the red-haired warrior from Navon once shielded to Owen, Navon's fallen king.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:52.000
 Lornkin, the young king in exile of Darwin, gaze solemnly at Adana.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:57.000
 The others that filled the area were mostly warriors, shieldmen to those present.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.000
 Halion, von, and one-eyed bed, watching Adana.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:06.000
 Close to them, broken, loomed, protectively close to Lornkin.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.000
 Craft perched upon the broken archway above Adana like a carved statue.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:15.000
 And I've no doubt that Meg is eavesdropping somewhere close by.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:21.000
 Adana stood, and the quiet conversations that had whispered amongst the ruined walls hushed.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:26.000
 "We are leaving down Kryn," she said, without any preamble.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.000
 Above her, Craft ruffled his feathers.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.000
 Leaving, he caught quietly.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.000
 "Our warriors' kin have only just returned," trust objected.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
 Not even dried their feet.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000
 And this is a good defensible spot.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
 There were rumbles of ascent.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.000
 After our victory they don't want to leave, I've seen it before.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.000
 The victory makes them feel secure.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000
 But our enemies know full, rins as canny as they come.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
 We'll not defeat her here again.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000
 And he had said as much to Adana.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
 "I agree," Adana said.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
 "We won the last skirmish."

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:07.000
 Ryn and her battle chiefs underestimated us, and did not scout well enough.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:12.000
 But they will not repeat that mistake, and they will be back.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:20.000
 We faced over 500 swords, put more than 300 in their cans, but however many we slew some escaped.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.000
 They know where we are, and they will report back to Ryn.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:29.000
 Next time they will be cautious, and Ryn rules four realms now.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000
 She has the numbers to keep throwing warriors at us until we are overwhelmed.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000
 And after in nodded Dowley in agreement.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000
 But where else is there?

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:44.000
 There are one or two other spots in these marshes, just said.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000
 Not as good as here, but still.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:51.000
 We need to change our tactics.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.000
 Only the families are staying in the marshes, you're done or interrupted.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.000
 Now I'm leading the warband out into Arden.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:02.000
 Arden, Kraftmotted above Adana.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:06.000
 He didn't look pleased, the feathers of his neck suddenly bristling.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.000
 What?

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
 Pindaphragm blurted.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000
 Now that is.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:16.000
 He paused face turning redder as he made an obvious effort to master his tongue.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
 But why?

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:22.000
 We cannot win the war, hiding in these marshes.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:30.000
 If Ryn is to be defeated, and Arden, Narvan and Dowan set free, then we must take the battle to her.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.000
 We must become an enemy she fears.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:38.000
 Winning one battle does not decide the war, dress said.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.000
 You've done well, but we could lead Ryn a merry dance around these marshes.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
 I know full well that the war is not one.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000
 Adana said, her voice abruptly cold.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
 Do not patronise me.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.000
 I am not a ban, and I am no stranger to loss and hardship.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
 She looks around at them all.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
 Each night I close my eyes.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.000
 Each day I awake I see the same thing.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:09.000
 My dead kin, my friends cut down my home, burning my people.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000
 Who cares for them while we are here?

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.000
 Never forget what Ryn has taken from us.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000
 It is time we took something back.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.000
 Time we took the battle to her.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
 Just snorted.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000
 We cannot face Ryn in open battle.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
 Pindaphragm growled.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
 Of course not, Adana said.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:37.000
 We are to few in numbers, less than 200 swords, but we can use that to our advantage.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:42.000
 We can move quickly, strike fast, disappear, strike elsewhere.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.000
 Show Ryn and the people of Arden that we have teeth.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:50.000
 Pindaphragm nodded, obviously considering it.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.000
 "That lonely last so long," he said.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.000
 Indeed, Adana said.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000
 Which is why the word needs the spread that Ryn has lost a great battle that her

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
 regent evidence is dead.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.000
 Her eyes flitted to Von and she took a deep breath.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.000
 "That the rightful queen of Arden has returned.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
 The people need to know.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
 They have not been forgotten.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000
 I know them.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.000
 They will join us if we offer them hope."

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
 Pindaphragm glanced at Rost.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000
 They shared alongside us than Rost nodded grimly.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:31.000
 "When did the girly I used to bounce upon my knee become this daring battle chief I see before me?"

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
 Pindaphragm said.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
 Adana just smiled.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:43.000
 Though her eyes flicked in acknowledgement to Kamlin and Halion, who had had long conversations with her, discussing the options.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.000
 Though to be fair, much of this plan came from her.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:53.000
 There was a flapping of wings and craft glided down to a light on the rock beside Adana.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.000
 "Drassil?" he croaked.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.000
 "I am afraid we are not going to dress ill."

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
 Adana said solemnly to the crow.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.000
 "Rung.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000
 Rung.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.000
 Rung."

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000
 Kraft called.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
 Flapping his wings vehemently muttering.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000
 "God wall.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000
 Seven treasures.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000
 Brina.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000
 Corbin."

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
 Over and over.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
 "We are needed here, Kraft."

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:21.000
 Adana said, reaching out to hand tentatively to touch the crow's ruffled feathers.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:27.000
 He looked at her then with a disgusted squawk flapped into the air and soared away.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:32.000
 Adana watched him for a few moments a dark smudge that faded quickly.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.000
 Kamlin followed Adana from the clearing.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
 The sun was dipping behind the trees.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:42.000
 A smell of cooking from a lake shore wafting over made Kamlin's belly grumble.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:49.000
 "What are you planning on doing with the plunder on the lake shore?" he asked Adana, as he drew up alongside her.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:55.000
 "Taking what we need, dumping the rest in the lake so that Rin can't use it," Adana replied.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:59.000
 "Make sure you keep the cloaks of black and gold," Kamlin said.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
 "Think they might come in handy."

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:07.000
 "I had thought exactly the same thing," Adana said with a vicious smile.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000
 "My lady," Adana said behind them.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.000
 "It was Von, his expression pensive.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.000
 They halted to let him catch up."

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:21.000
 "Crap," the things he said.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.000
 "I miss our friends as much as he does."

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.000
 Adana sighed impatiently, interrupting.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.000
 "Corbin, Brenner, Daff, Gar, the others."

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
 She felt silent.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.000
 Eyes distant.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:42.000
 "But much as I long to see them all again, I cannot dash off on a fool's errand to dress ill."

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:46.000
 The journey alone would take half a year, and I have a duty to my people

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:50.000
 "You miss understand me," Von said.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:57.000
 "It is the other things," he said about the God-war, the Batrassal and he took a deep breath.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:02.000
 "I need to talk to you about what my father told me before he died."

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.000
 "About what?" he Danner said.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:10.000
 "About seven treasures," Von said quietly.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.000
 "I think I know where one of them is."

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:19.000
 Chapter 7

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
 Coraline

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:27.000
 Coraline crouched beside Brenner, and watched the healer run her hands over Storm's torso.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:32.000
 The Wolfen had closed her eyes again, her breathing so shallow that she appeared dead,

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:37.000
 but as Brenner's fingers probed Storm's ribs, there was a faint growl and the flash of teeth.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000
 A storm called a lip.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
 "That hurts, then?"

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
 Brenner murmured.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:47.000
 "Sorry, madarlin," she soothed.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:52.000
 Fingers lifting a lip to look at the color of Storm's dums, opening an eyelid,

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.000
 lifting legs and bending them at the joints.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
 "It must be bad."

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:02.000
 Brenner never calls anyone "my darling," even if they've lost body parts.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.000
 Coraline looked up, hearing voices from beyond the ridge.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:09.000
 "Gah," organizing a search of the area.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:15.000
 While desperate to go and help continue the search for Corbin, worried that the others might miss something,

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.000
 she still couldn't bear to leave Storm's side.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
 "Can you help her?"

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
 Coraline whispered.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
 Brenner ignored her.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:29.000
 Eventually she paused, sat straight, her head bowed in thought.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:37.000
 She blew out a long breath and nodded, then with a quick movement she pulled out the file Coraline had seen her scrape giants blood into.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:45.000
 She scooped out some of the congealing blood and muttered as she lifted Storm's lip and ran her finger across Storm's lulling tongue.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:51.000
 "Fueil, novet, turt, schlant, ergus niet."

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:58.000
 She repeated the phrase again and again, gently massaging Storm's throat to help her swallow.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:06.000
 The air seems to grow chill about them and Coraline shivered, feeling as if a spider had just crawled the length of her spine.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:12.000
 Eventually, Storm shuddered, a spasm that rippled through her whole body.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:19.000
 Coraline was not sure if it was wishful thinking, but the woven breathing seemed to become stronger, steadier.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000
 Brenner stopped and looked at Coraline.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
 "What have you done?"

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.000
 Coraline whispered.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000
 "Not a word to anyone," Brenner hissed fiercely.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
 Eyes locking onto Coraline's.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:37.000
 "Without it, she is dead, she is too far gone, even now I cannot say."

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:43.000
 Guard dropped down beside them, his usually emotional as face twisted with concern.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:48.000
 "Well," he said, looking between Brenner and the Wolfen.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:53.000
 Brenner held Coraline's eyes still, waiting.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:58.000
 Coraline gave an imperceptible nod and then Brenner sighed and shook her head.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
 "I don't know."

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:06.000
 "She is battered," ribs broken, one lung punctured and collapsed.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:11.000
 "There is a hole through her shoulder and into her chest the size of my fist.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:17.000
 If none of these things ends are still the loss of blood might," she shrugged.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
 "Her spirit's strong."

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:22.000
 "None stronger," Gar said.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:26.000
 "I, that may give her a chance," Brenner said.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
 "Can she be moved?"

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.000
 Gar asked.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
 "No."

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.000
 Elle said a guard.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.000
 "Coraline, I need your eyes in the search for Corbin."

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
 Coraline nodded.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.000
 She brushed her fingertips across Storm's muzzle, shared a lingering look with Brenner,

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.000
 and then she was hauling herself up the ridge.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.000
 Coraline stood staring at the corpse of the great bear for a moment speechless.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:57.000
 It was huge, swiced the height of a horse in three times as wide.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000
 The bear was a patchwork of wounds.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:05.000
 A great flap of flesh hung loose above its shoulder more a tear than a cut.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:10.000
 Half the length of its side had been opened with what looked like a sword cut.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:15.000
 Ribs shattered and flakes of white bones sprinkled amongst the red ruin.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:21.000
 "Coraline," Coraline said, as she pointed to the sword wound in the bear's side.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:26.000
 "That's not what killed it," Farrell said, pointing away from the gaping slash in the bear's

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.000
 side.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
 "That is."

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
 The bear's throat had been opened.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
 The flesh lacerated and hanging.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:38.000
 They'd all seen that type of wound before.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
 "Storm," Gar said.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:45.000
 "This is where we found them," Pac said.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
 His voice roar with grief.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.000
 "Where does speed the giants?"

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:53.000
 "Describe this giant," Gar said.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:58.000
 "For head, the colour of fresh straw, a warhammer," he looked.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:01.000
 "Reecal," in charge.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
 And he was talking to Corbin.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
 "Could it be?"

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
 Ildere, late said.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:12.000
 Coraline felt a pulse of anger at the name saw Gar stiffen.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:15.000
 Ildere was the warlord of the jutten.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
 He had slain Tuckle.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.000
 Gar's father at Graham's hold and broken Gar's ribs when he had tried to avenge his

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
 dars death.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:28.000
 The ground showed the signs of more bears, at least another four, maybe more, as well as

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000
 other giants on foot.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:35.000
 Tracks led northwards into the forest away from Drazil.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:41.000
 Ildere and the jutten had fought alongside JL of Isletir, who in turn was allied to

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:47.000
 Nefair, so the logical conclusion was that the jutten would have taken Corbin to Drazil,

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
 who would have joined the battle.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.000
 But their tracks headed north.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
 "Where are they going?"

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
 Coraline asked.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.000
 Dath moved first, breaking the spell the dead bear had put upon them.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:06.000
 "Don't know, but we won't find them or a ban by standing here," he said.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
 "When did this happen?"

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.000
 Gar asked.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:13.000
 "Yesterday, after high sun," Pax replied.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000
 "We've seen no sign of a camp," Coraline said.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:21.000
 "You cook fires," Noah slept upon, little spore.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:26.000
 "My guess," is that he set off after capturing Corbin, so there must have been enough

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
 light to make a good start.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:33.000
 "If we follow their trail, see how much ground they covered before making camp, we'll get

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.000
 a better idea of how far ahead of us they are."

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:42.000
 Gar granted an agreement, and together they moved up a steep slope, entering an area

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
 of dense vegetation.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:51.000
 The hill levelled out and opened up, sunshine breaking through the canopy above.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:56.000
 It was past high sun, the day beginning its slow crawl towards night.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:02.000
 To the south, Coraline could see Drazil, pillars of smoke spiraling from it.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:06.000
 She looked back to the hills she was standing on, at the bear and giant tracks that led down

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.000
 the hill north away from Drazil.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:14.000
 The sound of movement drew Coraline's attention, a rustling.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:19.000
 Immediately her sword was in her fist and she was seeking cover the others following suit,

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.000
 Daph, with an arrow knocked.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.000
 Laith pulled one of her throwing knives as big as a sword from the leather belt strapped

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
 across her chest.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:34.000
 Gar signaled to the Gehar before and behind them, and then they waited.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:39.000
 Beyond the peak of the hill, the forest was shrouded in shadow, hindering Coraline's vision,

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:45.000
 but the crunch of forest litter and approaching Russell amongst the foliage spoke of many feet.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:52.000
 The figure appeared, crouched, moving carefully, dark shadows taking form behind it.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
 Iron glinted.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:51:00.000
 Then Gar was stepping from behind a tree, sheathing his sword and striding down the hill.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.000
 "Well, Matt," he said to her here.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:07.000
 The shieldman of Halen, boy king of Isilthir.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:13.000
 The warrior gave a lopsided grin of relief and took Gar's forearm in the warrior grip.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:19.000
 He was not overly tall but was broad and thick muscled his arms looking too long for his body.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:27.000
 Dark hollows wringed his eyes, and there was a long tear across the shoulder of his chain-mail shirt, blood caked around it.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:31.000
 "Be looking for you," Tahir said.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:34.000
 "And you found us," Gar said.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:37.000
 "How do you know what's a search?"

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:42.000
 "One of my lads saw my cow defending the door to the northern tunnel.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.000
 You don't defend the door for nothing."

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:51.000
 We retreated out of the main gate, made it to the forest and started circling this way.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:56.000
 More men appeared behind him, forty-fifty, others hidden in the forest gloom,

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.000
 most wearing the red cloaks of Isilthir.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:05.000
 Taken us all night and half the day, Forest was crawling with kadoshim and Vinthalan.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:09.000
 Think we've taught them to fear the forest better though.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:13.000
 A rumble of agreement spread through the warriors behind him.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:17.000
 "Where's Halen?" Gar asked, and to hear his face dropped.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.000
 "I don't know. I tried to find him."

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:24.000
 To hear his mouth twisted with something between pain and shame.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000
 "He's a resourceful lad," Gar said.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:30.000
 "I'd wager he's found a hole to hide in."

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.000
 "I hope so."

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
 To hear replied a tremor in his voice.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
 "How many were you?"

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.000
 Gar asked him.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:39.000
 Hundred and forty-six swords that can fight.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000
 To hear said, another dozen wounded.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:46.000
 "If done well, saving so many," Gar said.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:52.000
 "I, well, slow and steady wins the race as my old man used to say."

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
 To hear looked around.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.000
 "Where's Corbin?"

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:01.000
 "Taken by the jot on. We have just found his trail."

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
 To hear scald and spat.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
 "Chayance," he muttered.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
 Then looked back to Gar.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000
 "So, what do we do now?"

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.000
 Gar looked at him and blinked.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:18.000
 With Corbin and Mike Algon, Gar is our natural leader now.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:21.000
 And not just for us, but for all who fought it dressill.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:25.000
 He is Lord of the Gia and Corbin's first sword.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:29.000
 All Corbin wanted to do was find Corbin,

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
 but with survivors scattered throughout the forest,

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
 Gar had more to consider.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.000
 "I am going after Corbin," Gar said,

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:40.000
 and turned away to stare at the trail that led northwards.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
 To hear gripped his arm.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
 "What about us?"

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:45.000
 He asked.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:48.000
 "You and your warriors will rest a while.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000
 Think, eat, tent your wounds!"

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.000
 "I don't just mean us," to hear said,

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
 waving a hand at his men.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.000
 "I mean, the war band of dresser.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:03.000
 Many still live, can you not hear them still fighting?

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:07.000
 For Corbin, you cannot just abandon them."

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:11.000
 Gar stared at him, face twitching.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:14.000
 Corbin crouched beside the burned-out fire

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:17.000
 and brushed the ash with her fingers.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
 It was cold.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:22.000
 Not even the memory of heat lingering within it.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
 She glanced up.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.000
 Saw a daff at the edge of shadow poking at a mound of bear-dung.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
 It was sunset.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:33.000
 The forest was slipping into layers of shadow.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
 After talking with Tahir,

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:40.000
 Gar had sent out scouts to see if the survivors of dresser could be brought together.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:45.000
 Corbin had left with a daffon collar to find the giant's camp.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000
 She sprang up and ran from the site,

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:51.000
 easily following the path the giants had left.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
 They are overly confident

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:56.000
 in making no effort to hide their passage.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
 They would not think that we were hunting them.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
 If any I could reach them,

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.000
 it may be possible to steal Corbin back in the darkness.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
 It's too dark.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
 We'll lose their trail.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
 Daff called after her, but she ignored him.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
 Just ran on into the forest,

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:14.000
 following the tracks up a steep incline.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:17.000
 She climbed it and stopped.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
 Kicking at a moss-covered stone,

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:23.000
 her heart sinking as she realised the implications of what she could see.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
 The old giants rode.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.000
 She said to Daffon collar as they joined her.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
 It had been rebuilt by Jale's wall band.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
 And they're moving fast.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
 I...cola said.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
 Wherever they're going,

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.000
 they want to get there quickly,

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
 and are not worried about any pursuit.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:43.000
 Probably think we're all a bit busy with the fair and dry.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:46.000
 If he looked at Corlin.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
 How far ahead do you think they are?

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.000
 A day.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000
 Corlin grunted.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
 If they stick to that ruined road,

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.000
 maybe ten, twelve leagues.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
 When I catch them this night,

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:00.000
 then Corlin sucked in an old breath.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
 No, she growled.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
 What do you want to do?

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
 Daffon asked her.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.000
 I want to keep running.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
 Keep moving until we find them.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.000
 Find him.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.000
 But there would be no quick rescue now.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
 They would be fortunate to catch them in the half-a-ten night.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.000
 Probably longer if their bears have an open run.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:22.000
 Back to Gar, she said.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
 They had made it back to camping good time.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
 Considering they were travelling almost blind,

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:31.000
 the moonlight little more than a shimmer above the forest canopy.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
 Warriors were everywhere.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.000
 Clusted around small fires that had been surrounded by wicker panels,

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.000
 the height of their glow.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.000
 Corlin saw Gar standing beside a larger fire with a group around him.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:48.000
 To hear was there as well as others whom she was pleased to see.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:53.000
 Wolf in his bear pelts, her notched axe resting across his shoulder.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:56.000
 Javed, the pit fighter, small and wiry,

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.000
 a giant outline behind them.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:03.000
 Gar saw her enter the glade and the eyes met.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
 Corlin nodded.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:08.000
 Signaling that she'd found the giant's camp.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:13.000
 "Wish her strike, attack Darasil now," Javed said.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
 "They'd not be expecting that.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
 They've enthalen her in there."

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000
 There was a barely contained rage edging his voice.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
 "Likeus is there.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
 The man who gave me this."

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:28.000
 He twisted to show the scar burned into the back of his shoulder,

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
 a twisting spiral.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:37.000
 "He and his kind did this and worse to many of us," Javed said.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
 "Waving her hand at his warriors.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.000
 Angry murmurs spread amongst them.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:47.000
 "Kiekostone in anger, you'll hurt your foot," Taya said.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
 Javed just stared at him.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:53.000
 The giant behind them laughed at low rumbling like drums.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:58.000
 "Just something my old man used to say," Taya muttered.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:02.000
 "And what the hell does it mean?" Javed scowled.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:06.000
 "That acting from anger will get you killed," Gar said.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.000
 "Anga is the enemy."

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
 He turned to the group close to him.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:14.000
 "Fakken of the Banofi," Gar continued.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:17.000
 "What would your clan advise?"

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:20.000
 The giant stepped forwards into the fire light,

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:24.000
 a double-bladed axe silhouetted across his shoulder.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:30.000
 "Bala, one eye is wounded on the edge of life and death.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
 "Ethlin will not leave him.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.000
 We will not fight without her."

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
 Gar nodded thoughtfully.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:40.000
 "How many of your kin are with you?"

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
 "Burscore."

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:46.000
 "Babs more are scattered in fawn," the giant shrugged.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:50.000
 "I will send Brina with you when you return to them."

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:51.000
 "Good."

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:55.000
 "Ethlin, bad me, ask for her."

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:58.000
 "We cannot just do nothing," Javed snapped.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:02.000
 "I do not intend to do nothing," Gar said.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:09.000
 Other voices joined in, each proposing a different way forward attacks, ambushes, strategies.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
 This could go on all night.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:17.000
 Coraline slipped across the glade, moving beyond the small council to the side of the glade.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:23.000
 A makeshift rope ladder hung over the edge, another fire flickering below by the river's bank.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:27.000
 Coraline climbed nimbly down to find Brina with storm.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:32.000
 The pharaoh was there, too, sitting with his back to the slope, eyes closed,

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:35.000
 a big hand resting upon storm's shoulder.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
 "How is she?"

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.000
 Coraline asked.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:43.000
 Brina looked at her with sad eyes, tears glittering in the fire light.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:49.000
 "I fear she will not win this fight," the healer said.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
 Coraline's heart lurched in her chest.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.000
 "But she used magic," said a spell.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
 "But what you did?"

01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:03.000
 "It has helped," Brina said, giving her strength, but her wounds."

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:07.000
 She looked at pharaoh, then lowered her voice to little more than a whisper.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:16.000
 "And I used giant's blood, another wolf and or something closer to her own species would have more power."

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:20.000
 "There is a dead bear, half a league from here?"

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.000
 Coraline said.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:24.000
 "One of those that jot and giants ride."

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.000
 Brina reached into her cloak and removed an empty file.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:36.000
 "Feel this with its blood," she said, taking Coraline's hand and closing her fingers about it.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:42.000
 "She glanced at storm, at the wolf and shallow breathing, and be quick about it."

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
 Coraline was.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:49.000
 Most of the camp was sleeping when she returned from her gristy task.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:53.000
 Gar and the other leaders were still in deep conversation.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:01:00.000
 Brina was alone with storm, the small fire crackling, casting shadows across the healer and wolfen.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:08.000
 Without a word, Brina took the file, and massaged the fluid into storm's gums and tongue.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:19.000
 "Fuel, novet, alert, ashland, the Argus n'yat," Brina muttered, over and over, her voice sounding like a stick scratching on slate.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:22.000
 Coraline's flesh goosebumped.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:27.000
 The fire seemed to dim and then flare, a twig popped.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:33.000
 The wolf instead, lifting her head to regard Brina with her amber wolf and eyes.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:36.000
 "Come back to us," Brina whispered.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.000
 "Corbin needs you."

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:46.000
 Storm's legs twitched and she gave a weak rumbling growl, then with a sigh, she laid her head back on the turf.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:51.000
 "Thank you," Brina said to Coraline, looking weary.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:57.000
 Dirt skitted about them, and daff, color and leaf appeared out of the darkness, waking feral.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:58.000
 "How is she?"

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
 Daff asked.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.000
 "A little strong, Gar," Brina said.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:07.000
 "We'll take it in turns to watch over her," Farrell said.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:10.000
 "Even you must need to sleep."

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:15.000
 "Well, for once you may be right," Brina muttered.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:19.000
 She curled down beside the fire, pulling her cloak over her head.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:26.000
 "Wake me if there is any change, and no going to sleep on watch."

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:31.000
 A bony finger poked out of the cloak and wagged at them all.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:36.000
 Within moments, Brina's breathing changed, became slower and deeper.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:37.000
 "So?"

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:42.000
 Daff whispered to Coraline once they were all sure that Brina was soundly asleep.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
 "When do we leave?"

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
 "What do you mean?"

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.000
 Coraline asked.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
 "He'll be going after Coraline.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.000
 Where, Coraline, too?"

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:55.800
 Coraline had decided to leave a little before first light to slip away before the camp woke

02:02:55.800 --> 02:02:58.720
 and started asking her questions.

02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:02.000
 She needed to use every moment of daylight possible.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:06.000
 Perhaps, leave a message for Gar.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:09.920
 It was clear that he was needed here, that his duties would force him to stay and oversee

02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:12.000
 the fight against the fair.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.000
 "You can't come," Coraline said.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:19.000
 "Farrel and Laith will be too noisy, too slow."

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:22.000
 Farrel leaned forwards.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
 "Bands, my friend.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
 More than that, closer than kin.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:29.000
 I'm going after him with you or without you."

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:30.000
 He shrugged.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:34.000
 "I'd rather be traveled together, but I'll not be staying here."

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:38.000
 Coraline looked at them all, saw the resolve in their eyes.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:41.000
 "All right then," she said, "before dawn."

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:48.000
 "Morning came grey and damp, false dawn giving a half light that helped Coraline to see beyond

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:53.000
 the fireglow that kept crackling all night to give storm a little warmth."

02:03:53.000 --> 02:04:01.000
 Farrel, daff, color, and Laith had all stayed, taking it in terms to watch over storm.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:08.000
 "Now, silently, they all stood, checked weapons and packs."

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:14.000
 "I would come with you if not for storm," Brynn said, as she stirred within her cloak.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.000
 "We know," Coraline answered.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:20.000
 "Brenner checked on the sleeping wolfen.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:24.000
 Her heart beat stronger," she said.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:28.000
 "That is good news," Coraline grinned.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:33.000
 She crouched beside the wolfen and ran her fingers through the thick fur of her neck,

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:36.000
 then leaned forwards and kissed Storm's head.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:40.000
 "I'll be back with Corbin," she whispered.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:45.000
 "Bring him back," Brynn said, watching them leave.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:49.000
 "I mean to, or die in the trying."

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:52.000
 The camp in the glade above was still in silence.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:56.000
 Coraline and the others picked their way through the sleeping figures.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:01.000
 As they slipped amongst the trees, a figure stepped out in front of them.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:02.000
 "Yeah."

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:07.000
 He had a pack slung across his back, a grim look upon his face.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:11.000
 He nodded as he looked fiercely at the small gathering.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:12.000
 "Good.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
 Let's be after him then."

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:20.000
 "We thought you were needed here that you would have to stay," Coraline said.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
 He gave her a withering look.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:29.000
 "Only death would stop me going after Ban."

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:34.000
 Chapter 8 Corbin

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
 Corbin woke to pain.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:43.000
 He opened his eyes, stared up at a dappled canopy of leaf and branch, gray lights leaking through

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:44.000
 it.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:49.000
 It was passing him by like clouds scuddling across the sky.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
 "No, not the trees.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
 It is eye that I'm moving.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:58.000
 And I am in form," he realized, still in form.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
 He felt relief at that.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:03.000
 Being in form was not such a bad thing.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:07.000
 He liked the forest, and it also meant that he was not a thousand leaks from Drassal

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:11.000
 and his friends if any of them had survived.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:16.000
 But the constant rocking, bumping motion wasn't such a good thing, making his chest spiked

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:21.000
 with pain, and exacerbating the deep, dull throb in his knee, pulsing out in time with

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
 his heartbeat.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:30.000
 Also, there was a terrible stink in his nose musky and stale, making him want a gag.

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:33.000
 Time passed in something of a haze.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:38.000
 His mind drifted and he thought to the other world, it was meeting with my cow.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
 He used me.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
 Manipulated me lied to me.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:48.000
 But his words had also wronged through he needed to find his friends to be at their side.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:49.000
 "How?"

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:52.000
 "That is the question."

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:58.000
 When I am broken and battered, a prisoner travelling early on knows where.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:04.000
 He moved his head slowly from side to side, saw that he was on a makeshift litter that

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:07.000
 was being dragged through the forest.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:12.800
 Behind him, a huge figure loomed, thick with fur, a black snout and muzzle yellow teeth

02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:15.000
 edging its jaw.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.000
 A bear.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:19.000
 One of the jutton's bears.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:24.000
 Their face reared over him, pale and blonde haired, a long braided moustars drooping

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:27.000
 down almost a Corbin's face.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:31.000
 Corbin recognised him as one of the giants that had dragged him away from storm.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:38.000
 "I'll kill you," Corbin hissed, instinctively reaching for his sword.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:43.000
 When his fingers reached the empty scabbard, he remembered that he'd left it in the body of a giant.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:49.000
 Back in the glade where he instalmed Ford and slain three of this giant's kin.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:54.000
 The giant's eyes watched Corbin's gasping breathlessness and grunted.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:08:01.000
 "You'll not be killing any more of us jutton today," the giant said in stilted speech.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:06.000
 "But I like your spirit," he chuckled.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:09.000
 "There's fire in this pub's belly yet."

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:12.000
 "Hala," he called over his shoulder.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:15.000
 "Seems you'll make a healer after all."

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:19.000
 "I've been one for four hundred years," he reared.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:22.000
 A voice called back.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:27.000
 The giant looked back at Corbin and checked the binding of his leg splint, sending jolts

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
 of pain through Corbin.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:33.000
 "Don't go dying on us," the giant said.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:38.000
 "Another giant face appeared beside this one, red-haired and glowering.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:43.000
 "Here, no's wolf and killed her on, a row of fun lot," it rumbled.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:48.000
 Reaching round with the ham the size of a shovel and cuffed in Corbin across the head.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:53.000
 Just the blow was painful enough, but the fire it ignited in Corbin's chest was like a hammer strike,

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:57.000
 and he screamed, the world fading to darkness.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:02.000
 The last sound he heard was giant voices yelling at each other.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:06.000
 "Drink this," a voice said.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:12.000
 Something was shoved into his hand a bowl, and to his surprise he found that he was propped up

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:16.000
 against the trunk of a tree, a rope tying him to the wide bowl.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:19.000
 Not that I can get up and run away.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:25.000
 Two giants were crouched before him, both of them cloaked in a twilight gloom of form.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:29.000
 One of them was the blonde giant he talked to earlier.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:36.000
 Beyond them, he heard the familiar sound of camp making, shadowy figures moving at the edge of his sight.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:43.000
 "Drink," the voice said, a huge hand wrapping around his, and lifting the bowl to his lips.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:49.000
 Corbin sniffed it, wrinkling his nose at the familiar earthly smell.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:52.000
 "Brut," he muttered.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.000
 "You know Brut," the voice said in surprise.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:01.000
 Corbin looked into the gloom and saw that one of the dark figures before him was a woman.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:06.000
 Her face slabs of bone highlighted by the dim gleam of moonlight.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:09.000
 "I," Corbin mumbled.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:12.000
 These sniffed suspiciously at the bowl.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:15.000
 "Go on," the voice said.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:19.000
 "If we wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already."

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
 "That's a fair point."

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
 "My haven't they killed me."

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
 He took a sip.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:29.000
 The brut's closer to porridge in consistency than fluid.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:34.000
 After swallowing, he felt an aftertaste, something bitter.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.000
 "It's not the same," Corbin said.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:38.000
 "As what?"

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
 "As what baller gave me?"

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
 "There was a pause."

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:45.000
 "The giant shared a look."

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:50.000
 "Baller, one eye," the blonde-haired male asked.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
 "I," Corbin said.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
 "Something else in this."

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:55.000
 "Golden seal."

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
 "Another silence."

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
 "I," the female giant said.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.000
 "She or my sounded pleased."

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:05.000
 "Golden seal to fight infection," Corbin always said.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:08.000
 "The worse it tastes, the better it is for you."

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000
 "And ever quite believe that bit."

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:14.000
 Another figure loomed out of the shadows.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:20.000
 "Borgar," the giant rumbled, and his captors parted to let this one crouch down before

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:21.000
 Corbin.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:24.000
 "Adrum," the new arrival said.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:30.000
 An a moment later, Corbin heard flint being struck, sparks catching on a torch and light

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
 flared.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.000
 Corbin blinked.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
 "Look to a moment."

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:39.000
 "Look," had me.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:43.000
 The new voice said, a grating rumble stern and grim.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:46.000
 A hand gripped Corbin's face and lifted his chin.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:50.960
 He was looking at another blonde giant, a thick warrior braiding his hair, threaded

02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:51.960
 with red gold wire.

02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:57.960
 This one had a wide bandage wrapped around his shoulder and chest, a dark stain at its

02:11:57.960 --> 02:11:58.960
 center.

02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:04.960
 "You are ill there, King of the Jotun," Corbin said.

02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:09.960
 "Wallord, not king," ill there, murmured.

02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:13.960
 "verse, who are you?"

02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:16.960
 "Why am I still breathing?"

02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:17.960
 Corbin asked.

02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:20.960
 "A slew your bear, three of your kin in the glade."

02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:22.960
 "With a lot of help from storm.

02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:24.960
 Why would you keep me alive?"

02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:29.960
 "You do not question me."

02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:30.960
 Ill there said.

02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:35.960
 Then with one thick finger, prodig Corbin in his ribs.

02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:37.960
 Corbin suppressed a scream.

02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:41.960
 It came out as a gurgled hiss.

02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:46.360
 Ill there's hand brushed over Corbin's torn circleed, rested on the sigil of the bright

02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:53.360
 star stitched upon his chest, felt his male shirt rolling links between his fingers.

02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:58.760
 He grunted approvingly, then moved onto Corbin's armring, wrapped around his bicep.

02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:00.760
 It had been gifted to him and Drassel.

02:13:00.760 --> 02:13:07.680
 A spiral of dark iron vane with a silver thread, a snarling wolf and head at each end.

02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:09.800
 It was a thing of beauty.

02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:13.760
 More so, because it reminded Corbin of the night back in Drassel, when the whole of the

02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:20.480
 warband had pledged their loyalty to him and he had sworn his oath to them in return.

02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:24.280
 He felt a lump rise in his throat and blinked away tears.

02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:27.840
 "Who are you?"

02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:29.360
 Ill there asked him again.

02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:35.800
 "No one," Corbin grunted, feeling a surge of bitter despair at that admission.

02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:38.560
 Certainly not the bright star everyone believed I was.

02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:40.320
 I even came to believe it.

02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:42.200
 I am the greatest of fools.

02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:44.720
 That is who I am.

02:13:44.720 --> 02:13:48.600
 There is giant skill in this."

02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:53.280
 Ill there observed, fingers running over the spiral of the armring.

02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:57.880
 At Graham's old warriors stood about you.

02:13:57.880 --> 02:14:04.760
 You commanded and others listened, and yesterday men came to save you.

02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:10.000
 He moved closer, face almost touching Corbin's his small dark eye staring.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.720
 I do not think you are no one.

02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:13.720
 Start with your name.

02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:16.160
 Tell me that.

02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:18.280
 Corbin clamped his lips together.

02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:20.760
 I could hurt you.

02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:25.800
 Ill there said, matter of factly, hand opening and resting lightly upon Corbin's injured

02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:26.800
 knee.

02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:30.040
 Corbin sucked in a breath but said nothing.

02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:35.600
 "Your name," Ill there said, flexing his fingers.

02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:40.520
 According to something, Corbin said, as comedies he could manage.

02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:43.920
 Ill there stared at him a long, sweat-filled moment.

02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:50.640
 Then a smile cracked the slabs of the giant's face his mustache twitching.

02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:53.320
 You have stones, little man.

02:14:53.320 --> 02:14:55.480
 I'll give you that.

02:14:55.480 --> 02:15:03.520
 Bargaining with me at a time like this, very well, something for something.

02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:07.200
 Now, what is your name?

02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:13.640
 I am Corbin Ben Thannen, Corbin said, lifting his chin high.

02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:17.280
 That is who I am, my father's son no more no less.

02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:24.440
 At that moment he had never missed his darmore fiercely nor felt so proud of his memory.

02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:29.120
 Ill there nodded thoughtfully, as if he were turning the name over in his mind.

02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:34.600
 "All right, then," the giant finally said, ask your question.

02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:41.560
 "Where are you taking me?" Corbin asked, away from Drassel and his cursed forest.

02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:47.240
 Ill there said, looking up at the shifting shadows in impenetrable trees around them.

02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:48.400
 Where?

02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:52.840
 Corbin repeated, "A place you know well enough.

02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:59.680
 We are going to Graham's hold."

02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:04.920
 Chapter 9 Fidale.

02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:09.360
 Fidale walked the lines of their camp, nodding to guards, offering a word of encouragement

02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:11.160
 here and there.

02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:17.600
 Trees loomed towering colossi that transformed daylight into perpetual twilight.

02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:22.680
 Within this shadowed world, the warband of ripper camped, close to a thousand men, five

02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:25.200
 hundred leagues from home.

02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:29.360
 They must wonder why they are here so far from home, caught up in a war they hardly

02:16:29.360 --> 02:16:33.800
 understand, a war that I barely understand.

02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:40.080
 What she did know, though, was that her son was at the heart of it, in a fair.

02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:44.520
 At the thought of him a tide of emotions swept through her, shock.

02:16:44.520 --> 02:16:50.760
 His allied to the kadashim, my own son, how could he choose to be part of such a great evil?

02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:56.600
 The anger, that he had not chosen differently that he had not stood for what was right.

02:16:56.600 --> 02:17:03.440
 His naive, has trusted, flattering words and deceptive tongues and walked the wrong path.

02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:09.760
 Betrayal, that he had chosen Caledas over her, a point made so clear during her trial.

02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:13.840
 Regret, that she had not seen the course he was treading earlier and done something to

02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:17.480
 help him while there had still been time.

02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:18.480
 Sadness.

02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:24.640
 No, something far deeper than that, more akin to grief.

02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:29.440
 It almost felt as if he had died, that she had lost him forever.

02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:34.800
 Not forever, there is still hope for him, there must be.

02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:36.600
 Hatred.

02:17:36.600 --> 02:17:42.720
 For Caledas, the catalyst and centre of her fury, a kadashim demon made flesh, his will

02:17:42.720 --> 02:17:48.040
 set on corrupting the fair and bending him to his purposes.

02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:51.960
 Traded between and amongst all those emotions was one more.

02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:53.800
 Love.

02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:58.560
 A mother's love for her son, built upon the vulnerable child she had nursed at her breast,

02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:01.320
 whom she had nurtured and protected.

02:18:01.320 --> 02:18:06.040
 A fierce love that had always seen the best in him, that believed in his ability, his

02:18:06.040 --> 02:18:09.760
 strength and intellect believed in him.

02:18:09.760 --> 02:18:13.360
 A love that still fueled a hope that he would eventually see the wrong he had done, that

02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:17.560
 he would turn back from a dark path he was being led down.

02:18:17.560 --> 02:18:22.060
 At the perimeter of their camp, two guards with the eagle of Tannabral upon their breastplate

02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:24.360
 saluted her.

02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:28.160
 Men always stood together in this forest, never alone.

02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:31.360
 The creatures of form were better defended against that way.

02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:37.940
 If he delay stood and stared out into the shadows of the forest, Muemas leave, a voice

02:18:37.940 --> 02:18:41.080
 said beside her, making her jump.

02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:46.360
 Albin, the white haired healer, had followed her, his footsteps a little more than

02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:49.320
 a whisper upon the forest floor.

02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:53.880
 A bandage was wrapped around the wound between his shoulder and chest that the traitorous

02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:58.360
 Ecter had given in the dungeons beneath Briccan.

02:18:58.360 --> 02:19:03.960
 Quiet shy Ecter, rather to crevice in veridus, more accustomed to holding a scroll than

02:19:03.960 --> 02:19:04.960
 a sword.

02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:12.200
 And yet, he had betrayed them and slain one of her most trusted companions, paratus.

02:19:12.200 --> 02:19:16.780
 It had been little more than a ten night ago and her grief was still fresh, but Albin

02:19:16.780 --> 02:19:19.760
 seemed to have recovered well.

02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:26.720
 He is a remarkable man, and a mysterious one, a warrior and a healer both but so much more

02:19:26.720 --> 02:19:31.320
 than that, friend to my cow, part of a secret group that has been waiting for these days

02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:32.320
 preparing.

02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:37.680
 "Uemas leave," Albin repeated, "Time is against us."

02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:43.880
 "No," she replied, an automatic response.

02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:47.400
 She drew in a long breath composing herself.

02:19:47.400 --> 02:19:52.040
 This wall band will not just march away from crellis, they are men of ripper.

02:19:52.040 --> 02:19:58.520
 "They'll do what you order them to do," Albin said quietly, "you are their queen."

02:19:58.520 --> 02:20:01.040
 "I don't want to be queen."

02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:07.640
 "So many years I put duty first," she looked at Albin, saw him studying her face.

02:20:08.640 --> 02:20:10.960
 "He knows why I do not wish to leave."

02:20:10.960 --> 02:20:15.840
 "I'll not leave," without McIn.

02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:22.320
 The warrior's face filled her mind, beaten and scarred, proud, fierce.

02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:26.560
 She felt her spirits lift at the thought of him, remembered sitting at his side in the

02:20:26.560 --> 02:20:33.160
 tower at ripper when he had opened his eyes after lying on the brink of death for so long.

02:20:33.160 --> 02:20:37.400
 She had told her that he'd stood upon the bridge of swords that one of the Ben-Elem had given

02:20:37.400 --> 02:20:39.160
 him a choice.

02:20:39.160 --> 02:20:42.760
 To cross over, or go back, he'd told her.

02:20:42.760 --> 02:20:46.880
 "Why did you come back then?" she'd asked him.

02:20:46.880 --> 02:20:48.440
 Three reasons.

02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:50.000
 Three people.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:54.080
 "Jail, like us, you."

02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:57.040
 He had paused and looked up into her eyes.

02:20:57.040 --> 02:20:59.040
 Two for vengeance.

02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:01.720
 One for love.

02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:05.840
 Her lips twitched in a smile at the memory of it.

02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:08.520
 Albin's eyes creased with worry in perhaps compassion.

02:21:08.520 --> 02:21:13.520
 "You'll lose this war, for one man."

02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:17.240
 So many answers flashed through her mind, most of them convincing in their own right, but

02:21:17.240 --> 02:21:19.240
 she knew they were not the truth.

02:21:19.240 --> 02:21:23.400
 "It will not come to that," she snapped.

02:21:23.400 --> 02:21:24.400
 Albin frowned.

02:21:24.400 --> 02:21:29.520
 "You can't all choose one man, over a nation," he said.

02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:32.640
 Some more than that, her whole of the banish lands.

02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:34.400
 We are in the God-war.

02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:36.840
 We cannot just walk away from this.

02:21:36.840 --> 02:21:41.360
 It will consume the banish lands, and when it is done, those who stand against us rough

02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:44.720
 will either be victorious, or they will be dead.

02:21:44.720 --> 02:21:46.600
 There is nothing in between.

02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:48.520
 It is war.

02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:49.960
 Sacrifices must be made.

02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:56.840
 "I am familiar with sacrifice," she said coldly, "but I'll not be a pawn to an absent

02:21:56.840 --> 02:21:57.840
 God."

02:21:58.160 --> 02:22:01.920
 "I'll fight for my freedom, for my people, and follow my conscience.

02:22:01.920 --> 02:22:06.400
 Yes, I fear for my keen, and I long for his return, but more than that this warband

02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:10.480
 is stronger with him and with Krellus."

02:22:10.480 --> 02:22:13.840
 And there it is, if they managed to find him.

02:22:13.840 --> 02:22:15.800
 We must give them more time.

02:22:15.800 --> 02:22:23.880
 "They may never return," my lady, Albin said quietly, voicing her deepest fear.

02:22:23.880 --> 02:22:27.640
 "Doubt and worry, nor did her."

02:22:27.640 --> 02:22:32.280
 She remembered standing on the riverbank beyond Brickhand's Tower as the warband escaped

02:22:32.280 --> 02:22:37.480
 deeper into the forest, camouflaged, amongst Nefair's warriors.

02:22:37.480 --> 02:22:42.720
 McIn, Albin and Krellus had stood with her, looking back at the tower, thinking of Veridis

02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:48.960
 and what he had vowed to do, to slay Caledus, one of the Calishim.

02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:52.800
 They had all seen the explosion of fire light up the tower window and moments later seen

02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:56.840
 the forms leak from it, hurtling into the river.

02:22:56.840 --> 02:22:57.840
 It was Veridis.

02:22:57.840 --> 02:22:59.600
 They were sure.

02:22:59.600 --> 02:23:06.040
 McIn and Krellus had made to rush after him then and there, but Albin had stayed them

02:23:06.040 --> 02:23:11.400
 a while, calling out names and gathering a score of men to go with them.

02:23:11.400 --> 02:23:14.000
 McIn had crushed her in a tight embrace.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:17.280
 "Stay," she'd whispered in his ear.

02:23:17.280 --> 02:23:23.240
 "The Veridis is my friend," McIn had replied, "and he freed us."

02:23:23.240 --> 02:23:29.480
 He'd held his gaze a long heartfelt moment and then he was gone, running into the night.

02:23:29.480 --> 02:23:31.520
 Was that our last moment together?

02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:38.520
 "My lady," one of the guards close by said, pointing into the darkness of form forest.

02:23:38.520 --> 02:23:40.000
 Someone approaches.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:45.240
 "If you'd lay stared into the shadows, Albin tents beside her, a fist clamped around the

02:23:45.240 --> 02:23:46.400
 hilt of his sword.

02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:51.600
 One of the guards had raised a horn to his lips ready to sound the call to arms.

02:23:52.600 --> 02:23:56.400
 A figures separated from the gloom, dark silhouettes.

02:23:56.400 --> 02:24:02.120
 Six, seven, then one more, looming behind the others, dwarfing them.

02:24:02.120 --> 02:24:04.200
 A giant.

02:24:04.200 --> 02:24:08.200
 Swords were scraping from scabbards, then fiddily recognised the first figure as it passed

02:24:08.200 --> 02:24:11.080
 through a beam of daylight.

02:24:11.080 --> 02:24:16.400
 Albin reached a hand out to the guard with a horn to his lips and pulled the horn away.

02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:20.200
 One of the scouts whom Albin since watched the road.

02:24:20.200 --> 02:24:24.320
 He was leading a group through the forest towards their camp.

02:24:24.320 --> 02:24:29.400
 She felt her pulse quicken as her eyes scanned the shapes behind him, and then she

02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:35.280
 was running, pushing past the guards, ferns and branches whipping at her face.

02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:40.360
 Another figure was moving ahead of the scout running towards her, a loping stride, all controlled

02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:43.160
 strength and grace.

02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:49.000
 Makin. He opened his stride and ran ahead of the others meeting fiddily between two great

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:55.360
 oaks. They fell into each other, Makin's arms gripping her around the waist and crushing

02:24:55.360 --> 02:25:01.360
 her against him. Her lips found his, and the next few moments were lost to the scent

02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:06.360
 and taste of him. Eventually she heard the others approaching and stepped back, hands

02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:12.400
 still holding his, and looked at him. He was sweat stained, hair pressed dark against his

02:25:12.400 --> 02:25:19.520
 head, and he was smiling at her, softening the hard lines and scars upon his face.

02:25:19.520 --> 02:25:23.040
 He reached out and brushed a strand of hair from her cheek.

02:25:23.040 --> 02:25:29.800
 "Now, that's a greeting worth fighting demons from the other world for," he said.

02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:36.240
 "Even if it is most uncleanly behaviour," I glanced at knowledge the eyes

02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:44.280
 gathering upon them. "I am more than just a queen," Fiddily said with a shrug, and besides,

02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:49.400
 in these times, death feels never more than a few steps behind us.

02:25:49.400 --> 02:25:56.860
 While I still draw breath, I lift my life as I choose. Her eyes drifted to his bare arm

02:25:56.860 --> 02:26:02.000
 a jagged wound hastily stitched. It looked more like an animal bite than the product

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:09.600
 of a weapon. The edges were torn and bloodied. He saw her gaze upon the injury and shrugged

02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:14.160
 riley. "Can you never come back to me without a fresh wound?"

02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:19.840
 "It's a bad habit, I must confess," he smiled at her.

02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:24.600
 The others gathered about them now, and Fiddily saw crillest standing with veridus, the bulk

02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:30.480
 of LC on the giant behind them. They were both blood stained and sweating, exhausted, but

02:26:30.480 --> 02:26:35.840
 both of them were grinning at Albin, as the old warrior hugged them both.

02:26:35.840 --> 02:26:39.840
 There was a crashing behind her, and they all turned to see rain of a giant sess of her

02:26:39.840 --> 02:26:43.160
 bare and plowing through the undergrowth towards them.

02:26:43.160 --> 02:26:47.760
 LC pushed past crillest and veridus, sending them flying, and met his family with an inhuman

02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:53.080
 howl, their arms rapping around one another, holding, squeezing as if they were becoming

02:26:53.080 --> 02:26:58.040
 one. Slowly, they sank to their knees, still entwined, a shuddering sound pulsating

02:26:58.040 --> 02:27:05.280
 from them. LC on the sobs. He held their faces, smothered them both with kisses, wife

02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:11.600
 and son, and their tears and smiles mingled with his. In such dark times as these it

02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:16.880
 was heartwarming to see such love. She gripped Maki in his hand more tightly in her

02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:21.040
 own. If only such happiness could last.

02:27:21.040 --> 02:27:27.520
 "So, what now?" Crillest asked them. The small gathering were sitting around the burned

02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:33.680
 out remains of a fire pit in the centre of their camp. "We must go to Dresil," Albin said.

02:27:33.680 --> 02:27:39.760
 "Most way?" Crillest asked, looking around at them all. "I'm not one to walk away from

02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:46.760
 my fights, but I've just lost 19 men to," his voice trailed off.

02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:53.720
 To demons of the other world, veridus said, to the caddish him. Still can't quite believe

02:27:53.720 --> 02:27:59.880
 it. Crillest muttered. Wiping her hand across his eyes. "I'm not one for fairy tales,"

02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:06.360
 he said, "but I know what I saw. My blade, in an enemy's heart, and the bloody creature

02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:09.280
 just smiled at me."

02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:14.600
 I act to take his head to stop him trying to rip my throat out. I saw winged things

02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:20.440
 have missed and shadow forming above the headless corpses. He shook his head. "If we go

02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:27.000
 to Dresil, it sounds as if we'll fess an army of these things. My men are warriors,

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:34.240
 bread for battle, brave, and true hearted. But they are only men of flesh and blood."

02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:44.320
 So, I must ask this question. His gaze returned to Albin. "Is this our fight?"

02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:52.640
 Albin nodded. "It is," he said. "This is the god-war, Crillest. My cow and the bright star

02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:57.560
 are there, so Dresil must be where it will be decided."

02:28:57.560 --> 02:29:04.120
 The battle is more slightly already over, Crillest said. N affair and his allies have at

02:29:04.120 --> 02:29:07.000
 least a ten nights march on us.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:14.200
 "If we do not go, who else will?" Albin said. "It is our duty to go."

02:29:14.200 --> 02:29:20.120
 "My duty is to my men," Crillest said, waving a hand at the wall-band about them.

02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:26.080
 "And to the people of Tenabral, we are less than a thousand souls. We cannot win."

02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:30.560
 As to changing man would withdraw, live to fight another day when the odds are more

02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:31.560
 in our favour.

02:29:31.560 --> 02:29:38.360
 "There will not be another day if we do not fight now," Albin said.

02:29:38.360 --> 02:29:43.600
 The Calidus and the fair will destroy our allies one by one. We must stand with those

02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:47.360
 who oppose them now before it is too late.

02:29:47.360 --> 02:29:52.760
 And what if there is none of these allies left alive at Dresil by the time we get there?

02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:57.160
 "We will not know unless we go there," Albin replied.

02:29:57.160 --> 02:30:02.200
 "A silent lengthened, all looking between Crillest and Albin."

02:30:02.200 --> 02:30:08.360
 "Well, maybe your right," Crillest eventually said, nodding thoughtfully.

02:30:08.360 --> 02:30:15.040
 "I've always come to you when it's wisdom I've been looking for. But what if you're

02:30:15.040 --> 02:30:16.680
 wrong?"

02:30:16.680 --> 02:30:22.320
 Marching deep into the heart of Thorne into unknown ground against a foe that outnumbers

02:30:22.320 --> 02:30:29.080
 us greatly. That's not wisdom. Not when we could retreat and choose our own ground, but

02:30:29.080 --> 02:30:33.120
 still this is a fight we must all agree to.

02:30:33.120 --> 02:30:41.720
 "Say it to all of you. Ask you all, as my brothers in arms, are you for this fight here?

02:30:41.720 --> 02:30:47.360
 Now are you for Dresil? Are you for home?"

02:30:47.360 --> 02:30:52.520
 Home thoughtfully. Part of me longs to find a place of peace with Meckin where this

02:30:52.520 --> 02:30:58.800
 war cannot touch us. But is there a place far enough from this war to escape it?

02:30:58.800 --> 02:31:04.400
 And even if there were, I would not abandon the people of Tenorbroul to death and torment.

02:31:04.400 --> 02:31:09.520
 And then there is an affair. But ever he has done, he is still my son, I cannot just leave

02:31:09.520 --> 02:31:10.520
 him.

02:31:10.520 --> 02:31:15.600
 "Well," Crillest said, dragging Fridolay from her thoughts.

02:31:15.600 --> 02:31:22.520
 "We are friends here. Equals. We have not been ordered by our Lord or King. We are

02:31:22.520 --> 02:31:25.040
 free to choose."

02:31:25.040 --> 02:31:31.160
 Crillest put it to the votes. "As for Me, I say we leave this forest behind us. Back

02:31:31.160 --> 02:31:34.760
 to Tenorbroul to raise more swords and choose our battle ground.

02:31:34.760 --> 02:31:37.240
 "I am for Dresil," Albin said.

02:31:37.240 --> 02:31:45.040
 "If Fidolay looked around the fire-pits or all lost in their own deliberations, I would

02:31:45.040 --> 02:31:50.640
 go to Dresil," she thought, "to save my son and for vengeance upon like us. But Crillest

02:31:50.640 --> 02:31:58.440
 speaks wisdom. What have you, little brother?" Crillest asked. "Are you for the great tree,

02:31:58.440 --> 02:32:03.720
 of a hall on the bay? There it is finally raised his head and regarded them all with

02:32:03.720 --> 02:32:10.840
 his dark, serious eyes. I have been full, been deceived and committed dark deeds in

02:32:10.840 --> 02:32:17.840
 the name of good." His face twisted with a bit of grimace as he looked at his open palms.

02:32:17.840 --> 02:32:27.600
 I would do what I can to put that right. Verity has continued, "But how?" he

02:32:27.600 --> 02:32:33.800
 mused. "My heart says Dresil. My head says home. Crillest is right. We do not know

02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:37.520
 what awaits or such, Dresil, though. I do know this."

02:32:37.520 --> 02:32:43.600
 "Cally does, has charged jail of Iseltier, Gondel of Carnotan and Lothar of Helveth to

02:32:43.600 --> 02:32:50.040
 build roads to Dresil, and with them they bring the full might of their realms. If we

02:32:50.040 --> 02:32:53.720
 managed to make the long journey through fawn, we would face impossible odds at the end

02:32:53.720 --> 02:32:54.720
 of it."

02:32:54.720 --> 02:33:02.480
 "Not if my car on the bright star still stand," Altman said. "And if they have fallen,"

02:33:02.480 --> 02:33:09.120
 Crillest said. "You are advising us to do the opposite of all you of torts. Know your

02:33:09.120 --> 02:33:14.520
 enemy. Choose your ground, that's what you've always told me."

02:33:14.520 --> 02:33:17.860
 Crillest shook his head. "I know," Altman admitted.

02:33:17.860 --> 02:33:24.680
 "What of you?" Crillest asked, shifting his gaze to Altian and the Giants.

02:33:24.680 --> 02:33:28.540
 Raina was cutting Altian's hair with her knife, leaving the top long and thick, the

02:33:28.540 --> 02:33:30.640
 side shaved to the skin.

02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:35.760
 "What is she doing to him?" He looked more fearsome than ever before.

02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:43.920
 "We will travel with you, whichever way you go. If you will have us," Altian said.

02:33:43.920 --> 02:33:51.120
 "And why would you wish to join us?" Crillest asked. "I is narrowing. Why not just leave

02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:59.240
 now and go back to your clan? So reasons," Altian said. His voice like gravel. A blood

02:33:59.240 --> 02:34:08.080
 is dead, he glanced at veridis, and a blood feud. As he said the last, his fists clenched,

02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:09.320
 knuckles popping.

02:34:09.320 --> 02:34:19.760
 "Calidus made me a slave. Kept my family prisoner. I would even that score, fight him now,

02:34:19.760 --> 02:34:28.520
 fight him later." Altian shrugged. "As long as I fight him, I cannot. If you don't

02:34:28.520 --> 02:34:36.240
 mind me asking," Crillest added to Altian. By the new aircoat. Altian rubbed the side of

02:34:36.240 --> 02:34:41.040
 his head, stubble, rasping on his palm, the hair on the top of his head, a thick wedge.

02:34:41.040 --> 02:34:49.480
 "This is my clan's tradition. When Calidus caught me and bent me to his will, I was

02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:59.800
 Kergan no longer. I did not deserve the mark of my clan, but now I am Kergan again."

02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:01.440
 He smiled viciously.

02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:09.280
 "Now the course is clear," Fiddellay said. "The wisdom suggests we retreat. Are there

02:35:09.280 --> 02:35:10.760
 any other options?"

02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:18.640
 "We could fight now," McKeene said. All eyes turned to him. The grizzled warrior looked

02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:25.400
 at his hands, turning them over. Fiddellay beside him saw the calluses and scars. "In

02:35:25.400 --> 02:35:32.520
 the pit I have faced one foe, and I have faced many foes. It is always easier against

02:35:32.520 --> 02:35:41.080
 one. I saw him fight four men and slay them all. Against many, I strike fast. Before

02:35:41.080 --> 02:35:47.760
 they have a chance to join against me, and I strike hard to kill with one blow."

02:35:47.760 --> 02:35:55.880
 "I, but this is no pits. This is foreign forest. And our enemies are not lining up before

02:35:55.880 --> 02:35:58.280
 us," Critters growled.

02:35:58.280 --> 02:36:06.000
 "They will be, if we allow them to. But one of them is close to us, cut off from the

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:12.720
 other's gundling the war band of connetanna out there, close, building a road, distracted,

02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:18.160
 spread out with their backs to us. We'll likely fight him one day, though next time

02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:24.800
 we see him, we'll probably be with half the realms of the banish lands at his back.

02:36:24.800 --> 02:36:30.760
 Whether we go to Dressel, or walk away, I say we have an opportunity here to even the

02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:38.120
 gods a little, an opportunity would be fools to miss. And besides, he added, "There's

02:36:38.120 --> 02:36:43.920
 nothing like a good fight to clear their mind."

02:36:43.920 --> 02:36:46.920
 CHAPTER X

02:36:46.920 --> 02:36:50.920
 J.L.

02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:55.800
 J.L. stumbled, and almost fell, swearing under his breath as he reached out to grab a thick

02:36:55.800 --> 02:37:00.280
 branch. I hate this forest.

02:37:00.280 --> 02:37:05.680
 And he steadied himself, pausing to wipe sweat from his brow and catch a few breaths.

02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:09.720
 His huntsman, Dag, was summer up ahead, setting a grueling pate as they marched through

02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:18.240
 foreign forest. How many nights have we lived in this twilight nightmare? 20? 30? 100?

02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:25.440
 Will it ever end? A line of warriors was strung before and behind him. A few hundred

02:37:25.440 --> 02:37:30.240
 men, the only survivors of his war band that are marked so proudly to the gates of Dressel.

02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:38.320
 Thousand strong, the might of Isalty are now broken, slain or scattered. And a third of those

02:37:38.320 --> 02:37:44.120
 he fled with mere fallen since then to the forest and to its inhabitants. He shuddered at

02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:48.800
 the memory of finding guards gray and lifeless, their blood drained like juice from a ripe

02:37:48.800 --> 02:37:53.240
 fruit, nothing much more left of them than skin and bone.

02:37:53.240 --> 02:38:00.160
 How did it come to this? Victory was so close, Dressel, almost mine. How did that boy

02:38:00.160 --> 02:38:05.280
 defeat Sumur? He ground his teeth at the memory of Corbin taking the

02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:11.760
 catachim's head in single combat. It had been a blow, he could not deny, and it had done

02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:17.800
 little for the morale of jail's war band. So jail had ordered his finest warriors,

02:38:17.800 --> 02:38:23.640
 his personal guard, to swarm Corbin and slay him. Sure victory had seemed mere heartbeats

02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:28.880
 away, but then the gates of Dressel had opened that devil, wolfin and the stallion galloping

02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:35.040
 out the head of a host of giants and sword-waving lunatics. It had all gone downhill from

02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:43.680
 there. That had been when jail had made the decision to retreat. Retreat, not flee. A strategic

02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:50.160
 withdrawal. Better to retreat and live to fight another day. And that is what I shall

02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:57.160
 do here. Retreat to Isalty a raise a fresh war band fight to hold on to what I have achieved.

02:38:57.160 --> 02:39:03.680
 My lord, a voice said behind him. A sweat-soaked warrior was giving him a concerned frown.

02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:11.600
 "What?" jail snapped irritably. "The line, my king." The warrior said, jerking his

02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:17.280
 head forwards. Jail realized the warriors had been following were still moving, disappearing

02:39:17.280 --> 02:39:22.760
 into the foliage and shadows. Fear jolted him into movement the thought of being stranded

02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:29.000
 in the forest without Dag to guide him was a horror he had no wish to endure. He hastened

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:33.540
 on, limbs heavy and leaden, catching up with the men ahead then he was settling back

02:39:33.540 --> 02:39:39.360
 into the monotonous march, his eyes fixed on the heels of the man in front of him.

02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:44.280
 Whispering a head caused jail to look up from the ground. Dag was moving back down the

02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:49.960
 line, patting a shoulder here, paused into so few words there. Never thought of him

02:39:49.960 --> 02:39:56.700
 as lead a material. For some reason the thought irritated jail, always seemed a cologneer,

02:39:56.700 --> 02:40:02.760
 and those scars on his face don't make him more pleasant to be around. The huntsman eventually

02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:09.440
 reached jail. "You have news," jail asked. The shame to the desperation and hopefully

02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:17.440
 tried to keep from his voice. "I," Dag said, "there's men up ahead."

02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:21.560
 Jail peered through dense undergrowth. For a moment struggling to understand what he

02:40:21.560 --> 02:40:29.080
 was seeing. Only a dozen or so paces away, the undergrowth ended. A man made clearing dotted

02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:35.320
 with cut tree stumps, lead towards an embankment. Men, hundreds of them, were swarming over

02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:40.360
 the embankment which stretches far as he could see in both directions. They were working,

02:40:40.360 --> 02:40:45.080
 many wielding long handled axes and hammers were rising and falling, the rhythmic thud

02:40:45.080 --> 02:40:52.320
 of their blows drumming through the forest. They're building a road. It must be loathar,

02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:57.680
 or gondle, still building to reach dressill and win the race that I had already won. Just

02:40:57.680 --> 02:41:03.320
 looking at the industriousness of what could only be his allies even if they were also rivals

02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:10.040
 and jail's mind, he began to feel something resolved confidence returning. I am safe, safe

02:41:10.040 --> 02:41:17.320
 from the forest, safe from pursuit. With me," he said to Dag, as he pushed his way through

02:41:17.320 --> 02:41:23.480
 the undergrowth. He paused a moment, stood straighter and adjusted his tattered cloak, allowing

02:41:23.480 --> 02:41:29.000
 his men to gather behind him, then marched across the clearing towards the embankment. The

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:34.280
 alarm was sounded when he was spotted, and warriors rapidly appeared clad in mail in brandishing

02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:41.160
 swords and spears. Quirasses and banners bore the emblem of a burning torch upon a pale

02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:49.240
 field. Gondle's war band, then. Excellent. He is far weaker than loathar, a much easier

02:41:49.240 --> 02:41:54.920
 to manipulate. Jail strode to a warrior standing amidst what was rapidly becoming a bristling

02:41:54.920 --> 02:42:01.240
 head of sharp iron already imagining that they were his warriors, his war band. Take me

02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:07.920
 to your king!" Jail demanded imperiously. Jail pulls for a moment from a road down which

02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:12.880
 warriors of Chinatown were leading him. He'd walked a good half-league away from the forefront

02:42:12.880 --> 02:42:16.720
 of his new road, built upon a fresh-powered embankment with the forest stripped back to

02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:23.400
 either side. Wains were moving up and down the road, warriors lining it. Gondle's camper

02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:28.040
 appeared, a sprawling mast of the south of the new road at its centre, a huge tent upon

02:42:28.040 --> 02:42:35.880
 a low hill. How many? He whispered to Dag. He strode a step behind him. The rest of his

02:42:35.880 --> 02:42:42.200
 tattered war band had been left at the side of the road. Three, four thousand swords. The

02:42:42.200 --> 02:42:48.400
 husband said with a shrug, hard to tail with all the other hangs on. They weaved through

02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:53.200
 the camp, a host of sounds and smells of sailing jail as he was guided through a maze

02:42:53.200 --> 02:42:59.520
 of tents and cook fires, cattle load from paddocks, the stink of human habitation wafting towards

02:42:59.520 --> 02:43:05.840
 him. After being a refugee in this otherworldly and oppressive forest for so long, he felt

02:43:05.840 --> 02:43:13.200
 almost overwhelmed by it. The tent, jail, had spied from the road rose up before him,

02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:19.200
 larger than it had at first appeared. His escort of a few score warriors led him purposefully

02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:25.560
 towards it. Gondle. A circle of pale skinned and black-eyed warriors

02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:30.720
 stood guard about the tent, clothed in dark mail and leather, curved swords arching over

02:43:30.720 --> 02:43:37.320
 their shoulders. Nothair's Gihar. A score of them had marched with his own war band

02:43:37.320 --> 02:43:43.000
 with Sumor as their captain. He remembered Sumor a skill in battle, the fury of the others

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:48.760
 as they had charged into battle. And the winged things that poured from them like poison

02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:56.680
 when they fell, his skin crawled. Whatever they are, they are not men, but whatever they are,

02:43:56.680 --> 02:44:04.400
 they still died, still failed me, so much for Nothair's great warriors. He felt an irrational

02:44:04.400 --> 02:44:10.360
 anger about that, even as he felt fear and revulsion crawling across his skin. He regarded

02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:16.840
 the Gihar before him suspiciously. "What are you?" "Respect them. Don't fear them.

02:44:16.840 --> 02:44:21.960
 You remind them, self." They died the same as the rest of us, Sumor

02:44:21.960 --> 02:44:27.920
 felt a corbin, and the rare snow-doubt during the battle before the gates of dressill.

02:44:27.920 --> 02:44:33.680
 A pair of warriors parted before jail. One opened the tent flap and jail, entered,

02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:39.520
 dagged, still a step behind. The tent was luxuriously furnished, thick furs carpeting

02:44:39.520 --> 02:44:45.320
 the ground and gold trim tapestries, draping the walls. Perfined candles burned, their

02:44:45.320 --> 02:44:52.200
 sent thick and heavy in the air. Gondall was sitting on a wide-backed chair, one leg drugged

02:44:52.200 --> 02:44:58.320
 across the chair's arm. Women clad in diaphanous silk, feeding him from various platters.

02:44:58.320 --> 02:45:03.560
 The handful of young men lounged about him, their hair and veered slick and shining

02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:10.240
 with oil, all of them were immaculately dressed in velvets and soft skins. Look at them,

02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:14.240
 fawning sycophants gathered about the pot of gold, not a single one of them looks like

02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:17.240
 they've held a blade in battle.

02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:19.240
 jail suppressed a sneer.

02:45:19.240 --> 02:45:24.240
 "Well met, Gondall," he said, as he strode forwards.

02:45:24.240 --> 02:45:31.200
 Gondall studied him, a blank expression replaced slowly with recognition. He shifted in his

02:45:31.200 --> 02:45:34.200
 chair but did not rise.

02:45:34.200 --> 02:45:41.220
 "Well, if it isn't jail of his yelter," Gondall said, a flaccid smile spreading across his

02:45:41.220 --> 02:45:48.240
 face. King of Isletir, jail silently corrected as he returned a force smile.

02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:55.200
 "I did not recognize you," Gondall said, taking a long moment to look jail up and down.

02:45:55.200 --> 02:46:00.120
 jail was abruptly aware of his appearance. When he rode to the gates of Drassel, he had

02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:06.040
 been dressed in his finest war gear. A coat of gleaming chainmail, sabled cloak trimmed

02:46:06.040 --> 02:46:14.460
 with fur, britches, and boots of doe skin. Now his cloak was mud-crusted and in tatters. His

02:46:14.460 --> 02:46:19.660
 chainmail smeared and rusting his face and arms griming and scratched beyond counting.

02:46:19.660 --> 02:46:26.140
 "What a wonderful surprise," Gondall said with a barely-discite smirk. "I had heard that

02:46:26.140 --> 02:46:31.100
 you were lost, presumed dead after your defeat by the rabble at Drassel, I rejoiced

02:46:31.100 --> 02:46:36.580
 that you live." "Then why do you look so disappointed? Already

02:46:36.580 --> 02:46:42.380
 planning the annexation of my realm, I guess?" Nothing made jail angry at them thought

02:46:42.380 --> 02:46:47.780
 of someone else stealing the realm he had so recently stolen for himself. He suppressed

02:46:47.780 --> 02:46:52.100
 the urge to wrap his fingers around Gondall's throat. If he thinks he can take Isletir

02:46:52.100 --> 02:46:58.820
 from me, I will make him inked his own intestines. "A sentiment, I share. I can assure

02:46:58.820 --> 02:47:05.740
 you," jail said, strapping his smile upon his face. The enemy at Drassel used film magic

02:47:05.740 --> 02:47:11.520
 against us. Alas, brave hearts and strong arms were not enough against the dark powers of

02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:17.420
 Azeroth's black son. "Really?" Gondall said, the more genuine

02:47:17.420 --> 02:47:24.340
 smile twitching his lips. He sat straighter in his chair. Nefair had little trouble against

02:47:24.340 --> 02:47:31.060
 their fel magic. "What do you mean?" jail asked. King Nefair took

02:47:31.060 --> 02:47:36.620
 Drassel over a ten-night to go, the enemy are broken and scattered. "What? The war

02:47:36.620 --> 02:47:42.060
 is over. Well, from what I hear there is some resistance still but little more than the

02:47:42.060 --> 02:47:47.100
 death throes of a foe that has not realized it's already lost."

02:47:47.100 --> 02:47:52.700
 The war over and my own warband defeated. I had hoped for more time to return to Isletir

02:47:52.700 --> 02:47:58.260
 and raise a new warband, fresh battles, and win some glory before the war was ended. But

02:47:58.260 --> 02:48:05.860
 now that is wonderful news." jail said, speaking through a fixed grin, "I can see that

02:48:05.860 --> 02:48:12.660
 your old building is going well. If I could ask one favor, what do you want?" Gondall

02:48:12.660 --> 02:48:19.140
 asked, looking suddenly bored with the conversation. He thinks we broken. A defeated rival

02:48:19.140 --> 02:48:26.140
 of no consequence. Jail stopped his teeth from grinding. "Horses for myself and my men, an

02:48:26.140 --> 02:48:33.140
 escort back to Isletir. Your men?" Gondall sniffed. Looking disdainfully at DAG

02:48:33.140 --> 02:48:39.860
 used to it silently behind jail. One of the young men gathered about Gondall sniggered.

02:48:39.860 --> 02:48:44.740
 "Come. Get what you need. Just remember the sycophant's face."

02:48:44.740 --> 02:48:53.900
 "Yes, King Gondall," jail said, and his most comradly voice. "My warband are currently resting

02:48:53.900 --> 02:49:02.940
 after their exertions. How many?" Gondall frowned. "Around 300," jail said. "I'm not

02:49:02.940 --> 02:49:09.220
 sure that counts as a warband." Gondall smiled, slyly, and jail's fingers twitched. But

02:49:09.220 --> 02:49:15.020
 even so 300 horses are doubt I can spare so many. All my resources are going into building

02:49:15.020 --> 02:49:19.420
 this road you understand. I will reach Jostle before Lothar."

02:49:19.420 --> 02:49:27.340
 So that race is still on. "But perhaps we can help each other," then jail said.

02:49:27.340 --> 02:49:33.420
 "How could you possibly help me?" Gondall sneered. Looking pointedly at jail's

02:49:33.420 --> 02:49:41.940
 tattered appearance. Jail bit back a harsh response as stood straighter. "I am still the king

02:49:41.940 --> 02:49:49.380
 of Iseltier. I could bring fresh workers to build your road. Two thousand at least, maybe

02:49:49.380 --> 02:49:55.260
 more." Gondall smiled broadened, and he sat straight in his chair waving away the servants

02:49:55.260 --> 02:50:01.580
 offering him platters of food. "You shall have your horses," he said.

02:50:01.580 --> 02:50:05.980
 Jail opened his mouth to speak but paused. The faint sound of shouting was filtering through

02:50:05.980 --> 02:50:11.180
 the tent's opening. Gondall heard it too, and held his hand up to a man who was trying

02:50:11.180 --> 02:50:18.180
 to whisper in his ear. The noises rapidly grew louder, shouts turning to screens, punctuated

02:50:18.180 --> 02:50:24.140
 with the distinct sound of iron clashing. Jail glanced at Dagg, who stood poised like an

02:50:24.140 --> 02:50:30.060
 animal on the edge of flight, one hand upon the hilt of his dagger. "We need to leave."

02:50:30.060 --> 02:50:37.260
 Against the Huntsman, his to jail. "What is that?" Gondall snapped, standing, fear and worry flickering

02:50:37.260 --> 02:50:43.500
 across his features. "It is battle, something that I don't think you are fully acquainted

02:50:43.500 --> 02:50:50.620
 with." Gondall stroked from the tent. His gaggler followers tied behind him. Jail and

02:50:50.620 --> 02:50:56.980
 Dagg slipped out after them. Outside, Gondall was stood on the slope of the hill, staring

02:50:56.980 --> 02:51:02.460
 with a look of confused disbelief towards the northern fringe of his camp. Warriors were

02:51:02.460 --> 02:51:08.820
 pouring onto the road from its far side, cutting into the milling guards and workers.

02:51:08.820 --> 02:51:13.620
 Jail saw resistance, legislatively forming. Warriors from Gondall's war band attempting

02:51:13.620 --> 02:51:17.820
 to form a defensive line across the road, but before they could organise themselves, they

02:51:17.820 --> 02:51:23.660
 were locked in combat with their assailants. Within moments, the attackers had burst through

02:51:23.660 --> 02:51:28.380
 their hastily-formed resistance and were streaming down the embankment into the camp.

02:51:28.380 --> 02:51:35.580
 "Assroth stones, what now?" The Geeha on the hillside were drawing close about Gondall,

02:51:35.580 --> 02:51:42.580
 black eyes staring. "We need to get out of here," Dagg repeated. "What's going on?"

02:51:42.580 --> 02:51:49.180
 Gondall cried, part temper, part hysteria. "It would appear you were right,"

02:51:49.180 --> 02:51:53.420
 and Jail said, not able to keep the smirk from his face at the sound of terror in

02:51:53.420 --> 02:51:58.060
 Gondall's voice even though he felt the coils of fear squirming in his own belly.

02:51:58.060 --> 02:52:03.860
 "The enemy that you said did not know they were beaten, that they appeared to be attacking

02:52:03.860 --> 02:52:08.140
 you."

02:52:08.140 --> 02:52:10.140
 CHAPTER 11

02:52:10.140 --> 02:52:13.380
 Makin

02:52:13.380 --> 02:52:17.900
 Makin gazed through foliage at the sprawling camp, feeling his body tense and fingers

02:52:17.900 --> 02:52:22.380
 twitched for his knife-hilt as he watched Crellus' men appear on the road and engaged

02:52:22.380 --> 02:52:24.140
 Gondall's men.

02:52:24.140 --> 02:52:29.020
 "Crouch on the far south of the camp, he saw a few dozen enemy guards standing with their

02:52:29.020 --> 02:52:34.840
 backs to him in an open space cleared between the camp and the tree-line. They looked

02:52:34.840 --> 02:52:41.820
 unsure of what to do. The man beside Makin gripped his sword and took a step forwards.

02:52:41.820 --> 02:52:49.660
 "Wait," Makin whispered, seizing the warrior's arm. "Not till Crellus hits the camp."

02:52:49.660 --> 02:52:55.420
 Makin had been given the command of a hundred men, and they were spread loosely around

02:52:55.420 --> 02:53:01.180
 him, hidden in the shadows and foliage. Only one thing had he said to them before they

02:53:01.180 --> 02:53:07.700
 had moved into position. "When I go, keep with me."

02:53:07.700 --> 02:53:11.740
 Their task was to attack from the south and sweep up through the camp, spreading

02:53:11.740 --> 02:53:15.740
 as much mayhem and panic along the way as was possible.

02:53:15.740 --> 02:53:18.740
 Makin was unused to leading men.

02:53:18.740 --> 02:53:22.620
 They've enthaled and fighting pits had honed his will to survive, teaching him that above

02:53:22.620 --> 02:53:26.180
 all else you fight for yourself.

02:53:26.180 --> 02:53:31.300
 But that is what Lycus wanted, to break me, to strip away my loyalties to make me less

02:53:31.300 --> 02:53:35.820
 than human. I will not be that man again."

02:53:35.820 --> 02:53:40.340
 The main attack was to be led by Crellus, his first objective to clear the new road of

02:53:40.340 --> 02:53:45.180
 all resistance. He was there that their scouts had reported most of Gundles' warband were

02:53:45.180 --> 02:53:47.380
 to be found.

02:53:47.380 --> 02:53:52.180
 Once the road was clear, Crellus was to assault the camp, which was the signal for the

02:53:52.180 --> 02:53:53.180
 others.

02:53:53.180 --> 02:53:58.340
 Makin and Albin were leading smaller groups hidden to the west and south of the camp.

02:53:58.340 --> 02:54:03.220
 The plan was to meet Crellus and his force at the command tent, situated on a hill

02:54:03.220 --> 02:54:05.340
 close to the camp centre.

02:54:05.340 --> 02:54:10.980
 At the thought of it, begins our eyes drifted to the tent on the mound.

02:54:10.980 --> 02:54:14.620
 Men were appearing from its entrance, standing and staring at the commotion that Crellus

02:54:14.620 --> 02:54:15.620
 was causing.

02:54:15.620 --> 02:54:19.500
 Gundles. It must be.

02:54:19.500 --> 02:54:26.300
 Two other men emerged from the tent, hanging back from the rest. One of them seemed familiar

02:54:26.300 --> 02:54:30.660
 in the way he walked, his posture, a confidence.

02:54:30.660 --> 02:54:35.100
 Then dark cloth figures were appearing from around the hill, drawing tight about those who

02:54:35.100 --> 02:54:40.540
 were to merge from the tent. Even from this distance, there was something clearly different

02:54:40.540 --> 02:54:42.580
 about them.

02:54:42.580 --> 02:54:49.940
 Kalashim. Dammit. We're outnumbered as it is without those hells spawned to complicate things.

02:54:49.940 --> 02:54:55.940
 He shrugged it himself, knew they were committed now and there was no turning back.

02:54:55.940 --> 02:55:00.100
 And this whole attack was my idea, so I'd best be getting to that tent and making sure

02:55:00.100 --> 02:55:02.900
 we win this thing.

02:55:02.900 --> 02:55:06.820
 He looked back to the road and saw Crellus' warriors pouring down the embankment and

02:55:06.820 --> 02:55:08.500
 into the camp.

02:55:08.500 --> 02:55:10.220
 Good.

02:55:10.220 --> 02:55:14.820
 With a battle cry, Hicks exploded into motion, bursting from the tree-line, drawing a knife

02:55:14.820 --> 02:55:19.860
 in each hand as he sped towards the guard, spread between him and the camp.

02:55:19.860 --> 02:55:23.820
 A few paces behind him, his hundred followed.

02:55:23.820 --> 02:55:27.940
 He heard a distant roar from the west, knew that Albon and his warriors were doing the

02:55:27.940 --> 02:55:29.540
 same.

02:55:29.540 --> 02:55:34.500
 Makim ducked a spear thrust and crashed into the man holding it, one of his knives punching

02:55:34.500 --> 02:55:39.300
 through leather into flesh, ripping it free as his momentum carried him on, leaving the man

02:55:39.300 --> 02:55:42.900
 on his knees, hands clutching at his belly.

02:55:42.900 --> 02:55:47.660
 In moments, the guards along the camp's edge were either dead or fleeing. The sudden

02:55:47.660 --> 02:55:51.540
 onslaught of Makim and his warriors too much for them.

02:55:51.540 --> 02:55:56.660
 Makim gathered his warriors in charge into the camp, kicking at fires, smashing gates open,

02:55:56.660 --> 02:56:01.820
 freeing cattle, hacking and slashing at anyone who got in their way.

02:56:01.820 --> 02:56:06.580
 In heartbeats, flames were licking at tents and smoke was billowing.

02:56:06.580 --> 02:56:12.220
 Stampedeing cattle knocked men flying, the whole world seemed to dissolve into chaos.

02:56:12.220 --> 02:56:16.860
 Makim turned a corner and almost ran into a dozen warriors, the ensuing combat savage

02:56:16.860 --> 02:56:18.060
 and short.

02:56:18.060 --> 02:56:22.700
 Makim's knives finding throats and arteries as he slipped through them like a violent wind,

02:56:22.700 --> 02:56:27.020
 the men following him crashing upon those still standing.

02:56:27.020 --> 02:56:32.140
 He sped through the camp, a knife dripping blood in each hand, leaving a trail of bodies

02:56:32.140 --> 02:56:34.220
 in his wake.

02:56:34.220 --> 02:56:39.180
 As he traveled deeper, any kind of resistance melted away, those he came across ran from

02:56:39.180 --> 02:56:41.940
 him and he was happy to let them go.

02:56:41.940 --> 02:56:48.500
 For the most part, they were not gungal's warriors, but merchants, smiths, tanners, cobblers,

02:56:48.500 --> 02:56:55.380
 whores and bands, and maybe a killer, but I'll not slay the innocent.

02:56:55.380 --> 02:57:00.820
 Soon, the initial red mist of battle began to fade, and he glanced behind, saw the black

02:57:00.820 --> 02:57:04.700
 and silver of Ripper's warriors following him.

02:57:04.700 --> 02:57:09.820
 Not used to leading men these days all being in a fight this big, mustn't forget they're

02:57:09.820 --> 02:57:13.620
 with me, mustn't forget the plan.

02:57:13.620 --> 02:57:19.020
 Pulsing, he gave his men a chance to gather behind him as he tried to get his bearings.

02:57:19.020 --> 02:57:24.420
 Screams and the concussive clash of iron drifted down from the north.

02:57:24.420 --> 02:57:25.420
 Crellis sounds closer.

02:57:25.420 --> 02:57:28.060
 Let's get to that command tent.

02:57:28.060 --> 02:57:33.140
 Gondol must die for this to succeed, and to do that, we must carve away through his

02:57:33.140 --> 02:57:35.620
 kadoshim.

02:57:35.620 --> 02:57:40.260
 He reached up to his shoulder and felt the hilt of a short sword, one of the pairs strapped

02:57:40.260 --> 02:57:42.380
 across his back.

02:57:42.380 --> 02:57:47.820
 He'd preferred using his knives, but taking heads from kadoshim was swordwork.

02:57:47.820 --> 02:57:49.900
 He set off again.

02:57:49.900 --> 02:57:54.460
 Close packed tent suddenly gave way to an open space, Cookfire spread about it, tents

02:57:54.460 --> 02:57:57.140
 forming a loose circle.

02:57:57.140 --> 02:57:59.260
 Weapons racks were rolled along one edge.

02:57:59.260 --> 02:58:05.300
 A mass of men were pulling spears from stands, strapping on helms, hefting shields.

02:58:05.300 --> 02:58:10.100
 Meking skidded to a halt, realising what he had stumbled upon.

02:58:10.100 --> 02:58:13.780
 A barracks for the warriors of this warband.

02:58:13.780 --> 02:58:16.660
 With a snail, he ran at them.

02:58:16.660 --> 02:58:21.020
 He hit a knot of men before they had any time to react, his knives tracing a red ruin

02:58:21.020 --> 02:58:23.260
 across their bodies.

02:58:23.260 --> 02:58:28.060
 In moments, he was through them and hurling himself at a new wall of men.

02:58:28.060 --> 02:58:31.180
 Weapons trusted him, but the battle rage was upon him.

02:58:31.180 --> 02:58:35.620
 The world seeming to slow, and he twisted and flowed around every blow aimed at him,

02:58:35.620 --> 02:58:40.780
 his knives licking out to slice throats, puncture groins, cut hamstrings.

02:58:40.780 --> 02:58:47.700
 Dimley, he heard the clash of arms behind him, knew his men were following.

02:58:47.700 --> 02:58:54.860
 Faces appeared before him grim, fearful, shocked, all fell to his twin blades.

02:58:54.860 --> 02:58:57.140
 His progress slowed.

02:58:57.140 --> 02:59:02.540
 The men crammed together now, his ability to move and sway hindered by a crush of bodies.

02:59:02.540 --> 02:59:08.020
 A quick glance showed his men behind him, fighting furiously, but they were outnumbered and

02:59:08.020 --> 02:59:10.820
 the enemy was beginning to curl around their flanks.

02:59:10.820 --> 02:59:16.860
 Surprise and savagery had taken them so far, but had not broken their foe.

02:59:16.860 --> 02:59:19.180
 Things are about to get messy.

02:59:19.180 --> 02:59:23.740
 Meking stepped to the right, deflected a thrust aimed at the ribs of one of his men,

02:59:23.740 --> 02:59:28.260
 slashed across the face of the attacker, kicked another in the knee, saw him buckle and stepped

02:59:28.260 --> 02:59:31.260
 close to cut his throat.

02:59:31.260 --> 02:59:36.900
 There was a great crash, and a concussion that undulated through the hard-pressed warriors.

02:59:36.900 --> 02:59:40.540
 Someone else joining this party.

02:59:40.540 --> 02:59:46.460
 Meking glimpsed a giant figure, Alcyon, wielding two Woodman's axes, as Meking was

02:59:46.460 --> 02:59:52.100
 using his knives, carving away through the enemy like a sigh that harvest time.

02:59:52.100 --> 02:59:56.740
 Heads and limbs flew through the air in great gouts of blood.

02:59:56.740 --> 02:59:58.500
 Albin's crew.

02:59:58.500 --> 03:00:03.940
 Meking grinned, and leapt at his enemy, new strength powering his muscles.

03:00:03.940 --> 03:00:07.620
 Within moments Gungal's warriors were wavering, a ripple of doubt and fear spreading

03:00:07.620 --> 03:00:10.860
 through them, and then they were fleeing.

03:00:10.860 --> 03:00:14.900
 Meking buried a knife in a back, ripped it free, and stood over the collapsing figure,

03:00:14.900 --> 03:00:17.980
 Gore covered, and breathing heavily.

03:00:17.980 --> 03:00:22.900
 He saw Alcyon decapitate one more fleeing warrior, his wife, Rayna, and their son, Tane,

03:00:22.900 --> 03:00:26.620
 either side of him, Albin's warriors spread about them.

03:00:26.620 --> 03:00:33.020
 And well met, a voice said, and Meking turned to see Albin striding towards him.

03:00:33.020 --> 03:00:37.140
 The old man was pale, and had blood seeping from the bandage around his shoulder.

03:00:37.140 --> 03:00:40.620
 I told him to stay at our camp.

03:00:40.620 --> 03:00:43.820
 He had been better off there, and I'd have been happier knowing someone of his skill

03:00:43.820 --> 03:00:46.460
 was guarding fiddily.

03:00:46.460 --> 03:00:50.860
 He felt away the fear for her as he did every time that he was parted from her, but this

03:00:50.860 --> 03:00:51.860
 was war.

03:00:51.860 --> 03:00:56.460
 They both knew that she could not be here in the midst of this.

03:00:56.460 --> 03:01:02.740
 Almette, Meking replied, "Sheathing a knife and gripping the old man's arm."

03:01:02.740 --> 03:01:09.100
 He left blood-stained fingerprints, "Think you might have just saved my skin."

03:01:09.100 --> 03:01:13.460
 Albin looked around at the body's piled about Meking and threw out the barrack ground.

03:01:13.460 --> 03:01:16.900
 "I doubt that," he said.

03:01:16.900 --> 03:01:20.860
 He glanced up through the rolling smoke at the hill that loomed not far away.

03:01:20.860 --> 03:01:23.300
 "Gundle," Meking said.

03:01:23.300 --> 03:01:26.660
 "I, let's go and find him."

03:01:26.660 --> 03:01:28.860
 Both of their war bands were about them now.

03:01:28.860 --> 03:01:32.660
 "There's Khadashim on that hill," Meking said loudly.

03:01:32.660 --> 03:01:37.060
 "They don't die easily, remember, you must take their heads."

03:01:37.060 --> 03:01:40.420
 Albin and others nodded grimly.

03:01:40.420 --> 03:01:45.500
 Meking grinned at them, then ran for the hill.

03:01:45.500 --> 03:01:49.900
 Clouds of smoke billowed about him, parted for a moment, and he saw the hill, the huge

03:01:49.900 --> 03:01:55.540
 and gordy tent upon it, strangely out of place in the somber gloom of fawn.

03:01:55.540 --> 03:01:57.180
 Meking ran faster.

03:01:57.180 --> 03:02:02.380
 The camp, a place of flame and shadow, the thud of his comrades, feet behind him, screams

03:02:02.380 --> 03:02:05.540
 and battle cries swirling on the edying smoke.

03:02:05.540 --> 03:02:09.220
 Then the ground began to rise, and he burst from the haze and tents.

03:02:09.220 --> 03:02:14.340
 Albin, Alcyon, and their men only a few paces behind him.

03:02:14.340 --> 03:02:18.420
 Men were still on the hill, but they were retreating, at least three score of the Khadashim

03:02:18.420 --> 03:02:22.540
 that encircled them were herding them north-east towards the newest part of the road.

03:02:22.540 --> 03:02:28.380
 They're fleeing, running for Jassel, and further along the road there'll be more reinforcements

03:02:28.380 --> 03:02:31.940
 can't let them reach that road.

03:02:31.940 --> 03:02:37.580
 Meking sheathed his knives and drew the two short swords as he ran.

03:02:37.580 --> 03:02:40.620
 The space between them narrowed quickly.

03:02:40.620 --> 03:02:45.100
 Meking and those with him were silent, no battle cries, only the drum of their feet and

03:02:45.100 --> 03:02:48.700
 a jangle and creek of male and leather.

03:02:48.700 --> 03:02:54.260
 Now properly, gondle and Khadashim were aware of them, gondle yelling orders.

03:02:54.260 --> 03:02:58.500
 A score of the Khadashim peeled away from the group, curved swords being drawn from behind

03:02:58.500 --> 03:03:00.700
 their backs.

03:03:00.700 --> 03:03:08.380
 One fixed its black eyes on Meking and ran at him, a dark grin splitting its pallid face.

03:03:08.380 --> 03:03:12.180
 Meking felt a fist of fear squirming his belly, remembering their ferocity and other

03:03:12.180 --> 03:03:15.660
 worldliness when he'd encountered them previously.

03:03:15.660 --> 03:03:19.740
 He growled in anger at his own fear and ran faster.

03:03:19.740 --> 03:03:24.660
 The first Khadashim almost took his head, its sword whistling her fingers with above him as

03:03:24.660 --> 03:03:29.700
 he threw himself into a roll, coming to his feet behind the creature, his own strike at its

03:03:29.700 --> 03:03:34.300
 neck blocked with blinding speed, his second blade slicing through the back of its leg

03:03:34.300 --> 03:03:37.100
 as it spun to face him.

03:03:37.100 --> 03:03:38.620
 Meking leapt away.

03:03:38.620 --> 03:03:42.980
 The creature stumbling as he tried to follow, its hamstrings cut.

03:03:42.980 --> 03:03:47.940
 Even so, it was unnaturally fast, lurching after him.

03:03:47.940 --> 03:03:52.780
 It should be on the ground, not still trying to gut me.

03:03:52.780 --> 03:03:57.660
 All around him, his warriors were locked in combat with the Khadashim, battle cries and

03:03:57.660 --> 03:03:59.740
 death screams rang out.

03:03:59.740 --> 03:04:05.500
 He glimpsed albin take a head, saw that terrible black vapor fill the air.

03:04:05.500 --> 03:04:09.620
 His distraction nearly cosmic in his life as his attacker launched a combination of two-handed

03:04:09.620 --> 03:04:11.300
 blows at him.

03:04:11.300 --> 03:04:17.500
 He parried two and slipped inside the third, instantively punching a shortsword into its belly.

03:04:17.500 --> 03:04:23.300
 The Khadashim's mouth gaped wide, foul breath washing over him as his teeth snapped, trying

03:04:23.300 --> 03:04:25.420
 to fasten on his throat.

03:04:25.420 --> 03:04:30.180
 He headbutted it, pushed away, leaving one sword in its belly, his other blade whistling

03:04:30.180 --> 03:04:35.380
 around to crunch into its collarbone, blood and bone spraying as he wrenched it free and

03:04:35.380 --> 03:04:40.180
 hacked again, this time cutting deep into the creature's neck.

03:04:40.180 --> 03:04:45.420
 He darted in, swerving away from its curved sword, chopping at its neck to finish the

03:04:45.420 --> 03:04:47.140
 job.

03:04:47.140 --> 03:04:51.220
 Somehow the Khadashim's hand snaked out and caught his blade in its fist.

03:04:51.220 --> 03:04:56.100
 A finger flew through the air but still, it held on, as it tried to bring its own sword

03:04:56.100 --> 03:04:58.460
 round to bear.

03:04:58.460 --> 03:05:02.460
 The king grabbed its sword wrist, and for a few heartbeats, they lurched together in an

03:05:02.460 --> 03:05:04.740
 ungainly dance.

03:05:04.740 --> 03:05:08.760
 Within seconds became new, he could not win a contest of strength, the Khadashim's grip was

03:05:08.760 --> 03:05:10.900
 unnaturally strong.

03:05:10.900 --> 03:05:16.100
 Then, in the blink of an eye, its head was spinning through the air and Albin's face appeared

03:05:16.100 --> 03:05:17.980
 before him.

03:05:17.980 --> 03:05:23.140
 The Khadashim's body slumped, fist still gripped around my kin's sword blade, oily black

03:05:23.140 --> 03:05:27.060
 smoke pouring from the open wound of its neck.

03:05:27.060 --> 03:05:32.940
 A winged creature formed in the air above him and screamed wordless hatred at him, then

03:05:32.940 --> 03:05:36.500
 the wind caught it, and it was gone.

03:05:36.500 --> 03:05:40.540
 Making sagged, Albin's hand reaching out to steady him.

03:05:40.540 --> 03:05:46.260
 "There's no getting used to that," McKean breathed, as he yanked his swords free of

03:05:46.260 --> 03:05:49.060
 the creature's corpse.

03:05:49.060 --> 03:05:54.500
 He looked around, saw more of the demon forms appearing in the air above them and then evaporating.

03:05:54.500 --> 03:06:00.920
 At a glance, it seemed that most of those Khadashim that had attacked them had fallen,

03:06:00.920 --> 03:06:06.020
 though many of McKean's and Albin's men were lying still and silent upon the ground.

03:06:06.020 --> 03:06:12.620
 As McKean watched, Alsion, Rayna, and Tane dispatched the last Khadashim.

03:06:12.620 --> 03:06:15.700
 "Gandal," McKean breathed.

03:06:15.700 --> 03:06:20.740
 "Down there," Albin gestured.

03:06:20.740 --> 03:06:25.160
 McKean saw the King of Khanna Tane disappearing amongst the tents, far more Khadashim still

03:06:25.160 --> 03:06:28.200
 about him than McKean had hoped to see.

03:06:28.200 --> 03:06:30.340
 Two men were moving with them.

03:06:30.340 --> 03:06:34.500
 One of them paused as the others disappeared from view and looked back for a moment McKean's

03:06:34.500 --> 03:06:36.540
 eyes locked with him.

03:06:36.540 --> 03:06:40.260
 He staggered, felt as if he'd just been punched in the gut.

03:06:40.260 --> 03:06:46.940
 "It cannot be," McKean's heart was suddenly pounding in his chest, a wave of shock spilling

03:06:46.940 --> 03:06:48.740
 into fury.

03:06:48.740 --> 03:06:53.740
 "Jale,"

03:06:53.740 --> 03:06:55.740
 Chapter 12

03:06:55.740 --> 03:06:58.740
 Jale

03:06:58.740 --> 03:07:02.660
 Jale stood and stared at the warriors on the hill.

03:07:02.660 --> 03:07:08.460
 One man had emerged ahead of the others, blood soaked, and battle grim, a shortsword in each

03:07:08.460 --> 03:07:10.260
 hand.

03:07:10.260 --> 03:07:14.660
 He was staring back at Jale, and although they were a good hundred paces apart, Jale

03:07:14.660 --> 03:07:19.140
 was certain he saw a hatred twist the man's features.

03:07:19.140 --> 03:07:22.780
 There is something familiar about him.

03:07:22.780 --> 03:07:26.900
 "My lord," Dag said, "putting at his sleeve.

03:07:26.900 --> 03:07:29.580
 We must keep moving."

03:07:29.580 --> 03:07:33.420
 They were following the Jihad that was shepherding Gandal, and his retinue of lackeys

03:07:33.420 --> 03:07:38.420
 to safety, hoping that the Jihad would guard Jale and Dag as well as the others as they

03:07:38.420 --> 03:07:41.300
 passed through the camp.

03:07:41.300 --> 03:07:45.340
 Jale had heard the sounds of battle from the hilltop and paused to watch the bloody work

03:07:45.340 --> 03:07:49.500
 of the handful of Jihad warriors that had remained behind.

03:07:49.500 --> 03:07:55.480
 They had fallen, but then it was a score against close to two hundred, and even so the

03:07:55.480 --> 03:07:59.020
 Jihad had decimated their enemy.

03:07:59.020 --> 03:08:05.220
 As Jale stared, he saw the man burst into motion running hard towards him screaming Jale's

03:08:05.220 --> 03:08:06.220
 name.

03:08:06.220 --> 03:08:08.260
 "He knows me."

03:08:08.260 --> 03:08:09.660
 Jale took an involuntary step back.

03:08:10.660 --> 03:08:12.660
 "It doesn't seem to like me much, though."

03:08:12.660 --> 03:08:13.660
 "Who?"

03:08:13.660 --> 03:08:15.660
 Then he knew.

03:08:15.660 --> 03:08:16.860
 "My King."

03:08:16.860 --> 03:08:21.900
 He had changed almost beyond all recognition, slimmer than Jale remembered him.

03:08:21.900 --> 03:08:28.460
 His body chiseled, arms and legs a striated mass of muscle, face a place of ridges, scars

03:08:28.460 --> 03:08:31.900
 and hate-filled eyes.

03:08:31.900 --> 03:08:34.300
 How is he here?

03:08:34.300 --> 03:08:38.500
 He should be dead, or at least a thousand leagues from here, and in shackles.

03:08:39.500 --> 03:08:44.420
 Jale remembered the last time he had seen Makin on the bridge at Dunkelon, chained and

03:08:44.420 --> 03:08:49.220
 being dragged away by Lycos to a Vinfallen slave ship.

03:08:49.220 --> 03:08:54.900
 The fool had challenged me to the court of swords, insulted me in front of my men.

03:08:54.900 --> 03:09:00.340
 From the look on Makin's face, that court of swords was still high on his agenda.

03:09:00.340 --> 03:09:02.180
 Jale gulped.

03:09:02.180 --> 03:09:06.180
 If Makin's expression did not convince him that he was time to go, the warriors charging

03:09:06.180 --> 03:09:09.220
 down the hill behind Makin did.

03:09:09.220 --> 03:09:12.260
 There were giants amongst him.

03:09:12.260 --> 03:09:17.220
 This way, Dagg snapped at him as they entered a maze of tents.

03:09:17.220 --> 03:09:22.020
 Banks of thick smoke rolling through it, the shouts and screams of battle drifting and swirling

03:09:22.020 --> 03:09:23.980
 all about them.

03:09:23.980 --> 03:09:27.620
 Footsteps drummed on the turf of the hill some way behind him, and the G-hower were nowhere

03:09:27.620 --> 03:09:29.340
 to be seen.

03:09:29.340 --> 03:09:31.940
 Panic clenched a fist in his gut.

03:09:31.940 --> 03:09:33.900
 "Jale!"

03:09:33.900 --> 03:09:36.020
 A voice scream behind him.

03:09:36.020 --> 03:09:38.220
 Keep running.

03:09:38.220 --> 03:09:44.260
 Then he saw Dagg, the huntsman moving fast, head, dipped, scanning the ground.

03:09:44.260 --> 03:09:49.300
 Jale followed him around a tent, ran down an empty aisle of churned mud and barrels piled

03:09:49.300 --> 03:09:55.140
 high, then turned again and saw the dark figures of the G-hower hurrying ahead of them.

03:09:55.140 --> 03:09:58.900
 Relief swept him, and he picked up his pace, he and Dagg steadily catching up with

03:09:58.900 --> 03:10:01.900
 Dunkelon, his protectors.

03:10:01.900 --> 03:10:06.300
 They were close to the G-hower now, only a score of paces separating them.

03:10:06.300 --> 03:10:10.100
 A final burst of speed, and Jale was at their heels.

03:10:10.100 --> 03:10:13.300
 He tried to shoulder his way between two of them and entered their protective circle,

03:10:13.300 --> 03:10:16.900
 but one turned and fixed him with its black, dead eyes.

03:10:16.900 --> 03:10:19.900
 "Let me through," Jale gasped.

03:10:19.900 --> 03:10:24.340
 "I am, Jale, king of Isold here, you must protect me!"

03:10:24.340 --> 03:10:30.220
 The G-hower warrior cocked its head at him, then it pushed Jale back, sending him stumbling.

03:10:30.220 --> 03:10:34.620
 Jale reached out and steadied him, shouldn't have left my men on the roadside, and

03:10:34.620 --> 03:10:38.740
 neither, my men!"

03:10:38.740 --> 03:10:40.380
 Jale breathed to Dagg.

03:10:40.380 --> 03:10:46.420
 "Thinkless lie to go on that way," Dagg said, "safe for the travel with them."

03:10:46.420 --> 03:10:49.540
 "I," Jale muttered.

03:10:49.540 --> 03:10:54.580
 He saw Dagg surreptitiously glance down corridor was made by rows of tents.

03:10:54.580 --> 03:10:59.820
 He looks as if he's thinking of slinking off, but probably do the same if I was him.

03:10:59.820 --> 03:11:03.220
 "Gold," Jale hacked out of his burning lungs.

03:11:03.220 --> 03:11:05.180
 "I need this man."

03:11:05.180 --> 03:11:06.420
 "What?"

03:11:06.420 --> 03:11:13.900
 "Gold, for you, when you get me to me kill, more than you can carry, more than you've ever dreamed of."

03:11:13.900 --> 03:11:17.660
 "I've dreamed of a lot of gold in my time," Dagg said.

03:11:17.660 --> 03:11:20.540
 "You've earned it," Jale breathed.

03:11:20.540 --> 03:11:23.980
 "Rickin' I have," Dagg muttered.

03:11:23.980 --> 03:11:27.020
 "A greedy smile crept across his face.

03:11:27.020 --> 03:11:31.740
 I'll get you to make you, the huntsman said."

03:11:31.740 --> 03:11:34.340
 The sounds of battle suddenly grew louder.

03:11:34.340 --> 03:11:39.140
 A knot of enemy warriors clothed in black and silver appeared ahead of them.

03:11:39.140 --> 03:11:41.820
 They looked like nefarious colours.

03:11:41.820 --> 03:11:45.740
 Jale drew his sword as a warrior lurched before him.

03:11:45.740 --> 03:11:50.180
 One of Gundell's men, his sword wildly parrying a flurry of blows from a warrior in black

03:11:50.180 --> 03:11:52.140
 and silver.

03:11:52.140 --> 03:11:56.700
 Jale stabbed his sword into the attacker's side, ripping his sword free, he pushed the

03:11:56.700 --> 03:12:01.100
 dying man away and leapt over him, eyes searching for Dagg, his heart pounding desperately

03:12:01.100 --> 03:12:02.980
 when he could not see him.

03:12:02.980 --> 03:12:06.540
 This way, Dagg called to him.

03:12:06.540 --> 03:12:09.180
 Something slammed into Jale's back.

03:12:09.180 --> 03:12:13.300
 He flew through the air, weightless for a moment, then hit the ground, air crushed from

03:12:13.300 --> 03:12:17.300
 his lungs, and he was sliding in the mud rolling.

03:12:17.300 --> 03:12:21.580
 He came to a stop and rose to one knee, trying to ignore the pain in his chest and shoulder,

03:12:21.580 --> 03:12:25.740
 hand grasping for his sword-hilt, looking back to see a lunatic covered in blood rising

03:12:25.740 --> 03:12:27.260
 from the ground.

03:12:27.260 --> 03:12:28.420
 McKeene

03:12:28.420 --> 03:12:32.740
 "Run!" Jale's mind screamed at him, but he knew he would not make it.

03:12:32.740 --> 03:12:35.540
 McKeene was too close for him to make a safe escape.

03:12:35.540 --> 03:12:38.820
 Jale rose to his feet and he emptied his sword.

03:12:38.820 --> 03:12:41.780
 "I am the finest sword in Isalt here.

03:12:41.780 --> 03:12:46.420
 I slew Castell in single combat and he was a great swordsman in his prime, not old

03:12:46.420 --> 03:12:50.100
 and half mad like this man before me."

03:12:50.100 --> 03:12:53.740
 He set his feet and raised his blade.

03:12:53.740 --> 03:12:55.820
 The world around him faded.

03:12:55.820 --> 03:13:00.740
 The battle raging only a handful of strides away dimmed as a cold focus settled upon him

03:13:00.740 --> 03:13:03.380
 as it always did when he committed to the blade.

03:13:03.380 --> 03:13:09.140
 "Come!" he shouted, "and I'll send you to meet Castell!"

03:13:09.140 --> 03:13:15.700
 He thought to anger McKeene, unbalance him with rage as angry men make mistakes.

03:13:15.700 --> 03:13:19.140
 By the look of McKeene's face his tactic worked.

03:13:19.140 --> 03:13:24.900
 The man gripped his second blade and launched himself forwards, face twisted and snarl.

03:13:24.900 --> 03:13:27.140
 He's moving too fast.

03:13:27.140 --> 03:13:31.180
 The smile twitched at Jale's lips as he stepped forwards to meet McKeene lunging as he did

03:13:31.180 --> 03:13:34.980
 so his saw tip aimed straight at McKeene's heart.

03:13:34.980 --> 03:13:37.220
 His own speed will impale him the idiot.

03:13:37.220 --> 03:13:39.940
 He's a dead man.

03:13:39.940 --> 03:13:46.500
 But then Jale was stabbing into empty air, McKeene no longer where he was supposed to be.

03:13:46.500 --> 03:13:51.860
 The blow slammed into Jale's side, crunching into his ribs, wiped paying, exploding in

03:13:51.860 --> 03:13:54.860
 his chest as he dropped to one knee.

03:13:54.860 --> 03:13:58.100
 The sudden urge to vomit almost consumed him.

03:13:58.100 --> 03:13:59.940
 He's broken my ribs.

03:13:59.940 --> 03:14:01.500
 He reloaded in shock.

03:14:01.500 --> 03:14:06.180
 His hand probing at his side, all the chainmail links bent and broken.

03:14:06.180 --> 03:14:08.740
 Move or die.

03:14:08.740 --> 03:14:13.580
 Jale heaved himself to his feet, raised his sword and pivoted on his heel, but the expected

03:14:13.580 --> 03:14:15.620
 blow never came at him.

03:14:15.620 --> 03:14:19.380
 His dead, McKeene was standing a few paces away, just staring at him.

03:14:19.380 --> 03:14:24.620
 "I've waited a long time for this," McKeene said.

03:14:24.620 --> 03:14:30.980
 His voice has cold and hard as frosted iron, "healing you quicks to good for you."

03:14:30.980 --> 03:14:36.620
 A seed of fear blossomed in Jale's chest, the utter confidence in McKeene's eyes chilling

03:14:36.620 --> 03:14:37.620
 him.

03:14:37.620 --> 03:14:39.540
 "Don't be a fool.

03:14:39.540 --> 03:14:41.580
 I've watched him train on the weapons court.

03:14:41.580 --> 03:14:46.660
 I know his strengths, his weaknesses, his old, slow.

03:14:46.660 --> 03:14:49.460
 I know I can beat him."

03:14:49.460 --> 03:14:55.260
 Castell said something similar, just before I bled him like a sow.

03:14:55.260 --> 03:15:00.220
 Jale said, trying to keep the pain of his splintered ribs out of his voice.

03:15:00.220 --> 03:15:03.460
 McKeene came at him, slowly, this time.

03:15:03.460 --> 03:15:08.020
 Jale noticed knife hilt protruding from half a dozen places on McKeene, to on his belt,

03:15:08.020 --> 03:15:12.500
 a shoulder strap, a hilt poking from a boot.

03:15:12.500 --> 03:15:15.980
 One of McKeene's short-sores trailed a lazy circle as the battle scarred warrior rolled

03:15:15.980 --> 03:15:21.660
 a wrist, then almost faster than Jale could follow McKeene was striking at him.

03:15:21.660 --> 03:15:26.940
 Jale staggered backwards, pain from his ribs exploding with every breath and step as he blocked

03:15:26.940 --> 03:15:31.380
 McKeene's blows each parry more ragged than the last.

03:15:31.380 --> 03:15:35.820
 He's as fast as the Geeha, as impossible, what happened to him?

03:15:35.820 --> 03:15:40.460
 Anick threatened Jale now, as a line of white fire ignited long one thigh when McKeene

03:15:40.460 --> 03:15:45.300
 cut him, moving too fast for him to defend against another wound appearing on his forearm,

03:15:45.300 --> 03:15:49.820
 a slash across his forehead, sending him tumbling backwards as blood sheated into his

03:15:49.820 --> 03:15:51.300
 eyes.

03:15:51.300 --> 03:15:55.500
 Jale lay on his back, an arm wiping the blood from his eyes.

03:15:55.500 --> 03:16:00.620
 Looking up, he saw great sky veiled by the trees of fawn and then McKeene appeared,

03:16:00.620 --> 03:16:02.420
 looming over him.

03:16:02.420 --> 03:16:07.740
 His face was latticed with scars, one ear mostly gone, just a lump of flesh remaining,

03:16:07.740 --> 03:16:10.820
 his hair more gray than black.

03:16:10.820 --> 03:16:15.740
 Jale searched the ground for the hilt of his sword, felt its worn leather and snatched

03:16:15.740 --> 03:16:17.220
 at it.

03:16:17.220 --> 03:16:21.820
 McKeene's boot crunched into his ribs as the old warrior kicked him.

03:16:21.820 --> 03:16:26.060
 Jale screamed, rolled over, vomited bile into the mud.

03:16:26.060 --> 03:16:33.620
 "When you see Castell, be sure and tell him I kept my oath," McKeene said above him.

03:16:33.620 --> 03:16:35.540
 "This can't be happening.

03:16:35.540 --> 03:16:37.340
 He's old!"

03:16:37.340 --> 03:16:41.580
 Jale rolled onto his back, arms raised, wanting to beg for mercy, but he couldn't seem

03:16:41.580 --> 03:16:47.580
 to get his lungs to work properly, only a blubbering wheeze came from his gaping mouth.

03:16:47.580 --> 03:16:53.380
 McKeene raised one of his swords, then there was a crunch, and McKeene was gone.

03:16:53.380 --> 03:16:57.480
 He turned his head and saw McKeene born to the ground grappling with another figure, small

03:16:57.480 --> 03:16:58.480
 and wiry.

03:16:58.480 --> 03:17:02.140
 "Dag, I love that man."

03:17:02.140 --> 03:17:06.820
 Jale climbed to his knees, grabbed his sword, and leaving himself to his feet, a wave of

03:17:06.820 --> 03:17:11.700
 dizziness and nausea, threatening him as his broken ribs complained.

03:17:11.700 --> 03:17:14.100
 All around him, men were fighting.

03:17:14.100 --> 03:17:18.260
 The G-har seemingly reduced to a handful, and more men in black and silver joining the

03:17:18.260 --> 03:17:19.260
 battle.

03:17:19.260 --> 03:17:25.740
 Gandal and his protectors were nowhere to be seen, and need to get out of here.

03:17:25.740 --> 03:17:29.900
 McKeene and Dag were still fighting, McKeene's short swords lying in the mud, a knife

03:17:29.900 --> 03:17:32.780
 glinting in Dag's fist.

03:17:32.780 --> 03:17:37.940
 Jale stumbled towards them, raised his sword, waiting for a clear thrust of McKeene.

03:17:37.940 --> 03:17:42.900
 A new battle cry rose up, this one deep and alien.

03:17:42.900 --> 03:17:46.580
 The giant he had seen in McKeene's company had appeared from out of the smoke and chaos,

03:17:46.580 --> 03:17:52.020
 two more giants behind him, as well as a knot of warriors in black and silver.

03:17:52.020 --> 03:17:57.900
 The first giants saw him, and bellowed, then charged at him, all those behind him following.

03:17:57.900 --> 03:18:03.420
 Jale felt the ground tremble, he glanced down at Dag McKeene, and need McKeene dead,

03:18:03.420 --> 03:18:08.220
 and Dag alive, he is going to get me back to Israel here.

03:18:08.220 --> 03:18:13.460
 Jale looked back up at the unrushing giant, and the swarm of sharp iron behind it.

03:18:13.460 --> 03:18:19.620
 He turned, and ran.

03:18:19.620 --> 03:18:21.380
 CHAPTER 13.

03:18:21.380 --> 03:18:25.300
 Fidale.

03:18:25.300 --> 03:18:28.780
 Fidale paced around the cold ash of the fire pit.

03:18:28.780 --> 03:18:33.780
 In the distance, she could hear the screams of battle in the clash of iron.

03:18:33.780 --> 03:18:38.700
 They say I am queen, that I must do my duty and lead the men of Tenabrow, yet they leave

03:18:38.700 --> 03:18:45.180
 me here with a score of men guarded, like a prisoner, to keep me safe.

03:18:45.180 --> 03:18:47.380
 How is this leading?

03:18:47.380 --> 03:18:51.180
 She mounted a string of curses under her breath, some of the shield men left to guard her

03:18:51.180 --> 03:18:55.820
 glanced at her, a smile twitched the mouth of one.

03:18:55.820 --> 03:18:58.700
 I should not be here.

03:18:58.700 --> 03:19:02.700
 When McKeene had suggested the attack on Gondall's camp, she had known instantly that

03:19:02.700 --> 03:19:07.260
 it was the right thing to do and the thought of doing of attacking instead of running, had

03:19:07.260 --> 03:19:09.780
 its own heady appeal.

03:19:09.780 --> 03:19:15.180
 Fidale had seen the others warm to the idea quickly, and had felt a jolt of pride in McKeene,

03:19:15.180 --> 03:19:17.940
 seeing him listen to by the lords of Ripper.

03:19:17.940 --> 03:19:23.100
 Not that it had surprised her, should recognise something rare in McKeene during their escape

03:19:23.100 --> 03:19:27.860
 through Tenabrow, intelligence and strength, and a lack of ego.

03:19:27.860 --> 03:19:32.340
 He had the ability to look at a situation and know what had to be done, and then to do it

03:19:32.340 --> 03:19:36.540
 with absolute commitment or die in the trying.

03:19:36.540 --> 03:19:41.620
 Nor screams echoed through the forest, the din of battle, ebbing and flowing, and she

03:19:41.620 --> 03:19:43.540
 ground her teeth in frustration.

03:19:43.540 --> 03:19:49.980
 "I will not be a bystander or a leader that does not lead."

03:19:49.980 --> 03:19:54.260
 She brushed the knife-hilt at her belt and strode away from the cold fire pit towards

03:19:54.260 --> 03:20:01.340
 a rack of weapons, gripped a slim shafted spear, and hefted it, testing its weight.

03:20:01.340 --> 03:20:05.660
 For a moment she was back in Tenabrow, in the forest with McKeene, fighting her fear

03:20:05.660 --> 03:20:09.780
 as she plunged a spear into the throats of an enthalen warrior.

03:20:09.780 --> 03:20:13.580
 "My lady," one of the warriors said questioning me.

03:20:13.580 --> 03:20:17.460
 "I am going to the battle," Fida Lays said.

03:20:17.460 --> 03:20:18.460
 "What?"

03:20:18.460 --> 03:20:20.380
 "Is that?

03:20:20.380 --> 03:20:21.380
 Why?"

03:20:21.380 --> 03:20:23.540
 "The warrior blinked."

03:20:23.540 --> 03:20:26.380
 "My lady," he added.

03:20:26.380 --> 03:20:31.620
 "He was not young," by the look of him, he was a veteran of battle, a scar running through

03:20:31.620 --> 03:20:34.420
 the red and silver of his beard.

03:20:34.420 --> 03:20:36.980
 And unused to talking to Queens, it appears.

03:20:36.980 --> 03:20:39.140
 "What is your name?"

03:20:39.140 --> 03:20:40.140
 She asked him.

03:20:40.140 --> 03:20:43.740
 "Aghoste," my lady, he said.

03:20:43.740 --> 03:20:48.020
 "Well, aghoste, I am going to see how the battle fares."

03:20:48.020 --> 03:20:56.660
 "But, album is not my lord and does not command me," Fida Lays finished for him.

03:20:56.660 --> 03:20:59.220
 My people are out there, fighting.

03:20:59.220 --> 03:21:04.380
 My place is with them, I have seen war and dark deeds," she continued louder.

03:21:04.380 --> 03:21:10.780
 I am no stranger to blood, and right now the men of Tenabral are spilling theirs, are not

03:21:10.780 --> 03:21:13.820
 stand hidden and await the outcome.

03:21:13.820 --> 03:21:19.020
 Though we are few in number, we could still be needed at some hard-pressed moment, battles

03:21:19.020 --> 03:21:20.580
 have turned on less.

03:21:20.580 --> 03:21:27.260
 She looked around at their faces, saw the eagerness in their eyes, knew they did not want

03:21:27.260 --> 03:21:32.180
 to be standing guard over her when their shield brothers were dying.

03:21:32.180 --> 03:21:39.220
 After that, she gripped her spear like a staff and marched, resolutely out of the camp.

03:21:39.220 --> 03:21:43.980
 The sound of battle grew steadily louder as they moved through the forest, Aghoste and

03:21:43.980 --> 03:21:48.580
 a few others slipping in front of her, a protective hand.

03:21:48.580 --> 03:21:52.380
 Aghoste paused, held his hand up, and they stopped.

03:21:52.380 --> 03:21:53.380
 "What?"

03:21:53.380 --> 03:21:55.420
 Fida Lays whispered.

03:21:55.420 --> 03:22:00.580
 "Someone's out there," Aghoste said, pointing deeper into the forest away from the

03:22:00.580 --> 03:22:02.820
 sound of battle.

03:22:02.820 --> 03:22:07.860
 He signaled in a handful of men followed him into the trees disappearing into the shadows.

03:22:07.860 --> 03:22:13.980
 For a hundred heartbeats, Fida Lays heard nothing, then, shouting, a clash of iron.

03:22:13.980 --> 03:22:14.980
 Voices.

03:22:14.980 --> 03:22:20.100
 "My lady," Aghoste voiced called, and Fida Lays stepped through the trees the remainder

03:22:20.100 --> 03:22:22.660
 of her guard about her.

03:22:22.660 --> 03:22:27.020
 Aghoste and his warriors stood with three men, all clothed in leather and fur, beards

03:22:27.020 --> 03:22:30.260
 braided and bound with leather.

03:22:30.260 --> 03:22:33.900
 This is hung at their belts, single-bladeed and short-hafted.

03:22:33.900 --> 03:22:37.780
 "There was a hardness about these men that Fida Lays was used to seeing in veterans

03:22:37.780 --> 03:22:38.780
 a battle.

03:22:38.780 --> 03:22:43.020
 "Tell her what you told me," Aghoste said.

03:22:43.020 --> 03:22:48.540
 "We come from Drassel," one said, "sense out in search of allies.

03:22:48.540 --> 03:22:52.940
 Allies for whom," Fida Lays asked, "who do you fight for?"

03:22:52.940 --> 03:22:58.500
 "We fight for Corbin, the bright star," the three men said together.

03:22:58.500 --> 03:23:04.140
 Chapter 14.

03:23:04.140 --> 03:23:05.820
 Makin.

03:23:05.820 --> 03:23:12.900
 Makin rolled in the dirt, grunting as his attacker butted him in the mouth.

03:23:12.900 --> 03:23:17.060
 He spat blood into the man's face butted him back and felt the grip on his wrist

03:23:17.060 --> 03:23:22.820
 loosened, then he was rolling free, pulling a knife from his boot.

03:23:22.820 --> 03:23:25.500
 The man facing him climbed to his feet.

03:23:25.500 --> 03:23:31.820
 He was small, lean with wiry muscle, face a burn-scarred mess.

03:23:31.820 --> 03:23:34.340
 We have much in common.

03:23:34.340 --> 03:23:40.020
 Whatever he promised you, JL's not worth it, Makin growled.

03:23:40.020 --> 03:23:45.300
 "Gold's always worth it," the man snalled back, pulling a knife of his own from a sheath

03:23:45.300 --> 03:23:47.340
 at his back.

03:23:47.340 --> 03:23:53.500
 Makin lunged in their blades clashing, sparking, Makin ducking a hooked punch, pivoting away,

03:23:53.500 --> 03:23:57.780
 back-in close, knife stabbing for his enemy's throat.

03:23:57.780 --> 03:24:00.660
 He was blocked, the man backing away.

03:24:00.660 --> 03:24:06.860
 They parted and circled, Makin crouched and circling like a stalking wolf.

03:24:06.860 --> 03:24:09.260
 A bellowing roar rang out.

03:24:09.260 --> 03:24:11.380
 Makin's eyes were drawn to the battle about them.

03:24:11.380 --> 03:24:15.620
 Alsion was there, hacking with his two woodsman's axes at a kadachim that were standing

03:24:15.620 --> 03:24:17.860
 over another giant figure.

03:24:17.860 --> 03:24:19.860
 Alsion's son?

03:24:19.860 --> 03:24:25.380
 The kadachim's head arked through the air, black mist, hissing from the collapsing corpse.

03:24:25.380 --> 03:24:29.420
 A scuffing of earth drew Makin back to his enemy.

03:24:29.420 --> 03:24:33.180
 He swayed left, avoided a knife in the eye, kicked out.

03:24:33.180 --> 03:24:38.260
 His foot connecting with a knee, heard cartilage crunch, then Makin was in close, plunging

03:24:38.260 --> 03:24:41.260
 his knife into his enemy's belly.

03:24:41.260 --> 03:24:46.020
 He twisted the blade, ripped it free, and shoved the slumping figure away.

03:24:46.020 --> 03:24:52.500
 "Can't take gold where you're going," Makin grunted at the dying man.

03:24:52.500 --> 03:24:56.780
 He didn't answer, eyes were already glazing and vacant.

03:24:56.780 --> 03:24:59.100
 The battle around him was all but done.

03:24:59.100 --> 03:25:03.740
 The kadachim that had fallen back from Gandhul's on a guard all slain, though many men

03:25:03.740 --> 03:25:06.900
 had fallen to their blades.

03:25:06.900 --> 03:25:11.100
 A scattering of Gandhul's other warriors was still fighting against the black and silver

03:25:11.100 --> 03:25:14.980
 of Qalas's men, but they were all but broken.

03:25:14.980 --> 03:25:18.340
 The kadachim stared into the distance, searching for jail.

03:25:18.340 --> 03:25:21.780
 But I know the direction he was running.

03:25:21.780 --> 03:25:25.420
 His eyes lifted over the tents to look towards the road and embankment that cut into

03:25:25.420 --> 03:25:30.900
 form forest, fastest way out of here.

03:25:30.900 --> 03:25:35.100
 Alsion and Rayna were lifting their sun from the ground.

03:25:35.100 --> 03:25:39.540
 Makin approached them, retrieving his short swords as he did so.

03:25:39.540 --> 03:25:43.820
 The giantling was loose-limmed, a cut on his temples swelling, but other than that

03:25:43.820 --> 03:25:45.900
 he looked well enough.

03:25:45.900 --> 03:25:52.540
 He'll live, Makin said, "Then my thanks for following me."

03:25:52.540 --> 03:25:54.780
 The giant shrugged.

03:25:54.780 --> 03:26:01.900
 Rayna has spoken to me of you, of what you did for her and Tane.

03:26:01.900 --> 03:26:04.300
 Makin didn't know what to say about that.

03:26:04.300 --> 03:26:07.380
 He looked beyond the giant's sort of scattering of the warriors he had been put under

03:26:07.380 --> 03:26:11.940
 his command, realized that the sight of jail had driven all else from his mind.

03:26:11.940 --> 03:26:18.980
 Albin?" he asked, "On the hill, waiting for Krelis," the giant said.

03:26:18.980 --> 03:26:25.180
 "I'm here," a voice called, "Krelis, emerging from an aisle between tents."

03:26:25.180 --> 03:26:27.100
 He was blood-soaked and grinning.

03:26:27.100 --> 03:26:32.060
 "Remind me to listen to you next time you say you have a plan," he said to Makin.

03:26:32.060 --> 03:26:36.300
 "The plan's not done until Gungal's dead," Makin said.

03:26:36.300 --> 03:26:40.580
 "I, where is that little snot-nosed assling?"

03:26:40.580 --> 03:26:43.220
 Albin got him trussed up on the hill.

03:26:43.220 --> 03:26:45.460
 "No," Makin grunted.

03:26:45.460 --> 03:26:48.900
 He's fled with a few score catish him about him.

03:26:48.900 --> 03:26:51.700
 That way, he pointed.

03:26:51.700 --> 03:26:56.740
 "Well, what we doing standing here, flapping our jaws, then?"

03:26:56.740 --> 03:26:59.380
 Just what I was thinking.

03:26:59.380 --> 03:27:04.820
 Krelis tugged on his beard, eyes narrowing as he looked the way Gungal had fled.

03:27:04.820 --> 03:27:09.140
 Best go and tell Albin to follow us," Krelis said to Makin.

03:27:09.140 --> 03:27:13.780
 "We'll need all the swords we can muster against those damn catish him."

03:27:13.780 --> 03:27:17.220
 "Send someone else," Makin said as he strode away.

03:27:17.220 --> 03:27:20.100
 "I'm going after Gungal."

03:27:20.100 --> 03:27:24.740
 And jail.

03:27:24.740 --> 03:27:26.820
 Chapter 15.

03:27:26.820 --> 03:27:30.180
 Veridis.

03:27:30.180 --> 03:27:31.460
 Shield wall.

03:27:31.460 --> 03:27:37.620
 Veridis shouted, lifting his borrowed shield and expecting those either side of him to lock him to place.

03:27:37.620 --> 03:27:42.820
 There was a sporadic thudding as shields came up, lacking the control discipline that he was used to.

03:27:42.820 --> 03:27:49.060
 "These men are not my dregs teeth, not veterans of a score of battles in a shield wall."

03:27:49.060 --> 03:27:51.380
 He bit back a curse.

03:27:51.380 --> 03:27:53.060
 "I am lucky they are here at all."

03:27:53.060 --> 03:27:58.580
 When Veridis had spoken of using the shield wall to clear the road, Krelis had

03:27:58.580 --> 03:27:59.780
 curled a lip and disgust.

03:27:59.780 --> 03:28:05.220
 Veridis' brother had never liked the idea of men fighting in such a way to him.

03:28:05.220 --> 03:28:06.100
 It lacked honour.

03:28:07.300 --> 03:28:09.380
 It works, and it will save lives.

03:28:09.380 --> 03:28:14.260
 Even as Veridis had said the words he'd heard and affairs voice echoing them in his mind.

03:28:14.260 --> 03:28:20.900
 "Your task is to keep the road clear and then to hold it," Albin had said,

03:28:20.900 --> 03:28:22.260
 stepping in between the two brothers.

03:28:22.260 --> 03:28:28.180
 "Now how you do it is your decision, Veridis, only guard our backs and stop the reinforcements

03:28:28.180 --> 03:28:30.500
 that will surely come from further along the road."

03:28:30.500 --> 03:28:35.140
 Krelis had said no more, and so the plan had proceeded.

03:28:35.140 --> 03:28:39.380
 Krelis, attacking the road from the north, Albin and McKean spearheading two smaller groups

03:28:39.380 --> 03:28:40.260
 into the camp.

03:28:40.260 --> 03:28:44.900
 Veridis and his reserve group holding the road as Krelis moved onto the main camp,

03:28:44.900 --> 03:28:47.860
 and guarding against the counter attack that would inevitably come.

03:28:47.860 --> 03:28:52.500
 So far, it had all gone remarkably smoothly.

03:28:52.500 --> 03:28:57.300
 The enemy, breaking and scattering, surprised and ferocity, shattering any resistance

03:28:57.300 --> 03:28:58.900
 before it had a chance to form fully.

03:28:58.900 --> 03:29:04.900
 It's amazing what a small and focused force can do against a larger unprepared one.

03:29:04.900 --> 03:29:12.180
 He took a deep breath, knew that battle was close, tried to calm the anger he felt bubbling

03:29:12.180 --> 03:29:13.380
 away inside his chest.

03:29:13.380 --> 03:29:17.460
 That was his overwhelming emotion right now, anger.

03:29:17.460 --> 03:29:22.580
 He was angry with Caledus, for the web of lies and deception he had woven,

03:29:22.580 --> 03:29:26.820
 and for what he had done to an affair, but that was nothing beside the anger he felt

03:29:26.820 --> 03:29:27.620
 for his old friend.

03:29:27.620 --> 03:29:33.780
 "N affair, how could you believe Caledus, why did you not resist or come to me sooner?"

03:29:34.660 --> 03:29:36.420
 We could have stood against Caledus together.

03:29:36.420 --> 03:29:40.740
 And most of all, he was angry with himself.

03:29:40.740 --> 03:29:45.860
 "I am a fool. How did I not see it all happening about me?"

03:29:45.860 --> 03:29:46.980
 And Veridis, the loyal.

03:29:46.980 --> 03:29:51.140
 Veridis, the trust worthy, Veridis, the blind idiot, I say.

03:29:51.140 --> 03:29:55.540
 "Can't be so. Focus, you have a battle to fight."

03:29:55.540 --> 03:30:01.140
 He had gathered his 200 on the embankment to the north east of the camp,

03:30:01.140 --> 03:30:04.340
 at the point where the road left the camp behind and plowed into the forest.

03:30:04.980 --> 03:30:10.260
 "From this vantage point, Veridis had watched Krellus, Alden and Makin,

03:30:10.260 --> 03:30:12.260
 flood through the camp with their small bands of men.

03:30:12.260 --> 03:30:18.340
 Fires and great ploughs of smoke marked their paths as they moved ever deeper,

03:30:18.340 --> 03:30:21.140
 inexorably towards the hill with gunnell's command tent on it.

03:30:21.140 --> 03:30:25.140
 It seemed movement on the hill, what looked like combat,

03:30:25.140 --> 03:30:28.420
 though it was hard to discern any details because of the distance.

03:30:28.420 --> 03:30:33.620
 Now the flames and smoke were so dense that it was hard to see anything at all,

03:30:33.620 --> 03:30:36.500
 but Veridis' attention was needed elsewhere anyway.

03:30:36.500 --> 03:30:41.860
 To his left, in a depths of form, men were approaching along the road.

03:30:41.860 --> 03:30:47.540
 Veridis saw a knot of warriors in male and leather at the front and center of a much larger

03:30:47.540 --> 03:30:52.100
 horde that spilt down the embankments to either side, at least a thousand strong.

03:30:52.100 --> 03:30:56.900
 Finally, the shields either side of Veridis locked into his.

03:30:56.900 --> 03:31:02.900
 He felt the urge to order the march, knew that the shield wall moving towards a larger

03:31:02.900 --> 03:31:07.060
 foe had always caused hesitation and sewn seeds of fear in the enemy,

03:31:07.060 --> 03:31:09.060
 but he was uncertain of the men about him.

03:31:09.060 --> 03:31:13.860
 Just getting into formation on the road and forming the shield wall is seemed to tax them.

03:31:13.860 --> 03:31:16.340
 He glanced at the warrior to his right.

03:31:16.340 --> 03:31:19.140
 A young man, his beard a straggly thing.

03:31:19.140 --> 03:31:23.380
 "Young, I know him. It is Balan."

03:31:23.380 --> 03:31:28.180
 "Here's only a few years younger than I. We used to spar together."

03:31:29.300 --> 03:31:33.380
 But Veridis felt older than his years, knew that his travels and experience in the

03:31:33.380 --> 03:31:35.700
 shield wall set him apart from most of those about him.

03:31:35.700 --> 03:31:40.340
 "I cannot expect too much from them yet. They only know this much because

03:31:40.340 --> 03:31:43.620
 an affair ordered that all men of Tenabral were drilled in the shield wall."

03:31:43.620 --> 03:31:47.300
 "It will have to do," Veridis thought.

03:31:47.300 --> 03:31:51.380
 Marching may be a step too far. We'll wait here for them.

03:31:51.380 --> 03:31:56.340
 We fill the road and block the path to the camp, so they'll have to cut us down and march through

03:31:56.340 --> 03:31:57.460
 us to get at Crowley's flank.

03:31:57.460 --> 03:32:03.140
 Looking at the men around him, Ernest brave men of Thousand Leagues from home,

03:32:03.140 --> 03:32:08.260
 he felt some of his anger drain, replaced with sympathy and a deep sense of responsibility for them.

03:32:08.260 --> 03:32:14.020
 "Ballan, listen to me," Veridis said to the warrior beside him.

03:32:14.020 --> 03:32:17.780
 The man returned his gaze and Veridis saw fear in his eyes.

03:32:17.780 --> 03:32:21.620
 "Follow my orders and we'll come through this."

03:32:21.620 --> 03:32:25.060
 The warrior nodded at him, then looked away.

03:32:26.500 --> 03:32:29.540
 Shouts and challenges grew louder as the enemy came closer.

03:32:29.540 --> 03:32:35.380
 "If they get past us, our kin and sword brothers die," Veridis yelled,

03:32:35.380 --> 03:32:41.220
 feeling the blood begin to surge through his veins fear and excitement merging into the exhilaration

03:32:41.220 --> 03:32:46.580
 that he always felt before battle. "Remember your olds and fight for your sword brother beside you."

03:32:46.580 --> 03:32:50.420
 He felt Balan stand straighter alongside him.

03:32:51.940 --> 03:32:56.260
 They were inexperienced, but to the war band of gundall that was approaching him,

03:32:56.260 --> 03:32:59.060
 the shield walls like nothing they had ever seen before.

03:32:59.060 --> 03:33:06.500
 Veridis saw the front ranks of the enemy slow, close enough now to see looks of confusion and worry

03:33:06.500 --> 03:33:11.460
 upon their faces. "Warriors are a superstitious bunch, always wary of the unknown."

03:33:11.460 --> 03:33:16.340
 "Sods," Veridis shouted, drawing the short blade at his hip.

03:33:16.340 --> 03:33:21.540
 "About and behind him, he heard the hiss of iron leaving leather.

03:33:21.540 --> 03:33:26.980
 "He began to thump his hilt upon the wooden boards of his shield. The rhythmic pounding

03:33:26.980 --> 03:33:32.020
 taken up first by those about him, then spreading, rippling through the deep wall of 200 men."

03:33:32.020 --> 03:33:38.020
 He saw its effects upon those approaching, warriors hesitating in their steps,

03:33:38.020 --> 03:33:39.860
 uncertainty spreading like a mist.

03:33:39.860 --> 03:33:45.940
 Then one warrior stepped from the crowd, a big man clad in mail, a helm of iron,

03:33:45.940 --> 03:33:51.620
 his sword raised high. He bellowed a wordless challenge and ran at Veridis' wall of shields.

03:33:51.620 --> 03:33:56.580
 A trickle of men followed him, warriors from the centre, then others,

03:33:56.580 --> 03:34:01.140
 warriors, woodsman and laborers from the flanks, all screaming blood and murder.

03:34:01.140 --> 03:34:06.980
 "Ready!" Veridis roared, spreading his feet and leaning forward into his shield.

03:34:06.980 --> 03:34:13.220
 A thread of fear clenched in his belly as he always did in this moment when battle was inevitable,

03:34:13.220 --> 03:34:20.340
 but not yet joined. Then men were crashing into his shield, blows raining upon it,

03:34:20.340 --> 03:34:24.580
 shuddering through his wrist and arm into his shoulder, numbing muscle and sinew.

03:34:24.580 --> 03:34:26.340
 And the fear was gone.

03:34:26.340 --> 03:34:30.900
 A face appeared above his shield rim, snarling at him.

03:34:30.900 --> 03:34:36.900
 "Now!" Veridis bellowed, stabbing his short sword through the thin gap between his shield and

03:34:36.900 --> 03:34:44.020
 balance, to either side warriors doing the same. He felt his blade bite into flesh,

03:34:44.020 --> 03:34:50.580
 drew it back red, stabbed again. The face above his shield rim disappeared, replaced by another,

03:34:50.580 --> 03:34:55.380
 he stabbed again, felt his blade turn on mail, drew it back and stabbed lower,

03:34:55.380 --> 03:35:00.660
 heard a scream, kept stabbing, not frantically as balance was doing beside him, but steady,

03:35:00.660 --> 03:35:06.260
 a rhythm to it. "Ease A!" Veridis barked about him, they're not going anywhere.

03:35:06.260 --> 03:35:13.220
 Balance shot to me glance, eyes wide and white, but his blade work became less frantic.

03:35:13.220 --> 03:35:19.700
 Men fell, blood sleucing down Veridis's blade, soaking his hand,

03:35:19.700 --> 03:35:23.540
 muscles burning, the unrelenting thought of blows against his shield, pushing his

03:35:23.540 --> 03:35:29.540
 straining body to its limits. Sinew screamed against the constant pressure as men piled

03:35:29.540 --> 03:35:35.140
 against the shield wall, some throwing themselves, others crushed by the oncoming mass behind them like

03:35:35.140 --> 03:35:41.780
 the sea against a tidal wall. Fingers grabbed at the rim of Veridis' shield, pulling it down,

03:35:41.780 --> 03:35:46.020
 and Veridis saw a woodsman, caught a glimpse of the road and forest behind him.

03:35:46.020 --> 03:35:50.740
 Veridis chopped another scream as fingers flew through the air.

03:35:50.740 --> 03:35:57.460
 The constant pressure was easing, still the thought of weapons as men hammered at the wall,

03:35:57.460 --> 03:35:59.860
 but the unrelenting press of bodies was gone.

03:35:59.860 --> 03:36:06.900
 The end is coming, Veridis recognized, when the initial rush of that first battle theory was spent,

03:36:06.900 --> 03:36:12.420
 and men looked about at the carnage reaped by the shield wall. He had seen it before.

03:36:12.420 --> 03:36:18.260
 New that the ground would be piled with the dead, warrior spirits crushed by the shield

03:36:18.260 --> 03:36:23.380
 walls, faceless brutality. We must strike now and break them.

03:36:24.500 --> 03:36:31.140
 Farwards! Veridis cried. He punched Ballon to his right to get his attention, yelled his command again

03:36:31.140 --> 03:36:37.700
 and took a step forwards. For a moment, he thought he was alone, stepping out of the wall into

03:36:37.700 --> 03:36:42.900
 certain death, but then Ballon followed him. A heart beat later the man on his either side doing

03:36:42.900 --> 03:36:48.260
 the same, and with a stutter the front row of the shield wall took one shambling step forwards.

03:36:48.260 --> 03:36:54.420
 Veridis stumbled on a body underfoot that managed to stay upright, even though the ground was

03:36:54.420 --> 03:37:01.140
 slipped with blood and snared with limbs. He felt the line sway, thought that the wall would

03:37:01.140 --> 03:37:08.740
 splinter, break and be scattered, but then it steadied. Veridis felt the strength and solidity return.

03:37:08.740 --> 03:37:13.860
 He set his feet and stabbed through the gap in the shield's felt his sword,

03:37:13.860 --> 03:37:18.900
 pierce flesh, heard more screams as others did the same. It's working.

03:37:19.700 --> 03:37:24.260
 Farwards! Veridis yelled again, and he did not wait this time to take another step. The

03:37:24.260 --> 03:37:32.420
 shield wall shuttered forwards, swords snaked out, more men falling, dying. March! Veridis shouted,

03:37:32.420 --> 03:37:38.660
 his voice hoarse and dry. Bagging his sword against his shield to set time, he felt the whole

03:37:38.660 --> 03:37:43.540
 shield wall move with him, some of the men behind him, funding their swords against shield in time

03:37:43.540 --> 03:37:49.540
 with him, the front row still stabbing as they marched. They were a ragged mass compared to the

03:37:49.540 --> 03:37:54.420
 disciplined ranks that Veridis was accustomed to leading, but still he grinned with the joy of it as

03:37:54.420 --> 03:38:00.580
 his enemy fell before him, felt as if they were unbeatable, unstoppable, and then the pressure

03:38:00.580 --> 03:38:06.500
 before them was gone. The sound of feet drumming on the road as men turned and ran before them.

03:38:06.500 --> 03:38:13.700
 Veridis called a halt. The wall stumbled to a ragged stop, and Veridis lowered his shield.

03:38:15.460 --> 03:38:22.260
 Body's lays strewn everywhere. Trees loomed before them. The camp ablaze behind.

03:38:22.260 --> 03:38:27.940
 Dim figures could be seen fleeing along the road, some escaping into the gloom of the forest

03:38:27.940 --> 03:38:34.420
 to either side of the road. Not enough to challenge us again. Relief flooded through him.

03:38:34.420 --> 03:38:38.260
 They are broken. With one.

03:38:38.260 --> 03:38:43.780
 They had all known that the greatest threat would come from the warriors and workers who were

03:38:43.780 --> 03:38:49.460
 away from the camp, spread along the road. They were the ones who would be alerted to the attack

03:38:49.460 --> 03:38:54.100
 would be able to gather their courage and attack, unlike all those within the camp who would be caught

03:38:54.100 --> 03:39:02.340
 by surprise. He looked and saw Banan grinning. The recognition of survival, the joy of victory,

03:39:02.340 --> 03:39:08.820
 saw the same expression spreading amongst those about him. Then, voices yelled a warning.

03:39:09.780 --> 03:39:15.620
 Death screens rang out. Veridis spun around, searching for the new danger. It came from behind.

03:39:15.620 --> 03:39:21.380
 Figures were emerging from the camp a solid mass of warriors appearing, dressed in black male,

03:39:21.380 --> 03:39:27.860
 curved swords in their hands. Caddish him. They were running up the embankment,

03:39:27.860 --> 03:39:32.580
 carving into the flank and rear of their edited shield wall, 20, 40, 60 of them,

03:39:32.580 --> 03:39:36.500
 more appearing from amongst the tents as well as a tight knot of others behind them.

03:39:37.620 --> 03:39:45.620
 Gondall and his honor guard. He cannot get away. Veridis began moving towards the Caddish him,

03:39:45.620 --> 03:39:50.420
 even as his mouth opened to shout for the wall to reform, he knew it would not defeat these

03:39:50.420 --> 03:39:56.660
 demons spawn. We have to take their heads and the wall will not help us do that.

03:39:56.660 --> 03:40:03.300
 He saw men crunching shields together, falling back on the strategy that had just served them so well,

03:40:03.300 --> 03:40:08.580
 but a handful of Caddish him leapt at the hastily formed wall, ripped it apart with savage fury,

03:40:08.580 --> 03:40:14.740
 swords rising and falling and deadly arcs. My men are dying, the Caddish him are slaughtering my men.

03:40:14.740 --> 03:40:19.460
 Veridis broke into a run and hurled himself at the Caddish him.

03:40:19.460 --> 03:40:24.340
 Chapter 16

03:40:24.340 --> 03:40:26.180
 J.O

03:40:28.820 --> 03:40:34.020
 J.O ran through the camp with every jarring step, every wheezing breath trying to somehow

03:40:34.020 --> 03:40:38.980
 lessen the pain of his broken ribs. Though that doesn't seem to be working. Blood was still

03:40:38.980 --> 03:40:43.700
 leaking into his eyes from a wound on his forehead and my keen sword cut to on his leg and forearm

03:40:43.700 --> 03:40:49.140
 burned as if he'd been branded. He took me by surprise, before I was ready.

03:40:49.140 --> 03:40:55.220
 He risked a look over his shoulder, relieved to see that there was no lunatic arm to the brim

03:40:55.220 --> 03:41:00.340
 with knives chasing after him. In fact, no one was in sight before or behind.

03:41:00.340 --> 03:41:07.060
 It felt as if he was alone in a world of white tents and narrow isles of smoke and fire

03:41:07.060 --> 03:41:12.900
 and distant screams. The last he'd seen a McKean had been rolling in the dirt with a dog.

03:41:12.900 --> 03:41:17.780
 He looked like a man with a serious grudge and I really could do without that right now.

03:41:17.780 --> 03:41:24.500
 Could be that dog has killed McKean. Much as he wanted to believe it, he wasn't convinced.

03:41:25.220 --> 03:41:28.180
 The ease with which McKean had shattered his ribs at shock jail.

03:41:28.180 --> 03:41:34.580
 How did he move so fast? It must have been a lucky blow, he's old and broken.

03:41:34.580 --> 03:41:40.580
 He heard screaming off to his left and so veered right, taking a new path through a band

03:41:40.580 --> 03:41:44.340
 and tents and quick fires. No more backly if I can help it.

03:41:44.340 --> 03:41:50.820
 Ahead of him, the trees of fawn loomed overlooking the fringes of the camp like a tribe of

03:41:50.820 --> 03:41:56.980
 dower ogres. Nearly out of his hellhole, even if McKean still breathes, he'll never find me now,

03:41:56.980 --> 03:42:04.180
 I just have to find my men. 300 swords waiting for me half a league along Gundles cursed road.

03:42:04.180 --> 03:42:12.580
 McClamour of battle drifted down to jail. He was travelling straight towards it. He didn't turn

03:42:12.580 --> 03:42:18.980
 away this time, though, as it was exactly where he needed to go. My men are out there somewhere,

03:42:18.980 --> 03:42:22.420
 and if I'm going to get out of fawn alive, I will need them about me.

03:42:22.420 --> 03:42:26.260
 So jail gritted his teeth and ran on.

03:42:26.260 --> 03:42:34.100
 He emerged from the tents into a scene of carnage. Warriors were masked upon the road.

03:42:34.100 --> 03:42:38.660
 More of the enemy in the black and silver of Tenabrow, but to jail's pleasant surprise,

03:42:38.660 --> 03:42:44.020
 the Jihad were loose amongst them. The road was a heaving mass of battle,

03:42:44.020 --> 03:42:48.180
 the path into the forest blocked for the moment, but the Jihad were doing all that they could

03:42:48.180 --> 03:42:54.260
 about that. Even as jail watched, he saw one of the Jihad lift a warrior into the air and

03:42:54.260 --> 03:42:59.780
 a hole of him down the embankment. He might be able to sneak through in the chaos, he thought,

03:42:59.780 --> 03:43:06.740
 and began to climb. Then he saw Gundle. The young king of Carnatine was standing upon the road,

03:43:06.740 --> 03:43:10.820
 separate from the battle, his sycophants huddled about him, though their numbers looked somewhat

03:43:10.820 --> 03:43:17.060
 thinned. About them were a dozen or so Jihad warriors, the rest of Gundles on a guard trying to carve

03:43:17.060 --> 03:43:23.220
 away through the wall of flesh and bone that barred the way to escape. From what jail could see,

03:43:23.220 --> 03:43:28.340
 they were doing a good job of it. Stick with Gundle or try and sneak past.

03:43:28.340 --> 03:43:35.460
 A warrior in black and silver flew through the air, a hand span from jail, struck the ground

03:43:35.460 --> 03:43:40.340
 and rolled bonelessly down the embankment, crashing into a tent and bringing it down around him.

03:43:40.340 --> 03:43:46.740
 Jail reached the road and tried to skirt the combat, which had broken down into a series of scattered

03:43:46.740 --> 03:43:52.340
 and brutal skirmishes. The enemy looked to be rallying against the Jihad,

03:43:52.340 --> 03:43:57.860
 one man leading a charge that sent two of those disturbing black mists jettling into the air.

03:43:57.860 --> 03:44:02.820
 Break, dameu. Jail muttered at the enemy, "Don't rally."

03:44:02.820 --> 03:44:09.780
 Jail, a voice called. And for a terrifying moment, jail thought it was Makin.

03:44:09.780 --> 03:44:15.220
 His head jerked around to see Gundle waving wildly to him from the midst of his protectors.

03:44:16.100 --> 03:44:22.260
 Over here, Gundle back into him. For a moment, jail considered his options and quickly concluded

03:44:22.260 --> 03:44:28.900
 that he was safer within a ring of Jihad warriors. He hobbled over to Gundle and Jihad stepping

03:44:28.900 --> 03:44:35.540
 out of the way to let him through. "I'm glad you're still alive," Gundle said. "300 men, you say.

03:44:35.540 --> 03:44:40.660
 Where are they?" For a moment, jail didn't understand what Gundle was talking about.

03:44:40.660 --> 03:44:44.820
 Then he realized he was referring to jail's men left waiting further along the road.

03:44:45.940 --> 03:44:53.060
 Not a complete idiot then. That way, jail pointed over the combat before them into the dark tunnel of the road.

03:44:53.060 --> 03:45:00.020
 "Good. The rassel is that way too, and a few hundred more swords around to me would be a good thing."

03:45:00.020 --> 03:45:06.420
 He looked back at his camp, at the flames and the black clouds of smoke at the dead scattered

03:45:06.420 --> 03:45:12.500
 all around. "Look what they've done," Gundle wailed, faced twisting in misery.

03:45:12.500 --> 03:45:15.220
 "They've destroyed my camp! Crashed my warband!"

03:45:15.220 --> 03:45:20.740
 Most hope they don't do it to you too, you whining little worm, and more importantly not to me.

03:45:20.740 --> 03:45:25.780
 "We need to move," jail muttered, not liking the feeling of standing still.

03:45:25.780 --> 03:45:30.580
 The knowledge that McKeemed was out there somewhere, hunting him,

03:45:30.580 --> 03:45:32.580
 hovered at the back of his mind like a black cloud.

03:45:32.580 --> 03:45:35.940
 "Yes, onwards," Gundle yelled.

03:45:37.540 --> 03:45:42.420
 A Jihad warrior turned its black eyes upon Gundle, then with a shrug began to lead their small

03:45:42.420 --> 03:45:48.180
 group along the road. The other Jihad, a dozen left with Gundle at best,

03:45:48.180 --> 03:45:51.700
 found out in a tight half-circle, pushing into the fringes of battle.

03:45:51.700 --> 03:45:57.140
 Then something crashed into their group from the left, sending men tumbling,

03:45:57.140 --> 03:45:59.700
 Jihad reeling, turning to face this new attack.

03:45:59.700 --> 03:46:05.300
 Jail staggered into one of Gundle's followers, shoving the man to the ground as he righted himself.

03:46:06.500 --> 03:46:09.620
 They'd been attacked by a knot of warriors in black and silver,

03:46:09.620 --> 03:46:13.060
 charged and rammed by them, all with shields raised and interlocked.

03:46:13.060 --> 03:46:17.780
 Even as he looked, short-sword darted out from the small wall of shields.

03:46:17.780 --> 03:46:22.420
 Two of Gundle's followers were caught in the attack and fell, pierced many times.

03:46:22.420 --> 03:46:26.100
 Gundle was shrieking, waving his sword around in effectually.

03:46:26.100 --> 03:46:32.260
 Jail saw blades sink into the flesh of a Jihad, that it shrugged off the blows and grabbed a

03:46:32.260 --> 03:46:37.300
 shield rim, dragging the warrior behind it forwards and chopping into his neck, sending him

03:46:37.300 --> 03:46:39.380
 crashing to the ground in a spray of blood.

03:46:39.380 --> 03:46:46.660
 The small shield wall fractured, men breaking away and attacking Gundle's part of the old way,

03:46:46.660 --> 03:46:50.660
 man to man. Not a wise choice against the Jihad.

03:46:50.660 --> 03:46:56.340
 Jail backed away, put a few of Gundle's followers between him and this new attack.

03:46:57.460 --> 03:46:58.980
 I'm scared of no man, but…

03:46:58.980 --> 03:47:04.660
 He put a hand to his throbbing ribs, glanced down at the blood, crossing his thigh.

03:47:04.660 --> 03:47:11.620
 Another warrior came at the first Jihad, this man in a black and silver commander's quirass,

03:47:11.620 --> 03:47:15.220
 using sword and shield together to push the creature back a place,

03:47:15.220 --> 03:47:19.780
 sword darting out to stab at its thigh, shield boss punching into the Jihad's face.

03:47:19.780 --> 03:47:23.060
 There was something familiar about the warrior.

03:47:24.420 --> 03:47:31.780
 I know him. The Jihad staggered back a few steps, black blood dripping from its broken nose.

03:47:31.780 --> 03:47:38.580
 Its face twisted in a smile as it launched itself forwards, shoulder ramming into the warrior,

03:47:38.580 --> 03:47:41.940
 sending him stumbling backwards, tripping over a corpse and falling hard.

03:47:41.940 --> 03:47:49.060
 The Jihad stood over him, curved sword rising, then another figure was there, plunging a

03:47:49.060 --> 03:47:57.140
 spear into the Jihad's throat, a woman. She was dressed in travelling fur and leather,

03:47:57.140 --> 03:48:03.300
 richly made, dark hair pulled back tight. Then warriors were swarming either side of her,

03:48:03.300 --> 03:48:06.420
 chopping at the wounded Jihad as she wrenched her spear free.

03:48:06.420 --> 03:48:12.660
 The Jihad warrior went down in a hail of blows, his head hacked from its body,

03:48:12.660 --> 03:48:18.420
 that black mist spilling from its neck. A figure formed in the air, black winged and red-eyed,

03:48:18.420 --> 03:48:23.300
 hissing its fury, then it was gone. Only a few ragged wisps remaining.

03:48:23.300 --> 03:48:26.020
 I wished it stopped doing that.

03:48:26.020 --> 03:48:31.700
 Gandhul was screaming orders to attack, though nobody seemed to be paying much attention to him.

03:48:31.700 --> 03:48:37.220
 Most of his hangers on were running in different directions. J.L. saw one of the Jihad

03:48:37.220 --> 03:48:40.980
 grabbed Gandhul by the scruff of his neck and started dragging him through the crowd,

03:48:40.980 --> 03:48:43.860
 three or four Jihad carving away for him through the melee.

03:48:45.460 --> 03:48:49.380
 Gandhul spluttered a protest, but the Jihad just marched, resolutely on.

03:48:49.380 --> 03:48:56.020
 J.L. lurched into motion, saw them as his best way of getting out of this and stumbled close

03:48:56.020 --> 03:49:03.060
 behind them. The huddle of warriors crashed into them, mostly enemy all striking at a Jihad in their

03:49:03.060 --> 03:49:11.620
 midst. With a grimace, J.L. drew his sword and pulled a knife from his belt. Pain over death always

03:49:11.620 --> 03:49:18.580
 the better option. He hacked at a warrior's head, bursts of agony pulsing from his damaged ribs.

03:49:18.580 --> 03:49:25.700
 He dented the man's helm, then slashed at another with his knife, leaving a long red wound.

03:49:25.700 --> 03:49:31.140
 This warrior, lurching away, then they were past them. J.L. adding his blades to the Jihad as they

03:49:31.140 --> 03:49:34.820
 cut, huge, punched and stabbed their way through the battling mass.

03:49:36.740 --> 03:49:42.340
 After his left, J.L. saw the woman steal wielding her spear, a group of warriors typed about her.

03:49:42.340 --> 03:49:50.660
 He had seen her before, at the great council of Aquilus in Geraldine. He blinked, as recognition dawned.

03:49:50.660 --> 03:49:57.860
 Fidelity. Aquilus is wife or widow now. Nafaeh's mother.

03:49:57.860 --> 03:50:02.660
 What is she doing here? And fighting against Nafaeh's ally.

03:50:04.340 --> 03:50:09.540
 He grunted, as he ducked a sword blow aimed at his head, chopped at an ankle, then glanced

03:50:09.540 --> 03:50:15.700
 back to Fidelity. She'd make a good hostage. Either to buy me safe passage out of here or a good

03:50:15.700 --> 03:50:20.260
 trophy to present in a fair, something to win back some favour and prestige from the disastrous

03:50:20.260 --> 03:50:25.700
 mess these campaigners become. They were almost through the main press of battle now.

03:50:25.700 --> 03:50:32.260
 J.L. could see empty road beyond a few clumps of combat, the darkness of form beckoning,

03:50:32.260 --> 03:50:37.060
 promising safety. Battle cries snapped his attention back.

03:50:37.060 --> 03:50:44.020
 Beside him, one of the Jihar fell to its knee. It struggled to rise, but another warrior

03:50:44.020 --> 03:50:49.220
 lunged in close and his sword swing took the Jihar's head, black vapour spewed from the wound.

03:50:49.220 --> 03:50:56.340
 The Jihar that had been dragging Gandel let go of him to join the fray, sword rising and falling,

03:50:56.340 --> 03:50:59.940
 a warrior staggering away with a terrible gash from his forehead to his chin.

03:51:01.700 --> 03:51:05.140
 Gandel slipped and fell to the ground beside J.L. and grabbed at his boot.

03:51:05.140 --> 03:51:06.500
 "Help me!"

03:51:06.500 --> 03:51:11.060
 Gandel cried, trying to climb up J.L.'s leg and pull himself back to his feet.

03:51:11.060 --> 03:51:16.500
 J.L.'s sneered down at him, remembering how Gandel had mocked him back in his tent.

03:51:16.500 --> 03:51:19.940
 "I don't need you, or your horse is now."

03:51:19.940 --> 03:51:26.500
 He pulled his sword back and stabbed it into Gandel's screaming mouth, smashing teeth,

03:51:26.500 --> 03:51:29.540
 on into the soft tissue of his throat, jucked it out red,

03:51:29.540 --> 03:51:33.540
 left the king of carnit and bleeding out his life in the dirt of fawn.

03:51:33.540 --> 03:51:39.380
 Looking up again, he saw that the last few moments of frantic combat

03:51:39.380 --> 03:51:42.340
 had swung them close to the woman he was sure was fiddily.

03:51:42.340 --> 03:51:47.140
 At last, fate smiles upon me once more.

03:51:47.140 --> 03:51:52.500
 He swerved around a massive combat and strode straight towards her.

03:51:52.500 --> 03:51:57.380
 Chapter 17

03:51:57.380 --> 03:51:59.220
 Makin

03:51:59.220 --> 03:52:04.900
 Makin burst out from the rows of tents onto the embankment.

03:52:04.900 --> 03:52:08.820
 The tangled snare of form forest loomed close by.

03:52:08.820 --> 03:52:14.260
 At the top of the embankment, Gandel's new road carved a line into the trees.

03:52:14.260 --> 03:52:19.620
 Figures fought upon it, the clamour and stench of combat drifting down to Makin.

03:52:21.140 --> 03:52:23.140
 Where is he? Where's jail?

03:52:23.140 --> 03:52:29.700
 As he had run through the fractured camp, memory upon memory had flooded Makin's mind.

03:52:29.700 --> 03:52:35.620
 Over lifetime, a served as Castel's oath sworn shieldman, a friendship, loyalty and love,

03:52:35.620 --> 03:52:39.220
 and finally one memory overwhelming all of the others.

03:52:39.220 --> 03:52:43.620
 Of jail, plunging a sword into Castel's belly.

03:52:43.620 --> 03:52:50.100
 Those few heartbeats replayed in his mind time and time again until his whole world was a place of

03:52:50.100 --> 03:52:52.100
 heartbreak and rage.

03:52:52.100 --> 03:52:55.140
 Where is he?

03:52:55.140 --> 03:52:57.140
 He came this way, I know it.

03:52:57.140 --> 03:53:02.340
 Makin had lived in form with a gathering and learned the way of wood and forest.

03:53:02.340 --> 03:53:05.940
 Not that jail was hard to track.

03:53:05.940 --> 03:53:08.260
 He'd left a trail of his own blood for Makin to follow.

03:53:08.260 --> 03:53:11.860
 But where now?

03:53:11.860 --> 03:53:14.340
 Which way did he go?

03:53:14.340 --> 03:53:18.500
 Makin knelt in the grass, searching, fingertips running across the ground.

03:53:19.220 --> 03:53:21.220
 They came away, sticky.

03:53:21.220 --> 03:53:23.940
 Blood.

03:53:23.940 --> 03:53:25.940
 Another patch had paced up the embankment.

03:53:25.940 --> 03:53:30.660
 Something crossed Makin's face part's smile, part's smile,

03:53:30.660 --> 03:53:33.540
 and he bounded up the slope to the road.

03:53:33.540 --> 03:53:39.140
 Battle was mostly finished here, the dead littering the ground, others lying and waiting for

03:53:39.140 --> 03:53:43.700
 death's last touch, wounds gaping, screams and weeping,

03:53:43.700 --> 03:53:48.420
 ragged breaths, some men just sitting staring at blood-crossed palms.

03:53:49.220 --> 03:53:54.020
 Back all still raged further along the road, the trees of four on a tunnel about them.

03:53:54.020 --> 03:54:00.820
 Makin glimpsed kadashim in their coats of dark males scattered amongst the black and silver of

03:54:00.820 --> 03:54:01.780
 varied as his rear guard.

03:54:01.780 --> 03:54:07.780
 The figure moved beyond the combat, drawing his eye disappeared, re-appeared.

03:54:07.780 --> 03:54:12.420
 A man, dark-haired, just a glimpse, but Makin knew him.

03:54:13.780 --> 03:54:20.340
 jail. He ran, leaping the fallen, a shortsword, hissing from a scabbard across his back,

03:54:20.340 --> 03:54:23.700
 a knife gripped in his other hand, never taking his eyes from jail.

03:54:23.700 --> 03:54:30.340
 Behind him, Makin heard the drum of many feet, over it, a heavier thud,

03:54:30.340 --> 03:54:33.140
 knew that Alcyon and the others had arrived.

03:54:33.140 --> 03:54:39.540
 He ran on, skirting the combat, glimpsed veridists with a handful of men bring a kadashim to

03:54:39.540 --> 03:54:42.340
 bay, like a hound snapping at a bear or wolfin.

03:54:42.340 --> 03:54:48.900
 Makin gave it all barely a glance, because he was close to jail now, so close he could see his

03:54:48.900 --> 03:54:50.740
 eyes, the cut across his scalp.

03:54:50.740 --> 03:54:56.580
 He was heading diagonally across the combat through it, and Makin followed,

03:54:56.580 --> 03:55:02.340
 a wraith that wound his way through the tumult, ducking, bending, swaying, always moving.

03:55:04.020 --> 03:55:10.260
 Dimley behind him, he heard voices raised in battle cry, Alcyon's deep base rumbling over it,

03:55:10.260 --> 03:55:11.940
 like an avalanche as he joined the fray.

03:55:11.940 --> 03:55:18.260
 Makin hardly noticed. He was so close, a dozen paces behind jail, when he lost sight of him

03:55:18.260 --> 03:55:23.140
 for a moment, heard the harsh clang of iron at grunts, the thud of a body hitting the ground,

03:55:23.140 --> 03:55:26.500
 then a scream, higher pitched. A woman scream.

03:55:26.500 --> 03:55:30.020
 No. Dear Elion, no.

03:55:31.700 --> 03:55:36.420
 He knew that voice, would recognise it anywhere, fiddly.

03:55:36.420 --> 03:55:42.340
 He shouldered one of Ripper's warriors out of the way, and burst through the last knot of combat.

03:55:42.340 --> 03:55:49.220
 A warrior lay dead at his feet, others standing, pointing swords and spears at a figure further along

03:55:49.220 --> 03:55:56.740
 the road. Jail. He stood facing Makin, one arm around fiddily's throats,

03:55:56.740 --> 03:56:00.660
 resting his sword blade against the pulse in her neck, his other hand holding a knife tiked

03:56:00.660 --> 03:56:07.220
 to her ribs. Follow me? And she's dead. Jail said calmly.

03:56:07.220 --> 03:56:14.500
 He shuffled backwards, dragging fiddily with him. She saw Makin appear from the crowd, their eyes

03:56:14.500 --> 03:56:19.460
 touching. She did not appear scared if anything. She looked angry.

03:56:19.460 --> 03:56:27.540
 An emotion I know well. A warrior beside Makin took a step forwards and jail moved,

03:56:27.540 --> 03:56:30.180
 a line of blood trickled from the blade at fiddily's throat.

03:56:30.180 --> 03:56:34.420
 Makin grabbed a fist full of the warrior's shirt and held him still.

03:56:34.420 --> 03:56:39.380
 "That's better," Jail said, a smile twitching his lips.

03:56:39.380 --> 03:56:44.980
 "How Makin hated that smile. I'm going to walk away.

03:56:44.980 --> 03:56:51.060
 Have no fear. I'm not harmless lady. I know who she is, fiddily of Tenabral.

03:56:51.060 --> 03:56:57.300
 She will be safe with me, but she will stay with me. And if any of you should follow,

03:56:57.620 --> 03:57:01.460
 he prodded fiddily in the ribs with his knife, making her grimace.

03:57:01.460 --> 03:57:09.220
 She was still staring at Makin. Trust me, Makin mouthed and stepped out from the crowd.

03:57:09.220 --> 03:57:15.220
 The muscles in jail sawed arm tensed, then he recognized Makin and paused.

03:57:15.220 --> 03:57:19.780
 "Not you again," Jail sighed. "Don't you ever give up?"

03:57:19.780 --> 03:57:26.180
 Makin took a pace forwards. "Do you wish to be responsible for the death of fiddily,

03:57:26.180 --> 03:57:31.380
 Lady of Tenabral," Jail snapped, resuming his slow shuffle back down the road.

03:57:31.380 --> 03:57:37.860
 "Kill her," Makin growled, taking another step forwards focused on Jail's eyes.

03:57:37.860 --> 03:57:42.900
 "Stay back," Jail said, his voice rising in pitch. "Or she dies."

03:57:42.900 --> 03:57:51.300
 "Did you not hear me?" Makin said, taking another step. "Kill her. I care not.

03:57:51.300 --> 03:57:57.060
 Either way, this is where you die. Nothing will change that now."

03:57:57.060 --> 03:58:02.020
 He took another pace forwards and another, closing the cap between them.

03:58:02.020 --> 03:58:06.900
 Jail stumbled backwards, dragging fiddily with him.

03:58:06.900 --> 03:58:08.500
 "Are you mad?"

03:58:08.500 --> 03:58:15.540
 "She is the mother of Nithir. She is the first lady of Tenabral. Her war band is standing behind you.

03:58:15.540 --> 03:58:18.180
 harm her, and they will gut you."

03:58:19.620 --> 03:58:24.180
 Makin shrugged. "Once you're dead, they can do what they like to me."

03:58:24.180 --> 03:58:28.340
 "Stop!" Jail squeached, his knife hand pulling back.

03:58:28.340 --> 03:58:35.140
 Makin stopped. "I have an offer for you," he said, as he slowly bent his knees,

03:58:35.140 --> 03:58:38.180
 laid his sword and knife on the ground. "An offer?"

03:58:38.180 --> 03:58:43.220
 "I." Makin reached over his shoulder and drew his other sword,

03:58:43.220 --> 03:58:47.220
 laid that on the ground, too, and sheathed a knife from his belt,

03:58:47.220 --> 03:58:52.500
 another from a shoulder strap, one from the back of his boot, laying them all upon the ground.

03:58:52.500 --> 03:59:00.180
 "Let her go. I'll fight you, unarmed. Keep your sword and your knife."

03:59:00.180 --> 03:59:05.140
 He stood straight and raised his hands, started walking forwards again.

03:59:05.140 --> 03:59:11.540
 "You are insane!" Jail snorted, eyes glancing from the key into the pile of weapons on the ground.

03:59:12.580 --> 03:59:17.700
 "Maybe," Makin shrugged. "You murdered my wards, my friend."

03:59:17.700 --> 03:59:28.020
 Castell was as a son to me. "I will see you dead even if I have to do it with my bare hands."

03:59:28.020 --> 03:59:36.020
 He could see the indecision in jail's eyes. The man was tempted. That was clear, and why not?

03:59:37.220 --> 03:59:43.300
 He was a master with the sword, with any blade, and had both sword and knife in his hands against an unarmed man.

03:59:43.300 --> 03:59:46.100
 "You've more knives hidden away."

03:59:46.100 --> 03:59:50.740
 "No," Makin shook his head. "You're just afraid to fight me."

03:59:50.740 --> 03:59:54.420
 Jail snorted, but stopped his backward shuffling.

03:59:54.420 --> 03:59:58.260
 "You're afraid," Makin said louder.

03:59:58.260 --> 04:00:04.100
 "You," Jail, murderer, and usurper, are cowered as well.

04:00:05.860 --> 04:00:10.660
 A moment's pause. Jail's eyes narrowing. Then he was lifting his sword arms

04:00:10.660 --> 04:00:12.420
 a club fiddle air across the back of the head.

04:00:12.420 --> 04:00:18.580
 In that breath, she stamped on his foot and drove an elbow into his ribs, spinning around and

04:00:18.580 --> 04:00:24.260
 driving her knee into his groin. Jail staggered and rocked backwards, and then fiddle

04:00:24.260 --> 04:00:30.100
 was leaping away from him. "Bitch!" Jail snalled, moving after her, but clumsily.

04:00:31.140 --> 04:00:37.220
 In a heartbeat, Makin was standing in front of her. "Go," Makin breathed as he squeezed fiddly's hand.

04:00:37.220 --> 04:00:41.780
 "Dimally, he was aware of silence settling behind him."

04:00:41.780 --> 04:00:48.100
 "Go," he said firmer, and heard her footsteps pad a dozen or so paces away.

04:00:48.100 --> 04:00:52.980
 Jail paused, looking at Makin's empty hands.

04:00:52.980 --> 04:00:57.140
 "You really don't have any more weapons," he said.

04:00:57.940 --> 04:01:02.580
 Another smirk. "You actually are insane. I'm going to enjoy this."

04:01:02.580 --> 04:01:08.340
 "Don't need my own blade," Makin said. "I'll just take one of yours."

04:01:08.340 --> 04:01:14.340
 He strode forwards, swayed away from Jail's diagonally chopping sword,

04:01:14.340 --> 04:01:19.300
 pivoted past a stab of Jail's knife, stepped in close and punched Jail in the ribs,

04:01:19.300 --> 04:01:24.900
 making him cry out. Another punch to the sword cut on Jail's leg elicited a grunts of pain.

04:01:26.740 --> 04:01:32.100
 "For Castell," Makin said, close to Jail's ear, then he was spinning away.

04:01:32.100 --> 04:01:39.700
 Jail cursed, visibly mastered his pain, set his stance and came at Makin, carefully,

04:01:39.700 --> 04:01:41.460
 sword held high, knife low.

04:01:41.460 --> 04:01:44.820
 Makin stepped in to meet Jail,

04:01:44.820 --> 04:01:49.700
 part of his hand slapping the blade of Jail's sword away as he attempted a straight lunge,

04:01:49.700 --> 04:01:54.100
 grabbed Jail's knife wrist, and head butted the man full on the bridge of his nose.

04:01:55.460 --> 04:01:59.060
 Jail spluttered, blood gushing, Makin shoving him back.

04:01:59.060 --> 04:02:02.660
 "For Castell," Makin growled.

04:02:02.660 --> 04:02:09.220
 Jail spat, cuffed blood from his face, danced forward swinging his sword.

04:02:09.220 --> 04:02:15.460
 Makin ducked, air whistling over his head, he twisted felt a hot pain lant along his ribs,

04:02:15.460 --> 04:02:20.260
 heard shouting behind him, punched Jail on his injured leg again as he spun out of range,

04:02:20.260 --> 04:02:24.580
 heard another cry of pain. "For Castell," he breathed.

04:02:24.580 --> 04:02:30.020
 "Gail looked at a red line that his knife had scored through the leather of Makin's jerking.

04:02:30.020 --> 04:02:32.500
 "Blead, like the rest of us then."

04:02:32.500 --> 04:02:38.100
 Makin ignored him and darted forwards, weaved past a sword thrust,

04:02:38.100 --> 04:02:42.340
 kicked out at Jail's ankle, connecting, hand chopping at Jail's throats,

04:02:42.340 --> 04:02:44.100
 grabbing his knife hand and twisting.

04:02:44.100 --> 04:02:48.900
 Jail squelked in pain, his knife clattering to the road,

04:02:48.900 --> 04:02:51.540
 Makin kicking it away and darting out of range.

04:02:52.660 --> 04:02:56.740
 "For Castell," he said, as he spun away again.

04:02:56.740 --> 04:02:58.180
 "Stop saying that!"

04:02:58.180 --> 04:03:02.180
 Jail yelled at him, spickle flying, then ran at him more of a hobble.

04:03:02.180 --> 04:03:08.420
 Makin stooped to sweep up the fallen knife, twisting away from Jail's sword,

04:03:08.420 --> 04:03:09.860
 slashed once with the knife.

04:03:09.860 --> 04:03:14.180
 Jail cried out with pain as he stumbled on almost falling.

04:03:14.180 --> 04:03:19.620
 He regained his balance and backed away from Makin, limping as blood ran down the back of his leg.

04:03:20.580 --> 04:03:24.500
 Makin strode at him for the first time seeing fear in Jail's eyes.

04:03:24.500 --> 04:03:26.900
 "Do you remember?"

04:03:26.900 --> 04:03:32.580
 "In the tomb, beneath Haldis," Makin said, not breaking the stride.

04:03:32.580 --> 04:03:36.180
 "It was a fair fight," Jail said, pleading, shuffling away,

04:03:36.180 --> 04:03:37.940
 leaving a trail of blood from his wounded leg.

04:03:37.940 --> 04:03:44.820
 "He was your kin, and you betrayed him, you murdered him," Makin said.

04:03:44.820 --> 04:03:50.020
 Exploding into movement, leaping forwards, dancing to the side around Jail's sword,

04:03:50.020 --> 04:03:53.620
 a slice at Jail's arm, a yell, and the sword was falling.

04:03:53.620 --> 04:03:58.580
 They crashed into each other, limbs tangled, fell to the ground, rolled,

04:03:58.580 --> 04:04:02.260
 Jail finding new strength as he punched kicked and bit at Makin.

04:04:02.260 --> 04:04:07.300
 Makin grabbed one of Jail's arms, pinned it as they rolled together,

04:04:07.300 --> 04:04:10.100
 inched his knife blade up towards Jail's throats.

04:04:10.100 --> 04:04:12.580
 Jail's efforts redoubled.

04:04:12.580 --> 04:04:18.020
 His free fist, punching at Makin's head, his guts, anywhere, everywhere.

04:04:18.900 --> 04:04:20.980
 Makin grunted but did not let go.

04:04:20.980 --> 04:04:26.260
 Jail was grabbing at Makin's wrist and able to stop it moving remorselessly upwards.

04:04:26.260 --> 04:04:32.580
 They rolled to a halt, Makin squeezed, twisted, jailed, pinned arm cracked.

04:04:32.580 --> 04:04:38.580
 Jail screamed high and long as a stuck bore, the fight draining from him.

04:04:38.580 --> 04:04:44.740
 Then Makin's knife was at Jail's throat, tip pressing into the soft flesh at the base of the jaw.

04:04:44.740 --> 04:04:47.140
 "Please," Jail sobbed.

04:04:48.420 --> 04:04:50.900
 "For Castell," Makin whispered.

04:04:50.900 --> 04:04:54.500
 Then he shoved the blade up with all his strength.

04:04:54.500 --> 04:05:01.780
 Jail made a choking sound, gurgling on dark blood that welded from his mouth dribbled down his chin.

04:05:01.780 --> 04:05:08.660
 He struggled, but Makin pushed the blade deeper on into his skull, kept pushing until the knife's

04:05:08.660 --> 04:05:10.660
 hilt was tight to Jail's flesh.

04:05:10.660 --> 04:05:17.380
 Jail's eyes bulged, then he spasomed, legs kicking slowed, became still.

04:05:18.020 --> 04:05:22.500
 "Making wronged away," slowly stood and looked down upon Jail.

04:05:22.500 --> 04:05:30.660
 He grimaced, part snarled, felt suddenly weak and dropped to his knees, then sat and stared at Jail's corpse.

04:05:30.660 --> 04:05:33.780
 "You are avenged, Castell."

04:05:33.780 --> 04:05:36.580
 "You were like a son to me."

04:05:36.580 --> 04:05:41.940
 He felt his shoulders begin to shake, tears blur his vision,

04:05:41.940 --> 04:05:46.900
 and then a hand was striking his head, a warm body beside him pulling him into an embrace.

04:05:46.900 --> 04:05:54.660
 "He laid his head upon Fridale's breast and wept. He didn't know how long he remained like that,

04:05:54.660 --> 04:06:00.020
 but in time, the world opened up from that small pinpoint of grief, and he became aware of voices.

04:06:00.020 --> 04:06:05.380
 He looked up and saw the warband of Ripper gathered in a half-circle about him.

04:06:05.380 --> 04:06:11.380
 There it is, Krelis, Albin, Alcyon, and so many others, hundreds of them, all watching him.

04:06:12.980 --> 04:06:19.300
 "Well, that was a cracking fire and old and eyeing," Krelis said, nodding to my keen,

04:06:19.300 --> 04:06:23.460
 lifting a skin of mead to his lips and drinking deep. "What now?"

04:06:23.460 --> 04:06:29.140
 Fidale answered. "Now we march on Drasil."

04:06:29.140 --> 04:06:35.940
 CHAPTER 18

04:06:38.580 --> 04:06:43.380
 Coven stood in the great courtyard before the gates of Drasil, alongside her fellow prisoners.

04:06:43.380 --> 04:06:48.580
 Caledus walked down the staircase that led to the battlements where he had announced his

04:06:48.580 --> 04:06:54.660
 challenge to Corbin as he did each and every morning. "Save the lives of your people.

04:06:54.660 --> 04:06:56.500
 Stop their torture."

04:06:56.500 --> 04:07:03.860
 As always, Corven did not come, and now Caledus began the second half of each day's ritual,

04:07:03.860 --> 04:07:08.180
 choosing a prisoner to be impaled within the courtyard.

04:07:08.820 --> 04:07:14.260
 "Almost a moon had passed since Drasil had fallen so unimaginably quickly.

04:07:14.260 --> 04:07:17.460
 A moon of heartache and pain."

04:07:17.460 --> 04:07:23.940
 Although she was a prisoner, Coen had been allowed to take charge of the makeshift hospice

04:07:23.940 --> 04:07:28.660
 that she and Brenad spent so long stalking and preparing, choosing a few staff to help her

04:07:28.660 --> 04:07:33.540
 from amongst the more able-bodied prisoners. She was permitted to heal the captured,

04:07:33.540 --> 04:07:37.620
 only if she also looked after those of the fairs army who had been wounded in the battle.

04:07:38.260 --> 04:07:44.900
 "Much as Coen despised doing so, she knew it was the only way to help her own people."

04:07:44.900 --> 04:07:50.660
 Caledus stopped to dozen steps up from the courtyard and looked at the gathered prisoners.

04:07:50.660 --> 04:07:57.780
 "It seems that your bright star has better things to do than save your lives," he said.

04:07:57.780 --> 04:07:59.620
 "Voice laced with anger."

04:07:59.620 --> 04:08:03.940
 Coen shivered involuntarily at the thought of what was the calm of the screams.

04:08:05.620 --> 04:08:07.300
 "She was no stranger to death now.

04:08:07.300 --> 04:08:11.060
 But nothing could make her immune to the horror she witnessed each morning."

04:08:11.060 --> 04:08:12.980
 Coen.

04:08:12.980 --> 04:08:14.500
 "Come and save us."

04:08:14.500 --> 04:08:18.740
 With each passing day, it seemed more impossible.

04:08:18.740 --> 04:08:23.300
 For the first few days, she had been practically convinced that her brother would somehow

04:08:23.300 --> 04:08:26.820
 return with a war band and a win-back Drasil defeat their enemy.

04:08:26.820 --> 04:08:31.620
 But with each screen filled morning, that hope had withered.

04:08:33.300 --> 04:08:38.260
 Caledus gave a curtain nod, and a catish him stepped out from the shadows of the stable blocks,

04:08:38.260 --> 04:08:40.660
 moving amongst the prisoners, dragging one forwards.

04:08:40.660 --> 04:08:47.460
 As always, Coen's heart seemed to freeze, feeling as if it swelled to fill her chest

04:08:47.460 --> 04:08:50.260
 as a single catish him walked down the line that she was standing in.

04:08:50.260 --> 04:08:55.940
 "It was the figure that was always surrounded by billowing clouds of flies."

04:08:55.940 --> 04:08:58.580
 It paused before her.

04:08:59.620 --> 04:09:02.820
 One fist grabbing her chin and lifting it to stare into her eyes,

04:09:02.820 --> 04:09:06.020
 though there was nothing there, its eyes were black, soulless wells.

04:09:06.020 --> 04:09:12.180
 A lunatic grin twisted its mouth in a black tongue flicked out from its mouth,

04:09:12.180 --> 04:09:15.380
 thick and swollen, and slowly licked her cheek.

04:09:15.380 --> 04:09:20.820
 She reached from its foul breath, but the catish him held her immovable,

04:09:20.820 --> 04:09:23.700
 while flies crawled over her face up her nose.

04:09:25.620 --> 04:09:36.500
 "One day, soon!" it whispered in her ear, "I will crash your skull and suck the jelly from your eyes."

04:09:36.500 --> 04:09:43.460
 Then it released her, grabbing the man beside her, one of those who had been saved from the

04:09:43.460 --> 04:09:48.980
 Van Thalen all benches, and dragged him towards a stake. He began to plead, then wail.

04:09:50.500 --> 04:09:56.340
 It did not good. And soon his horrific screams were ringing out, a cacophony of torment.

04:09:56.340 --> 04:09:59.060
 There was no hiding from it.

04:09:59.060 --> 04:10:06.660
 The sound climbed, sweeping over the walls, and on, out over the plains surrounding the

04:10:06.660 --> 04:10:08.900
 fortress into the silent trees of form.

04:10:08.900 --> 04:10:13.700
 Have Corbin and the survivors fled? Or retreated?

04:10:15.300 --> 04:10:19.460
 Call it a strode down from the back of a step, and with an irritable wave of his hand,

04:10:19.460 --> 04:10:21.860
 signaled for the surviving prisoners to be taken away.

04:10:21.860 --> 04:10:27.540
 The warriors of Tenabral in black and silver, heard it co-in and the others out of the courtyard.

04:10:27.540 --> 04:10:32.740
 She wrinkled her nose as they passed the stables, the stench of Nefair's drag,

04:10:32.740 --> 04:10:38.180
 clawing up her nose. She had smelt a lot of bad things in her time, but nothing like

04:10:38.180 --> 04:10:43.620
 the smell of drag dung. She heard a horse nay as they moved past the stables.

04:10:44.260 --> 04:10:51.860
 SHIELD. When Drassel had fallen to Callidus and Nefair's warband, the stables had been full of

04:10:51.860 --> 04:10:57.140
 horses, great war horses at the Jihad Road, a whole herd that had been saved from the destruction

04:10:57.140 --> 04:11:03.780
 of Graham's hold. They were still there, and created another task that prisoners were used for,

04:11:03.780 --> 04:11:10.100
 stabled UT, tending to the horses. Every time that Corbin was picked, she had managed to get

04:11:10.100 --> 04:11:16.260
 close to SHIELD, Corbin's stallion. As they left the courtyard and entered a wide street,

04:11:16.260 --> 04:11:19.220
 shouts rang out from the wall, then a horn sounded.

04:11:19.220 --> 04:11:25.460
 The great bars across the gates were drawn back, and the gates opened with a juddering creek.

04:11:25.460 --> 04:11:31.060
 Figures filled the open gates, silhouettes with the sign behind them.

04:11:31.060 --> 04:11:34.820
 They became clearer as they spilt into the courtyard.

04:11:35.780 --> 04:11:39.700
 Vin Thalen, a score, two score, maybe more. Many of them were wounded.

04:11:39.700 --> 04:11:48.420
 So something is out there then. Hidden within the trees of form. Something with teeth of iron.

04:11:48.420 --> 04:11:54.660
 As she was marched away from the courtyard, Coen felt a seed of hope, glimmer, deep inside.

04:11:54.660 --> 04:12:00.820
 It was faints and fragile, and it wasn't helped much by what she saw around her on her way

04:12:00.820 --> 04:12:06.660
 back to the hospice. Caddishing were prowling the streets, moving like shadows, their heads,

04:12:06.660 --> 04:12:12.660
 twitching at every sound. All around her, she saw a host of Eagle Guard in her black and silver,

04:12:12.660 --> 04:12:17.460
 manning gates and walls, filling once abandoned buildings, working at forge and barn,

04:12:17.460 --> 04:12:22.260
 and the Vin Thalen were everywhere. Many of them were half drunk and fighting,

04:12:22.260 --> 04:12:26.660
 loitering on street corners, sitting in impromptu circles and throwing dice of bone.

04:12:28.340 --> 04:12:33.060
 The numbers of her enemies seemed vast, far more than Corbin's war band had ever been,

04:12:33.060 --> 04:12:40.580
 even a full strength. Could we ever have won? The dead from the battle had mostly been cleared

04:12:40.580 --> 04:12:45.700
 from the streets now, here and there a dark stain on a flagstone acting as a stark reminder.

04:12:45.700 --> 04:12:51.860
 As Coen turned a corner, she saw a dog sniffing in a heap to rubbish pile.

04:12:51.860 --> 04:12:57.780
 The dog was small and white, a ratter. I know that dog.

04:12:58.100 --> 04:13:05.700
 It was Halen's. What happened to him? She looked at the dog as she was marched past it,

04:13:05.700 --> 04:13:11.940
 it was skinny and half starved, ribs visible. Halen must be dead. He loved that dog,

04:13:11.940 --> 04:13:20.500
 pots, he called him. Just like my poor buddye. What happened to him? She had not seen him since

04:13:20.500 --> 04:13:26.820
 before the battle. Perhaps he'd been killed or maybe flared, though, deep in her heart she doubted

04:13:26.820 --> 04:13:30.900
 that. He was too loyal, would not have left me like that.

04:13:30.900 --> 04:13:35.300
 She drew level with the white dog and clicked her tongue,

04:13:35.300 --> 04:13:38.500
 reached inside a pocket in her cloak and pulled out a chunk of bread.

04:13:38.500 --> 04:13:45.620
 The dog lifted its head sniffing and after a moment's cautious indecision, darted over to her.

04:13:45.620 --> 04:13:50.660
 She dropped the piece of bread and caught it definitely, and it was gone.

04:13:52.260 --> 04:13:57.140
 She watched it scamper away, turn a corner and disappear. For a moment,

04:13:57.140 --> 04:13:59.940
 she thought she saw something waiting for it moving in the shadows.

04:13:59.940 --> 04:14:07.140
 Guards ushered her and the other prisoners into the hospice, less than 300 of them now because

04:14:07.140 --> 04:14:12.420
 of Caledas's morning ritual. The building was large enough to accommodate their numbers with

04:14:12.420 --> 04:14:18.660
 the lower floor made of two interlinking chambers. Part of it had been partitioned off for the

04:14:18.660 --> 04:14:22.020
 care of the injured. The rest turned into a makeshift prison for the others.

04:14:22.020 --> 04:14:26.980
 Only one guard came into the hospice, the rest sitting out in the courtyard.

04:14:26.980 --> 04:14:30.100
 Cohen heard the sound of dice on a throwboard.

04:14:30.100 --> 04:14:36.500
 Automatically, she went into the adjoining chamber and checked on the injured, not many of them

04:14:36.500 --> 04:14:42.260
 left now. There had been a lot more after the battle, but many had died. Cohen being unable

04:14:42.260 --> 04:14:45.460
 to do a little more for them than ease their passing across the bridge of swords.

04:14:47.140 --> 04:14:51.380
 Now only a score remained in here, although from what she'd just seen,

04:14:51.380 --> 04:14:55.060
 she expected that her skill would now be required for the injured of enthalin.

04:14:55.060 --> 04:14:58.900
 Frankly, she'd rather poison than heal them.

04:14:58.900 --> 04:15:05.620
 Do not give up, she told herself. Remembering her time as a prisoner with an affair in Caledas.

04:15:05.620 --> 04:15:12.820
 All had seemed hopeless then. That time, Corbin had come out of nowhere and rescued her.

04:15:14.100 --> 04:15:19.140
 Although ma'am died in the undertaking. I'll not let that happen again. People dying for my

04:15:19.140 --> 04:15:23.940
 saving. I'll not wait around to be rescued. I will make my own fortune. Whatever the cost.

04:15:23.940 --> 04:15:32.500
 Cohen opened her eyes. After counting 100 heartbeats and not hearing anything else but the usual

04:15:32.500 --> 04:15:39.300
 snoring, she turned her head to check on their enthalin guard. As expected, he was asleep.

04:15:40.900 --> 04:15:45.060
 Beyond the doors she heard the muted sound of conversation, the occasional burst of laughter,

04:15:45.060 --> 04:15:48.500
 the rest of their guards sitting in the courtyard drinking and gambling.

04:15:48.500 --> 04:15:55.300
 At first, their guards had been vigilant and rightly so because there had been a

04:15:55.300 --> 04:15:59.460
 smattering of Jihad amongst the captives and they did not take well to being made prisoners.

04:15:59.460 --> 04:16:04.260
 On the first night, two had attempted escape killing eight guards,

04:16:04.260 --> 04:16:06.580
 maiming three more and setting fire to another.

04:16:08.180 --> 04:16:12.740
 Eventually, they had both been subdued and executed in the courtyard the next day.

04:16:12.740 --> 04:16:18.820
 Since then, no more escapes had been attempted and over time the guards had become

04:16:18.820 --> 04:16:25.380
 correspondingly less vigilant. Cohen patted slowly from the room, making her way to a set of

04:16:25.380 --> 04:16:30.260
 stairs leading up to a balcony that looked down upon the main hall with a dozen rooms opening

04:16:30.260 --> 04:16:37.460
 off it. Almost silently, she passed into one of those rooms. There was one large window that

04:16:37.460 --> 04:16:41.300
 let in a wide beam of moonlight, shockingly bright in the darkness.

04:16:41.300 --> 04:16:47.860
 Cohen traced a familiar path to a cupboard, opened the door, shifted a loose board inside,

04:16:47.860 --> 04:16:54.100
 and lifted out a package. She shuffled over to the window, sat with her back to the wall,

04:16:54.100 --> 04:16:59.940
 facing the dark silhouette of the open doorway. She opened the old linen she'd wrapped round it

04:16:59.940 --> 04:17:05.780
 to reveal a book, leather bound and worn. She opened it towards the back and started

04:17:05.780 --> 04:17:15.700
 reading the spidery script, wood, eigen, low, hara, agada, a guarding spell.

04:17:15.700 --> 04:17:23.780
 Akachir Anteil, boiling water, worm root, flayed skin.

04:17:23.780 --> 04:17:32.420
 She paused there, a shiver goose bumping her flesh. What did I expect from a book of giant spells?

04:17:33.460 --> 04:17:38.820
 She pulled a face, fear, and revulsion. It depends either skin belonged to, I suppose,

04:17:38.820 --> 04:17:42.100
 if it came from Caledus or Nefair or Lycus, Moorcant or Rin,

04:17:42.100 --> 04:17:47.140
 the list grew in her mind of enemies she'd like to do terrible things to.

04:17:47.140 --> 04:17:55.140
 Bruno said, "It is a tool, not an evil of itself. It is how I use it. That's important."

04:17:55.140 --> 04:18:01.460
 She became aware of a sound, a soft snuffling from out of the window,

04:18:01.460 --> 04:18:09.220
 leaves rustled. Something in herbed beds. Slowly, as quietly as she could manage,

04:18:09.220 --> 04:18:11.860
 she peered up over the window's edge and looked out.

04:18:11.860 --> 04:18:17.860
 Something was moving through the herb garden, nose to the ground, moving steadily toward the

04:18:17.860 --> 04:18:23.860
 hospice. It paused, its white form reflecting moonlight, and looked up at Cohen.

04:18:25.380 --> 04:18:32.180
 It's the dog from earlier, Halen's ratter. The dog turned in a circle and jumped on the spot.

04:18:32.180 --> 04:18:39.780
 Cohen was scared they would start barking. Then, movement caught her eye, further back in a

04:18:39.780 --> 04:18:44.420
 shadowed recess on the far side of the herb garden, a solid patch in the darkness.

04:18:44.420 --> 04:18:50.660
 It wind, moved into the moonlight. Cohen's breath caught in her chest.

04:18:51.860 --> 04:18:58.740
 Good eye. Without thinking, she jumped from the window, dropping into the soft earth of her bed.

04:18:58.740 --> 04:19:03.540
 Before she had righted herself, Good Eye was bounding across the soft earth,

04:19:03.540 --> 04:19:06.580
 hurling himself against her rough tongue, licking her face, whining.

04:19:06.580 --> 04:19:12.660
 Shh. She whispered. Tears blurring her eyes as she kissed his muzzle.

04:19:12.660 --> 04:19:15.940
 He didn't listen to her sloppily licking her face.

04:19:17.300 --> 04:19:21.940
 Where have you been? She whispered, scratching him behind one floppy ear,

04:19:21.940 --> 04:19:24.340
 running her other hand along the thick muscle of his neck.

04:19:24.340 --> 04:19:27.620
 Been feeding alright by the look of you?

04:19:27.620 --> 04:19:33.940
 Something was tied around him. Cohen lifted it and inspected the long strip of leather.

04:19:33.940 --> 04:19:41.780
 A leash. Then another sound caught her attention, a rustling close by in her bed,

04:19:41.780 --> 04:19:46.020
 amongst the thick leaves of the basil and peppermint. She squinted,

04:19:46.740 --> 04:19:50.180
 narrowed her eyes, saw someone appear from between the greenery,

04:19:50.180 --> 04:19:56.180
 a face, small and pale, dirt stained. It was hailing.

04:19:56.180 --> 04:20:01.300
 Chapter 19.

04:20:01.300 --> 04:20:02.820
 Uphas.

04:20:02.820 --> 04:20:10.580
 Raven's and crows. Uphas muttered as he trudged through the marshland,

04:20:10.580 --> 04:20:16.580
 eyes looking skyward. He stumbled, his foot sinking with a splash into a

04:20:16.580 --> 04:20:20.660
 patch of soft ground. And he leaned on his spear to leave himself upright.

04:20:20.660 --> 04:20:25.380
 Salak, his shieldman, reached out to steadying hand from behind him.

04:20:25.380 --> 04:20:28.740
 Marshland is not a good place for a giant to walk.

04:20:28.740 --> 04:20:35.780
 What's that? Rin said. She was sitting in the stern of a large boat,

04:20:35.780 --> 04:20:38.820
 surrounded by a score of warriors as well as half a dozen rowers.

04:20:38.820 --> 04:20:44.980
 Uphas was picking apart alongside the banks of the waterways she was being rowed down,

04:20:44.980 --> 04:20:48.100
 a line of the Nothi giant spread out along the bank behind him.

04:20:48.100 --> 04:20:56.100
 Raven's uncrows. Uphas repeated, stopping and pointing up at the sky to where a black shape spiraled

04:20:56.100 --> 04:21:03.780
 higher above them. And what about them? Rin asked. She was in an unusually good mood this morning,

04:21:03.780 --> 04:21:08.260
 the first that Uphas had seen since she had learned of her war bands to feet in the marshes

04:21:08.260 --> 04:21:10.500
 and of the death of her huntsman, brave.

04:21:11.460 --> 04:21:16.980
 "I don't like them," Uphas grumbled, thinking of feck in the marons treacherous raven.

04:21:16.980 --> 04:21:24.500
 Rin stared up at the speck in the sky. "I've always rather light them," she said,

04:21:24.500 --> 04:21:28.740
 "and I suppose this one's a speck that will be providing its dinner."

04:21:28.740 --> 04:21:35.140
 Uphas scowled up at the bird. "I, as long as it's not her eyeballs and innards that it is

04:21:35.140 --> 04:21:42.500
 feasting upon." He looked around him. More boats filled the waterway, bursting with over a thousand

04:21:42.500 --> 04:21:48.980
 warriors. Not likely that will be losing this battle, he thought. Looking at the grim faces of men

04:21:48.980 --> 04:21:52.980
 in every boat, bristling with iron and the fifty Benothi warriors behind him.

04:21:52.980 --> 04:21:56.980
 More than enough to put down this little uprising.

04:21:56.980 --> 04:22:01.220
 But since they had left the tower at the marshland's edge,

04:22:01.220 --> 04:22:05.700
 a down mood had fallen across Uphas's shoulders like a heavy cloak and he could not shake it.

04:22:05.700 --> 04:22:10.820
 We should be getting on with the important business of finding Evanis and the necklace,

04:22:10.820 --> 04:22:15.700
 that is all that matters. Because when they found Namans necklace,

04:22:15.700 --> 04:22:20.580
 one of the seven treasures, then Uphas would be one huge step closer to achieving his dream.

04:22:20.580 --> 04:22:28.180
 King of the Giants. No more clans, no more divisions, just my kin behind me.

04:22:29.460 --> 04:22:36.180
 But first, I must find the necklace. Then it is to down and on Terrace to find the cup and then.

04:22:36.180 --> 04:22:42.580
 He's all brave for peer up ahead, moving smoothly across the ground. He's two hounds with him.

04:22:42.580 --> 04:22:48.740
 He ran across the marshland towards them, hardly glancing at where he was putting his feet.

04:22:48.740 --> 04:22:52.740
 Everything about the lads screamed vitality.

04:22:54.580 --> 04:23:00.180
 Uphas robbed at the small of his back and frowned. There is something about him,

04:23:00.180 --> 04:23:03.300
 Uphas mused, different. He hide something.

04:23:03.300 --> 04:23:09.620
 Rave comes with her set across the water to Rin. She held up a hand.

04:23:09.620 --> 04:23:14.980
 The rudderman of her boat guided them towards the bank, the rowers slowing.

04:23:14.980 --> 04:23:20.980
 All along their convoy, men did the same. The boats rippling to a halt like a long,

04:23:20.980 --> 04:23:27.780
 sinuous water snake. Is he alone? Rin asked, as Uphas took a hand and helped her step for the boat.

04:23:27.780 --> 04:23:28.100
 "I!"

04:23:28.100 --> 04:23:33.860
 Rave had been given a score of woodsman to help him scout out the ruins of done

04:23:33.860 --> 04:23:40.740
 crin, not that he seemed to need help. "Be careful," Uphas said. "I don't trust him."

04:23:40.740 --> 04:23:47.460
 "I don't trust anyone," Rin replied with a scathing look and fixed her eyes on Rave as he approached

04:23:47.460 --> 04:23:52.980
 him. His two hounds reached them first, prowling a circle around Uphas which he didn't like.

04:23:52.980 --> 04:23:57.780
 Rave sprang across a stream and pulled to a halt, dipping his head to Rin.

04:23:57.780 --> 04:24:02.660
 "Mike Queen?" he said. "Well?" Rin snapped.

04:24:02.660 --> 04:24:07.060
 "Don't crin as a head." A smile touched Rin's mouth.

04:24:07.060 --> 04:24:09.300
 "It is abandoned."

04:24:11.860 --> 04:24:17.700
 "Well, he wasn't lying," Uphas thought, as he stepped around a long branch willow and saw the

04:24:17.700 --> 04:24:22.980
 ancient fortress tearing out of the lake. He heard Salak mutter recurse behind him.

04:24:22.980 --> 04:24:27.140
 His shield murder not seen done crin before and it was a tragic sight,

04:24:27.140 --> 04:24:29.940
 the once-proud fortress laid low by time and circumstance.

04:24:29.940 --> 04:24:37.700
 Dark walls and towers reared from the lake's water, like these submerged boughs of a rotting tree,

04:24:37.700 --> 04:24:43.220
 read and slime hanging from the decaying battlements. A great work brought down.

04:24:43.220 --> 04:24:47.460
 When I am king, I will restore the glory of my kin."

04:24:47.460 --> 04:24:51.540
 Ahead of him, Rin histing frustration.

04:24:51.540 --> 04:24:59.860
 "There's no one here," Morcant said. "Your powers of observation are staggering," Rin said.

04:24:59.860 --> 04:25:02.980
 Barely contained rage dripping from each word.

04:25:04.660 --> 04:25:10.660
 A strange sound rang out overhead, making Uphas jump. He looked up and saw a scruffy looking

04:25:10.660 --> 04:25:16.420
 crow sitting in the branches of a willow. It was making a clacking sound almost like laughing.

04:25:16.420 --> 04:25:24.180
 Uphas gave it a dark look. Still making the odd noise, the crow winged into the air spiraled up

04:25:24.180 --> 04:25:30.420
 and flew away. Warriors were disembarking from boats to stand all along the lake shore.

04:25:31.860 --> 04:25:37.060
 Others had rode out to the waterlogged fortress, men climbing up onto the ancient battlements.

04:25:37.060 --> 04:25:42.740
 Uphas tugged on one of the worm teeth, set in his necklace as he stared at done grin,

04:25:42.740 --> 04:25:45.940
 eyes sweeping the lake shore, the willows and alders that lined it.

04:25:45.940 --> 04:25:52.420
 The signs of recent life all about, abandoned shelters, woven willow fences,

04:25:52.420 --> 04:25:54.900
 cold fire pits, fishing nets hanging.

04:25:56.180 --> 04:26:00.900
 A pile of burned clothing, old boots and belts, some twisted war gear, nothing of much use.

04:26:00.900 --> 04:26:05.140
 "The far shore," he said to Salak an eyes of aside him.

04:26:05.140 --> 04:26:09.140
 "They have young eyes than I." "Men could be hiding there."

04:26:09.140 --> 04:26:15.380
 "Can't see anything," Salak rumbled. "He was disappointed with us could tell.

04:26:15.380 --> 04:26:18.020
 His shieldmen have been looking forward to a fight."

04:26:18.020 --> 04:26:20.740
 "But it's far."

04:26:22.420 --> 04:26:26.500
 "No one there," Rafe said from a dozen strides away his back to them.

04:26:26.500 --> 04:26:28.340
 "He was standing staring at the far shore."

04:26:28.340 --> 04:26:32.260
 "Your eyes are good," Uphas asked.

04:26:32.260 --> 04:26:38.100
 "I can see a heron standing in the shade of that willow," Rafe said pointing.

04:26:38.100 --> 04:26:42.260
 Uphas squinted but could see nothing. Neither could Salak.

04:26:42.260 --> 04:26:47.860
 Then there was a distant splash and a heron rose from deep shadows flapping into the air.

04:26:49.620 --> 04:26:53.940
 Ryn barked orders and warriors began to sweep around both arms of the lake shore,

04:26:53.940 --> 04:26:56.180
 searching for hidden men wary of traps.

04:26:56.180 --> 04:27:00.900
 Word of the last campaign against his fortress was in everyone's mind.

04:27:00.900 --> 04:27:05.780
 "Live they left here," More can ask no one in particular.

04:27:05.780 --> 04:27:09.300
 "To avoid you, I would suspect," Ryn said.

04:27:09.300 --> 04:27:13.860
 More can't nod it at that, thinking it a perfectly reasonable answer.

04:27:13.860 --> 04:27:16.340
 "Well, we must chase them then," he said.

04:27:16.900 --> 04:27:20.820
 "A fine idea," Ryn muttered. "Or maybe not. What do you think, Rafe?"

04:27:20.820 --> 04:27:24.980
 The young huntsman frowned at that, was silent a while.

04:27:24.980 --> 04:27:30.820
 "I contract them for you, my lady," he eventually said. "But I don't think it would be wise

04:27:30.820 --> 04:27:32.500
 for your whole war-banting of chase."

04:27:32.500 --> 04:27:36.580
 We could be led straight into another trap like last time, or worse.

04:27:36.580 --> 04:27:41.780
 "Here we know the land, now, and your numbers would tell, out there,"

04:27:41.780 --> 04:27:45.140
 he gestured at the stinking marshland. "Who knows?"

04:27:45.860 --> 04:27:51.780
 "Calls were drifting over from the fortress, men signaling that the ruins were empty."

04:27:51.780 --> 04:27:56.820
 Other men started adding their voices from the lake shores they circled around.

04:27:56.820 --> 04:28:02.980
 "They are fled," Salak rumbled. "Yes," Ryn agreed sourly.

04:28:02.980 --> 04:28:07.860
 "But the question is not why, but where? Where are they?"

04:28:07.860 --> 04:28:11.940
 "Why we are stuck in the heart of Don Crane, where are they?"

04:28:11.940 --> 04:28:13.940
 "And what are they doing?"

04:28:14.340 --> 04:28:18.900
 "And where is Evanis?" With us thought. "He is the real prize."

04:28:18.900 --> 04:28:24.340
 "The only man with knowledge of when a man's necklace is, all else is smoke on the wind."

04:28:24.340 --> 04:28:30.420
 Voices shouted from further along the lake shore, a different tone and cadence.

04:28:30.420 --> 04:28:35.140
 Men appeared with someone definitely unworried like between them.

04:28:35.140 --> 04:28:42.420
 She was brought before Ryn, a woman of exceeding beauty, with us surmised beneath the starvation

04:28:42.420 --> 04:28:46.740
 grime that coated her. She was dark-haired with green eyes.

04:28:46.740 --> 04:28:53.380
 As she was held before Ryn, Uthessara host of emotions sweep this new woman's face,

04:28:53.380 --> 04:29:01.860
 pride, fear, hatred, hope. Ryn stared at her, then began to laugh.

04:29:06.020 --> 04:29:07.220
 CHAPTER 20

04:29:07.220 --> 04:29:08.580
 CAMLON

04:29:08.580 --> 04:29:14.500
 Torsious, CAMLON said, lifting his bow.

04:29:14.500 --> 04:29:18.900
 A flaming arrow leapt into the air, followed by 20 more,

04:29:18.900 --> 04:29:24.580
 all rising high into the blue sky, then arcing and falling towards the wooden tower and surrounding walls.

04:29:24.580 --> 04:29:32.740
 Again, CAMLON ordered, as the first volley slammed into the wooden palisade gates and buildings beyond.

04:29:34.580 --> 04:29:39.540
 Meg dipped her torch into an iron braisier, crackling with fire and ran along the line,

04:29:39.540 --> 04:29:42.180
 igniting the arrows of CAMLON and the twenty other archers.

04:29:42.180 --> 04:29:46.900
 They were standing on a shallow slope between the marshes and morquence tower.

04:29:46.900 --> 04:29:50.180
 He'd done his warband spread and a loose circle about it.

04:29:50.180 --> 04:29:54.900
 On a plane to CAMLON's right stood the remains of an abandoned camp.

04:29:54.900 --> 04:30:00.180
 Trampled grass, fire pits, torn tents, the stench of midden.

04:30:01.700 --> 04:30:05.540
 A lot of men filled that space, Ryn's not underestimating us this time,

04:30:05.540 --> 04:30:08.820
 though she'll be finding out soon that we're not playing by her rules.

04:30:08.820 --> 04:30:15.780
 CAMLON held his arrow tip in Meg's torch, the pitch and kindling catching with a hiss,

04:30:15.780 --> 04:30:18.980
 and then he was aiming high and loosing.

04:30:18.980 --> 04:30:21.620
 His arrow rising and falling amongst the others,

04:30:21.620 --> 04:30:23.860
 disappearing beyond the wall of morquence tower.

04:30:23.860 --> 04:30:27.940
 Already black smoke was billowing into the clear sky.

04:30:29.620 --> 04:30:33.140
 They'll see that for a fair few leagues around, Baird said behind him,

04:30:33.140 --> 04:30:35.700
 grinning as if he was in a mid-summer's fair.

04:30:35.700 --> 04:30:41.300
 He was stood to one side of Adana, Halion and Van close by,

04:30:41.300 --> 04:30:43.940
 as well as Lorken and his shieldman, Rogan.

04:30:43.940 --> 04:30:47.060
 "That's the idea," Adana said.

04:30:47.060 --> 04:30:51.460
 She was sterner. "Too long, Ryn has had this war her own way."

04:30:51.460 --> 04:30:55.940
 "Hi, this is a message as much as anything else.

04:30:55.940 --> 04:30:58.500
 Well, we'll not be dancing to Ryn's tune any longer."

04:30:58.500 --> 04:31:02.580
 CAMLON held out another arrow for Meg to light.

04:31:02.580 --> 04:31:06.980
 The gate tower was a crackling torch now,

04:31:06.980 --> 04:31:11.060
 morquence tower beyond catching bright flames licking one side.

04:31:11.060 --> 04:31:15.460
 Figures were running along the wall, bucket of water were being thrown,

04:31:15.460 --> 04:31:16.980
 but it seemed to be having little effect.

04:31:16.980 --> 04:31:20.020
 Two few of them, CAMLON thought.

04:31:20.020 --> 04:31:22.660
 Can't be mourned 30 men in there.

04:31:22.660 --> 04:31:26.340
 Ryn's taken everyone else into the marshes looking for us.

04:31:27.620 --> 04:31:31.060
 A broad smile cracked his face as he thought of Ryn's expression when she heard about this.

04:31:31.060 --> 04:31:35.860
 "That should do it," he said, slapping men on shoulders,

04:31:35.860 --> 04:31:38.100
 and the row of archers lowered their bows.

04:31:38.100 --> 04:31:41.220
 "Now what?" he'd done her asked.

04:31:41.220 --> 04:31:44.580
 "Now," we waited, CAMLON said.

04:31:44.580 --> 04:31:46.260
 "Shouldn't take long."

04:31:46.260 --> 04:31:49.300
 He was right. He didn't.

04:31:49.300 --> 04:31:54.020
 Soon enough, the palace said, handing closure were burning like a forest fire.

04:31:55.780 --> 04:32:00.260
 One desperate man leapt over the palace aid, apprehended immediately by a pandaatherin and his

04:32:00.260 --> 04:32:02.100
 men, followed shortly by others.

04:32:02.100 --> 04:32:07.540
 Soon after the gates creaked open, black clouds of smoke billowing out,

04:32:07.540 --> 04:32:11.140
 under huddle of men appeared, stumbling and coughing out onto the slope.

04:32:11.140 --> 04:32:17.460
 Some collapsed to the ground. Others stood with their arms raised in surrender as

04:32:17.460 --> 04:32:18.900
 Adanna's warriors closed in.

04:32:18.900 --> 04:32:22.660
 Pandaatherin heard the gathered prisoners down the slope.

04:32:24.340 --> 04:32:28.580
 Kamlin glanced at Adanna as she sighed and strode off towards the prisoners.

04:32:28.580 --> 04:32:31.220
 Kamlin and the others followed.

04:32:31.220 --> 04:32:35.620
 36 men were kneeling in the grass before Adanna.

04:32:35.620 --> 04:32:39.780
 They all wore the black and gold of Kamlin, Ryn's realm.

04:32:39.780 --> 04:32:42.820
 Adanna stood instead at them a long moment.

04:32:42.820 --> 04:32:46.180
 "How many of you are Ardenborn?" she asked.

04:32:46.180 --> 04:32:50.020
 Faces looked up at her, some nodding, others raising her hand.

04:32:50.980 --> 04:32:52.740
 28, Kamlin counted.

04:32:52.740 --> 04:32:57.780
 Narvan, Adanna asked, and thus stepped out from the warriors at her back.

04:32:57.780 --> 04:33:00.180
 Five raised their hands.

04:33:00.180 --> 04:33:03.060
 Drast narrowed his eyes instead at them.

04:33:03.060 --> 04:33:06.340
 Which three are from Kambran? Adanna asked.

04:33:06.340 --> 04:33:12.340
 Two raised their hands and Kamlin saw one other who was staring fixately at the grass of his knees.

04:33:12.340 --> 04:33:15.700
 "Bring them before me," Adanna said.

04:33:15.700 --> 04:33:21.940
 "And Halion, Baird, and Vaughn moved into the crowd, dragging the two who had raised their hands out of the group."

04:33:21.940 --> 04:33:26.580
 "That one," Kamlin said, pointing at the other one.

04:33:26.580 --> 04:33:29.860
 And he was dragged forwards too and thrown to the ground before Adanna.

04:33:29.860 --> 04:33:33.220
 "You are from Kambran," she said.

04:33:33.220 --> 04:33:38.580
 "You have come here to Arden with Ryn, invaded my country, killed my people."

04:33:38.580 --> 04:33:41.460
 There was a tremor of rage in her voice.

04:33:42.420 --> 04:33:46.660
 "You deserve death," Adanna said, "and I sentence you to execution."

04:33:46.660 --> 04:33:49.780
 Adanna approached the other prisoners.

04:33:49.780 --> 04:33:53.460
 "You others, you are Arden and Narvan born," she said.

04:33:53.460 --> 04:33:55.700
 "Men nodded eagerly," she frowned at them.

04:33:55.700 --> 04:34:02.180
 "And yet you wear the colors of Ryn, queen of Kambran, you have betrayed your country's served your enemy."

04:34:02.180 --> 04:34:06.740
 Kamlin saw fear ripple through them like wind through long grass.

04:34:06.740 --> 04:34:10.180
 "I will offer you my forgiveness."

04:34:11.540 --> 04:34:15.620
 Once, think more and one of them will need to change their riches.

04:34:15.620 --> 04:34:22.420
 "I will give you a choice, fight for me, for your countries, or go home."

04:34:22.420 --> 04:34:25.060
 Either way, you redeem yourselves.

04:34:25.060 --> 04:34:28.260
 She looked long and hard at their faces.

04:34:28.260 --> 04:34:35.300
 "If you go now, I shall not judge you, but if I see your faces again and your standing against me,

04:34:35.300 --> 04:34:41.140
 I'll see you die at death worthy of your betrayal. Make your choice," Adanna said.

04:34:42.020 --> 04:34:46.020
 And without waiting to see their reactions, she turned and strode away.

04:34:46.020 --> 04:34:49.620
 Only Kamlin saw the tears fill her eyes.

04:34:49.620 --> 04:34:56.980
 Kamlin sat with his back to a tree and watched more cats tower crumble in upon itself,

04:34:56.980 --> 04:35:00.500
 a great cloud of smoke and ash billowing up into the air.

04:35:00.500 --> 04:35:06.340
 He could see the bulk of Pendathrin as he led 50 men away to the east,

04:35:06.340 --> 04:35:07.940
 skirting the tree line of the woods.

04:35:09.220 --> 04:35:11.700
 Another group of men were waiting down there for dressed.

04:35:11.700 --> 04:35:14.820
 Going a separate ways for a while.

04:35:14.820 --> 04:35:19.220
 The plan was to split into three groups.

04:35:19.220 --> 04:35:22.900
 Then Dathrin, dressed, and Adanna, each leading a band of warriors,

04:35:22.900 --> 04:35:26.740
 the overall goal of each to make life an ardent, hard for Rin.

04:35:26.740 --> 04:35:32.660
 With a loud crash, the final section of more cats tower collapsed.

04:35:32.660 --> 04:35:38.900
 Kamlin grinned, wishing he could see more cats face when he marched out of the marshes to see it.

04:35:39.220 --> 04:35:45.780
 A pretty sight that tower calmed down, he commented as he leaned forwards into a skewer of

04:35:45.780 --> 04:35:48.340
 squirrel meat of the fire, tossing it to Meg.

04:35:48.340 --> 04:35:54.580
 She took the meat, blowing on her fingers and biting, grease dripping down her chin.

04:35:54.580 --> 04:36:00.420
 But after talking to her soon, he was surprised to find he felt sad about that.

04:36:00.420 --> 04:36:04.260
 Strange as it seems, she's not the worst company.

04:36:05.860 --> 04:36:09.940
 The drumbeats of hooves drew his eyes, and Kamlin watched a dozen riders

04:36:09.940 --> 04:36:13.780
 countering away in different directions, each with a large bag of silver taken from

04:36:13.780 --> 04:36:19.380
 more cats' chest, each one tasked with travelling through as many villages and holds as possible,

04:36:19.380 --> 04:36:23.460
 spreading the word of Adanna's victory at Dancrin that she was alive and well in

04:36:23.460 --> 04:36:25.220
 Arden and that she was fighting.

04:36:25.220 --> 04:36:30.100
 And of course, distributing a little silver to show that there was a bit of

04:36:30.100 --> 04:36:32.020
 profit to be had if you rode with Adanna.

04:36:33.620 --> 04:36:38.100
 We're moving forwards, closer to the end whether that be victory or death.

04:36:38.100 --> 04:36:43.860
 "We'll be leaving the marshes behind or soon," he said conversationally.

04:36:43.860 --> 04:36:46.900
 "I know that," Meg said, as if he was stupid.

04:36:46.900 --> 04:36:52.500
 "My'd be best for you if you and I made a trip to the next village along the marshes edge,

04:36:52.500 --> 04:36:54.580
 and I found a family to take you in."

04:36:54.580 --> 04:36:58.260
 Her head snapped round and she glided him, "No."

04:36:58.260 --> 04:37:03.460
 "This is your home, Meg," he said, with a jerk of his chin.

04:37:04.100 --> 04:37:10.420
 "The marshlands, these people, will be leaving here, going back to wooden forest."

04:37:10.420 --> 04:37:13.780
 "That's where my kind of fighting works best."

04:37:13.780 --> 04:37:18.500
 "We're going to war," he said, "and that's no place for you."

04:37:18.500 --> 04:37:20.580
 "You're eight summers old?"

04:37:20.580 --> 04:37:25.220
 "Walls here too," she said, looking at her feet.

04:37:25.220 --> 04:37:28.740
 "What do you call what happened to my village? My ma'am."

04:37:28.740 --> 04:37:31.300
 It was a tremor in our voice now.

04:37:32.580 --> 04:37:34.020
 He reached out and squeezed her hand.

04:37:34.020 --> 04:37:37.140
 She sucked in a deep breath, stuck her lip out.

04:37:37.140 --> 04:37:43.380
 "I thought about it already," she said. "Bad things happen everywhere. My village didn't

04:37:43.380 --> 04:37:46.020
 go marching off to war, but war still came and found them."

04:37:46.020 --> 04:37:49.780
 "You can leave me here, but who's to say, more can't?"

04:37:49.780 --> 04:37:54.420
 She paused at his name. Her sharp featured face twisting with hatred.

04:37:54.420 --> 04:37:57.380
 "Who's to say the same thing won't happen again?"

04:37:57.380 --> 04:37:59.140
 "War bands out there."

04:38:00.900 --> 04:38:04.180
 She waved angry at the marshes, staring at him defiantly.

04:38:04.180 --> 04:38:07.060
 "And you just leave me here and walk away."

04:38:07.060 --> 04:38:10.260
 "Well," didn't expect that.

04:38:10.260 --> 04:38:16.580
 "As for off the toes, but that's the most words you've put together since a metcher,"

04:38:16.580 --> 04:38:18.740
 Cameron said, blowing out a long breath.

04:38:18.740 --> 04:38:21.620
 "I like it here," she added.

04:38:21.620 --> 04:38:27.700
 Suddenly vulnerable, a child again, and besides, try and leave me here or anywhere.

04:38:27.700 --> 04:38:30.100
 I'll just give him the slip and follow you. Don't it before?

04:38:30.820 --> 04:38:32.100
 She grinned, mistuously.

04:38:32.100 --> 04:38:34.180
 Cameron sighed.

04:38:34.180 --> 04:38:38.100
 "Looks like you've thought it all through," she nodded.

04:38:38.100 --> 04:38:41.780
 "Well," seemed that settled then.

04:38:41.780 --> 04:38:48.420
 She gave him a long look, suspicious at first, which slowly changed to something resembling

04:38:48.420 --> 04:38:50.900
 pleased, and she went back to eating her squirrel.

04:38:50.900 --> 04:38:56.900
 He looked back to the tower, saw a black smudge swirl around the cloud of smoke,

04:38:56.900 --> 04:38:58.820
 and come flapping up the hill towards them.

04:38:59.780 --> 04:39:00.740
 "Is that crap?"

04:39:00.740 --> 04:39:05.700
 He felt a little jolt of relief and realized he'd been worried about the old crow.

04:39:05.700 --> 04:39:10.900
 The crows saw him and spiral down, starting cawing as it drew close,

04:39:10.900 --> 04:39:12.820
 and a lighted upon a branch over his head.

04:39:12.820 --> 04:39:16.100
 "Crap? Hungry?" it squawked.

04:39:16.100 --> 04:39:21.780
 BDI staring at the pile of skin, bone, and awful that had been a squirrel a short while ago.

04:39:21.780 --> 04:39:25.540
 "Help yourself," Cameron said with a wave of his hand.

04:39:25.540 --> 04:39:28.580
 "Don't think you usually asked," he added.

04:39:29.220 --> 04:39:33.220
 "When the crow had done, it hopped closer to Cameron."

04:39:33.220 --> 04:39:38.180
 "Well," Cameron asked, eager to hear the birds' news.

04:39:38.180 --> 04:39:39.540
 "It done, I!"

04:39:39.540 --> 04:39:41.060
 "Crap squawked."

04:39:41.060 --> 04:39:46.740
 "I, your lights," Cameron said, groaning at his stiff back as he stood.

04:39:46.740 --> 04:39:50.420
 Better off saying in news once, she's over there."

04:39:50.420 --> 04:39:55.220
 Cameron strode through white-spaced woodland towards Edana.

04:39:56.180 --> 04:39:59.860
 She had a few were about her now, just Halion, Vaughn, and Baird.

04:39:59.860 --> 04:40:03.380
 Nothing of her earlier emotion showed on her face.

04:40:03.380 --> 04:40:06.420
 She just looks tired, Cameron thought.

04:40:06.420 --> 04:40:13.700
 "Crap's back," Cameron announced, and the crow fluttered down onto the log Edana was sitting on.

04:40:13.700 --> 04:40:15.460
 "Your right?"

04:40:15.460 --> 04:40:22.340
 Cameron asked Edana, "My queen," he added, "after, earlier, the prisoners."

04:40:22.340 --> 04:40:25.780
 She passed her hand over her eyes and sighed.

04:40:26.740 --> 04:40:30.340
 "So much death," she said. "Who there ever be an end to it?"

04:40:30.340 --> 04:40:34.660
 "God, I believe there will be," Cameron shrugged.

04:40:34.660 --> 04:40:36.660
 "Called hope of being told."

04:40:36.660 --> 04:40:39.140
 He gave a lopsided grin.

04:40:39.140 --> 04:40:41.220
 "Long as he does an end with ours."

04:40:41.220 --> 04:40:43.060
 "Death, that is."

04:40:43.060 --> 04:40:46.900
 She smiled at that little snort of laughter.

04:40:46.900 --> 04:40:51.220
 "How many stayed?" he asked, referring to the prisoners.

04:40:52.180 --> 04:40:54.060
 "28," Halion said.

04:40:54.060 --> 04:40:55.860
 Cameron nodded.

04:40:55.860 --> 04:40:57.220
 "Shost them?"

04:40:57.220 --> 04:41:00.500
 "Not really," Edana admitted.

04:41:00.500 --> 04:41:04.420
 "But if I'm going to raise a war band more than half the men of art

04:41:04.420 --> 04:41:06.580
 and are probably wearing rins' colours right now,

04:41:06.580 --> 04:41:10.900
 I have to believe that it's against their will, that they'd rather fight for me."

04:41:10.900 --> 04:41:14.820
 "Think, that's most likely true enough."

04:41:14.820 --> 04:41:18.100
 "Always some rotten apples in the battle, though."

04:41:18.100 --> 04:41:20.500
 "I know," Edana said.

04:41:21.060 --> 04:41:22.100
 "But how do we root them out?"

04:41:22.100 --> 04:41:24.020
 "New recruits?"

04:41:24.020 --> 04:41:27.780
 "Put them at the front of the first battle and the second.

04:41:27.780 --> 04:41:30.420
 They'd implode themselves, risk dying for you."

04:41:30.420 --> 04:41:33.940
 "The Badans will most likely run first chance they get."

04:41:33.940 --> 04:41:39.380
 Baird grunted approvingly, and Edana nodded thoughtfully about.

04:41:39.380 --> 04:41:40.580
 "I'll do that," she said.

04:41:40.580 --> 04:41:43.620
 "Now, craft, what news have you for us?"

04:41:43.620 --> 04:41:46.020
 "Rin, had done grin!"

04:41:46.020 --> 04:41:47.140
 Craft said.

04:41:47.140 --> 04:41:49.300
 He paused and looked at them all.

04:41:49.300 --> 04:41:50.100
 "Very angry!"

04:41:50.100 --> 04:41:52.820
 Baird laughed at that.

04:41:52.820 --> 04:41:53.940
 "How many?"

04:41:53.940 --> 04:41:55.060
 Halleon asked.

04:41:55.060 --> 04:41:56.100
 "Lots?"

04:41:56.100 --> 04:41:56.980
 Craft muttered.

04:41:56.980 --> 04:41:58.020
 "Thousand?"

04:41:58.020 --> 04:41:59.060
 "Ten thousand?"

04:41:59.060 --> 04:42:00.580
 "And giants from Murias!"

04:42:00.580 --> 04:42:03.460
 Kamlin raised his eyebrows.

04:42:03.460 --> 04:42:07.620
 That explains the strange track to the meadow near Morgan's Tower.

04:42:07.620 --> 04:42:08.740
 "God war?"

04:42:08.740 --> 04:42:12.100
 Craft muttered, ruffling feathers with his beak.

04:42:12.100 --> 04:42:13.700
 "That again."

04:42:13.700 --> 04:42:16.660
 Vaughn tense the craft's words.

04:42:17.540 --> 04:42:20.100
 "It must be taken seriously," Vaughn said.

04:42:20.100 --> 04:42:25.220
 Vaughn had already spoken to Adana and Kamlin about this god war.

04:42:25.220 --> 04:42:29.620
 Told them about how he had stolen the giant's book from his father, Everness,

04:42:29.620 --> 04:42:33.940
 which had, in turn, been taken from him by Brenner during their flight to Darwin.

04:42:33.940 --> 04:42:37.300
 Kamlin and Adana had witnessed this.

04:42:37.300 --> 04:42:42.260
 But Vaughn also told them of a necklace hidden in Everness's Tower at Dunkarig.

04:42:42.260 --> 04:42:45.460
 An necklace with a black stone as a pendant.

04:42:47.220 --> 04:42:49.780
 "Ask craft what the seven treasures are," Vaughn had said.

04:42:49.780 --> 04:42:52.740
 "I don't need to ask craft," Adana had replied.

04:42:52.740 --> 04:42:54.820
 "I know the old tales as well as any."

04:42:54.820 --> 04:42:58.660
 "Cauldron and cup, spear, axe and dagger, talk and necklace."

04:42:58.660 --> 04:42:59.940
 "I."

04:42:59.940 --> 04:43:02.340
 "Necless," Vaughn had said.

04:43:02.340 --> 04:43:04.180
 "It makes sense."

04:43:04.180 --> 04:43:07.620
 "Dunkarig, fortress of the Minofe, Namarne their queen."

04:43:07.620 --> 04:43:10.820
 "So, what if you're right?"

04:43:10.820 --> 04:43:12.500
 Kamlin had asked.

04:43:12.500 --> 04:43:15.860
 "If one of the seven treasures is in Dunkarig,

04:43:15.860 --> 04:43:17.540
 then we must do something about it."

04:43:17.540 --> 04:43:22.580
 "Craft keeps squawking about the godwall, a prophecy about Corbyn and the bright star

04:43:22.580 --> 04:43:24.660
 and black sun, about the seven treasures."

04:43:24.660 --> 04:43:29.220
 "It all sounds right strange to me," Kamlin had said.

04:43:29.220 --> 04:43:33.860
 "I," Me too, Vaughn had agreed, but you're not understanding.

04:43:33.860 --> 04:43:39.620
 If craft is right, if this godwall is happening, then what is happening here in Ireland is just a

04:43:39.620 --> 04:43:40.740
 pebble in the ocean.

04:43:40.740 --> 04:43:44.340
 If this is true, then we must help."

04:43:45.700 --> 04:43:46.740
 "How would we help?"

04:43:46.740 --> 04:43:47.620
 he'd done her had asked.

04:43:47.620 --> 04:43:51.220
 "We must go and get the necklace and take it to Corbyn in Drassel."

04:43:51.220 --> 04:43:54.660
 He'd done her had just stared at Vaughn.

04:43:54.660 --> 04:43:57.140
 Kamlin hadn't been sure as she thought he was mad.

04:43:57.140 --> 04:44:02.180
 "I'll think on it," was all that she had said, and then left.

04:44:02.180 --> 04:44:06.180
 "I am taking seriously," he'd done a set of Vaughn.

04:44:06.180 --> 04:44:09.220
 "Then, what will be done about it?"

04:44:09.220 --> 04:44:11.300
 "The godwall, the necklace," Vaughn pressed.

04:44:11.940 --> 04:44:18.340
 "I am going to retake Arden," he'd done a set slowly, or die in the trying.

04:44:18.340 --> 04:44:25.700
 "If, by some stroke of good fortune, I am victorious and Rin is slain or sent back to Cameron,

04:44:25.700 --> 04:44:32.260
 then I will gladly tear Ebnes' tower down, stone by stone, until this necklace is found,

04:44:32.260 --> 04:44:34.580
 and I will personally take it to Corbyn in Drassel."

04:44:34.580 --> 04:44:41.060
 But until then, I must concentrate on what is in front of me, Arden and Rin first.

04:44:41.940 --> 04:44:43.460
 Rong!" Kraft said.

04:44:43.460 --> 04:44:45.300
 "I like that bird."

04:44:45.300 --> 04:44:48.740
 Bear chuckled. "He's got stones, speaks his mind."

04:44:48.740 --> 04:44:53.140
 "Well, a good counselor does, I suppose," Adanna said.

04:44:53.140 --> 04:44:59.140
 "But they also know when to stop and not labour a point," she added, with one eyebrow raised.

04:44:59.140 --> 04:45:04.580
 "I have listened, weighed the choices and I have made my decision, but," Vaughn began.

04:45:04.580 --> 04:45:09.540
 "No," Adanna said, her voice rising. "Enough, Vaughn."

04:45:10.420 --> 04:45:16.260
 "Von," scowled at her a long moment, jaw working as he struggled with the words itching

04:45:16.260 --> 04:45:20.500
 to get out of his mouth, and then he clamped his jaw shut, and nodded.

04:45:20.500 --> 04:45:27.300
 CHAPTER XXI

04:45:27.300 --> 04:45:33.220
 Halen stared at Cohen as moonlight silvered her face.

04:45:33.220 --> 04:45:38.180
 He was terrified being out as he had grown so accustomed to hiding,

04:45:38.180 --> 04:45:42.820
 but Budai had been uncontrollable after he got a sniff of pots, snapping his leash and heading

04:45:42.820 --> 04:45:45.460
 off into the darkness, and pots had run with him.

04:45:45.460 --> 04:45:52.660
 For one elongated moment, Halen had watched them go, then he'd been scrambling after them,

04:45:52.660 --> 04:45:56.260
 cursing them both the entire time, it had taken him to catch up with Budai and wrapped

04:45:56.260 --> 04:45:58.260
 the remains of the torn leash about his arm.

04:45:58.260 --> 04:46:02.820
 Budai had calmed for a while when they reached his courtyard.

04:46:03.540 --> 04:46:08.580
 Maybe the sounds of guardsmen and the crackling fire reminded him that death lurked around

04:46:08.580 --> 04:46:13.620
 every corner in this place. That wasn't till the figure had appeared at the window.

04:46:13.620 --> 04:46:18.420
 Budai had taken a few deep sniffs through his broad muzzle,

04:46:18.420 --> 04:46:23.060
 wind, and then he was off again. Halen standing no chance of even slowing him,

04:46:23.060 --> 04:46:23.940
 let alone stopping him.

04:46:23.940 --> 04:46:27.620
 Halen, what are you doing here?

04:46:28.260 --> 04:46:32.740
 Cohen whispered. Chasing the dogs, he whispered back,

04:46:32.740 --> 04:46:36.820
 eyes flitting between Cohen and the fire light flickering at the building's corner.

04:46:36.820 --> 04:46:41.060
 Cohen smiled, ruffling Budai's fur.

04:46:41.060 --> 04:46:48.820
 "I mean, how are you still alive? Where are you hiding? Are you alone? How do you have

04:46:48.820 --> 04:46:53.220
 Budai with you?" She took a breath clearly framing more questions.

04:46:53.220 --> 04:46:56.100
 "It's not safe here," Halen said. "Come with me."

04:46:57.380 --> 04:47:02.340
 He went to move away but Cohen gripped his wrist. "I'll tell you everything, I promise," he said.

04:47:02.340 --> 04:47:07.860
 He looked up, the open sky, moon, and stars feeling like it went on forever.

04:47:07.860 --> 04:47:09.060
 He shadowed.

04:47:09.060 --> 04:47:14.420
 Cohen stared at him and nodded. "Follow me," he whispered and ran.

04:47:14.420 --> 04:47:20.100
 They passed through wide streets, always keeping to the edges, to the shadows.

04:47:20.100 --> 04:47:24.340
 Soon they were entering a courtyard with an old oak at its centre,

04:47:24.340 --> 04:47:28.180
 his trunk wide and thick roots churning up the flagstone floor.

04:47:28.180 --> 04:47:31.620
 Halen headed to a deeper shadow in its midst.

04:47:31.620 --> 04:47:36.820
 And then he was scrambling into it, climbing into the hole that led to his den,

04:47:36.820 --> 04:47:42.020
 his sense of safety grew palpably with each step deeper into his underground hiding place.

04:47:42.020 --> 04:47:48.820
 "This way," Halen whispered, as they slithered down a slope about the length of a man

04:47:48.820 --> 04:47:51.300
 and reached the spot where you could turn left or right.

04:47:52.420 --> 04:47:56.900
 The familiar stench from the left drifted up to him but by now Halen hardly noticed.

04:47:56.900 --> 04:48:01.780
 Cohen clearly did, though, wrinkling her nose and inputting a hand over her mouth.

04:48:01.780 --> 04:48:05.220
 "That's disgusting," she whispered.

04:48:05.220 --> 04:48:07.620
 Halen grunted and turned right.

04:48:07.620 --> 04:48:14.020
 They shuffled along a dark, narrowing space, forced onto hands and knees as the tunnel they were

04:48:14.020 --> 04:48:19.460
 in followed a twisting root, then Halen heard a welcoming wine and saw a flicker of light.

04:48:20.100 --> 04:48:24.900
 He smiled. A space opened up before him wide enough for about

04:48:24.900 --> 04:48:27.860
 six men to stand abreast and about a dozen paces long.

04:48:27.860 --> 04:48:34.340
 Beyond that, the tunnel narrowed again, twisting off about the root it followed.

04:48:34.340 --> 04:48:39.620
 The small chamber was lit by a bowl of oil on a knot in the thick root,

04:48:39.620 --> 04:48:41.380
 flame dancing upon its surface.

04:48:41.380 --> 04:48:48.900
 Too fate is greeted him, swaying and sift, wolf, sun and daughter, and six bundles of fur,

04:48:48.900 --> 04:48:52.820
 boot eyes and storms cubs bouncing and leaping in their excitement at his return.

04:48:52.820 --> 04:48:57.220
 Seeing them like this, he realized how they'd grown.

04:48:57.220 --> 04:49:03.140
 They were only five or six moons old, but already they were all taller than pots,

04:49:03.140 --> 04:49:07.140
 their necks and broad chests thickening with muscle, like boot-eye.

04:49:07.140 --> 04:49:12.100
 They're not grow as big a storm but big enough and they'll be wide and strong, I don't doubt.

04:49:12.100 --> 04:49:17.620
 Calm down!" sift scolded the cubs as they bounced into her.

04:49:18.580 --> 04:49:22.020
 "She was on her hands and knees playing with her bag of stones and nuts,

04:49:22.020 --> 04:49:26.020
 rolling them into each other. Some of them sift for chalked white.

04:49:26.020 --> 04:49:30.500
 I still don't understand that game, but it's kept sift quiet for over a moon."

04:49:30.500 --> 04:49:35.460
 Boot-eye and pots burst into the chamber, making the cubs even more excited.

04:49:35.460 --> 04:49:41.700
 One of them froze, black-faced and brindle-coated, and stared at the darkness of the tunnel.

04:49:41.700 --> 04:49:45.620
 It growled, revealing a row of razor-sharp puppy teeth.

04:49:46.900 --> 04:49:52.100
 "Shado," Halen said, reaching out to hand to the cub, but she didn't stop growling.

04:49:52.100 --> 04:49:57.620
 The other cubs stopped their frolicking and stared too, cocking heads,

04:49:57.620 --> 04:50:00.260
 and then they were all growling as Cohen emerged from the darkness.

04:50:00.260 --> 04:50:05.860
 "Shado," the black-faced cub, took a snarling step forward,

04:50:05.860 --> 04:50:10.660
 legs bunching about to leap, the others moving tight about her all growling hackles up.

04:50:10.660 --> 04:50:16.820
 Halen felt a real moment of panic, snapping a command at them that was completely

04:50:16.820 --> 04:50:22.980
 ignored. Then Boot-eye was standing between the cubs and Cohen, bearing his teeth, daring them.

04:50:22.980 --> 04:50:28.100
 The cubs stopped, tails dropping, submitting.

04:50:28.100 --> 04:50:32.580
 "Shado" gave her last little growler protest, and then she too was quiet.

04:50:32.580 --> 04:50:34.100
 "Thank Alion."

04:50:34.100 --> 04:50:37.780
 "I thought they were going to attack me," Cohen said.

04:50:37.780 --> 04:50:41.300
 Looking relieved as she stroked Boot-eye's broad head.

04:50:41.300 --> 04:50:46.500
 Then she threw her head back and laughed, long and sounding slightly mad.

04:50:47.460 --> 04:50:51.700
 "I can't believe you're all here," Cohen said, sitting down and cuddling Boot-eye.

04:50:51.700 --> 04:50:56.500
 Potts put his four legs on Cohen's shoulder and licked one of her ears,

04:50:56.500 --> 04:50:58.820
 the cub was tentatively approached her, sniffing.

04:50:58.820 --> 04:51:04.900
 Cohen held her arms out and beckoned to Sif, who walked over and hesitantly allowed Cohen to hug her.

04:51:04.900 --> 04:51:11.940
 After about a count of ten, Sif was sitting in Cohen's lap, hugging her tightly in return.

04:51:11.940 --> 04:51:14.020
 "How was this happened?"

04:51:14.740 --> 04:51:15.780
 Cohen asked.

04:51:15.780 --> 04:51:19.220
 "The battle," Swain started.

04:51:19.220 --> 04:51:21.380
 "When it happened, we were here with the cubs."

04:51:21.380 --> 04:51:26.500
 "Because Corbyn had asked us to look after them," Sif said with a big serial size.

04:51:26.500 --> 04:51:29.780
 "He did, I remember," Cohen agreed.

04:51:29.780 --> 04:51:32.900
 "We didn't know what to do," Swain continued.

04:51:32.900 --> 04:51:37.940
 I was terrified, Halen thought, remembering the distant dinner battle, the screams,

04:51:37.940 --> 04:51:39.780
 and battle cries, flames smoke.

04:51:39.780 --> 04:51:43.220
 He'd been in the courtyard a bar playing tug with Shado.

04:51:44.260 --> 04:51:48.180
 She'd heard it first, stopping and staring, ears going flat to her head.

04:51:48.180 --> 04:51:52.500
 Boot-eye was here with the cubs, Swain continued.

04:51:52.500 --> 04:51:56.660
 But he ran off when the fighting started, and then all the cubs were off as well following him.

04:51:56.660 --> 04:51:59.620
 We chased them, and then a man appeared in front of us.

04:51:59.620 --> 04:52:04.580
 "He had rings in his beard," Sif said.

04:52:04.580 --> 04:52:06.740
 "I," Swain said.

04:52:06.740 --> 04:52:08.420
 Eyes distant, remembering.

04:52:08.420 --> 04:52:11.140
 He was going to kill us, tried to, but Boot-eye killed him.

04:52:11.700 --> 04:52:15.540
 Ripped his throat out," Sif added, matter of factly.

04:52:15.540 --> 04:52:20.340
 We picked up all the cubs between us and tricked Boot-eye into following us back here.

04:52:20.340 --> 04:52:23.860
 "How did you manage that?" Cohen asked.

04:52:23.860 --> 04:52:26.100
 "They were silent a few moments."

04:52:26.100 --> 04:52:32.500
 "I pinched one of the cubs, twisted her ear and made her cry," Halen said.

04:52:32.500 --> 04:52:34.500
 "He still felt guilty about that."

04:52:34.500 --> 04:52:37.540
 Boot-eye followed us back here, and then we tied him up.

04:52:38.500 --> 04:52:41.300
 "We were scared he'd get killed," Sif said.

04:52:41.300 --> 04:52:44.420
 "You were right to do it," Cohen said.

04:52:44.420 --> 04:52:46.580
 "Stroking Sif's hair."

04:52:46.580 --> 04:52:48.340
 Boot-eye would have been killed.

04:52:48.340 --> 04:52:50.420
 "I think you saved his life."

04:52:50.420 --> 04:52:53.140
 Sif smiled at nodding.

04:52:53.140 --> 04:52:58.900
 By now all six cubs were rubbing up against Cohen, sniffing, nibbling her clothing.

04:52:58.900 --> 04:53:01.780
 One was tugging at her hair, and she absolutely pushed it off.

04:53:03.300 --> 04:53:07.300
 And since then, Sway went on, we've just stayed hidden.

04:53:07.300 --> 04:53:11.460
 Every now and then, me or Halen sneak out for food and water,

04:53:11.460 --> 04:53:16.020
 Potsie's good at foraging for the cubs, he's always disappearing and coming back with something for them."

04:53:16.020 --> 04:53:21.060
 Sif screwed her face up at that, and Halen remembered some of the things Potsie returned with,

04:53:21.060 --> 04:53:22.660
 an arm once.

04:53:22.660 --> 04:53:24.740
 The cubs hadn't complained.

04:53:24.740 --> 04:53:27.060
 "What's happening?"

04:53:27.060 --> 04:53:28.260
 "Up there?"

04:53:28.260 --> 04:53:30.180
 Swayen asked Cohen.

04:53:30.180 --> 04:53:33.060
 "I'm a prisoner," Cohen said.

04:53:33.060 --> 04:53:35.940
 "I tend to the sick, wounded from the battle.

04:53:35.940 --> 04:53:40.660
 Most have recovered or died, but there are still a few to tend to."

04:53:40.660 --> 04:53:44.660
 "I meant Corbyn," Swayen said.

04:53:44.660 --> 04:53:45.140
 "And are?"

04:53:45.140 --> 04:53:52.180
 "Well, I think you escaped," Cohen said, and Swayen and Sif physically drooped with relief.

04:53:52.180 --> 04:53:56.740
 "To hear, what am I shielding and my friend?"

04:53:56.740 --> 04:54:02.500
 To hear had driven Halen mad, with his strict rules about where Halen could and couldn't go,

04:54:02.500 --> 04:54:06.340
 what he couldn't couldn't do, and his man's old sayings.

04:54:06.340 --> 04:54:09.780
 "I wish I could see him and hear one of those sayings now."

04:54:09.780 --> 04:54:12.660
 "To hear?"

04:54:12.660 --> 04:54:13.140
 He asked.

04:54:13.140 --> 04:54:16.820
 "You're a sheildman, I don't know," Cohen shrugged.

04:54:16.820 --> 04:54:18.660
 "There was a lot of confusion.

04:54:18.660 --> 04:54:23.540
 Many escaped," she said, hopefully, and there in foreign, still fighting.

04:54:23.540 --> 04:54:27.540
 "How do you know if you're a prisoner?"

04:54:28.500 --> 04:54:33.380
 Halen asked suspiciously. He wanted good news, but he didn't want to be lied to, treated

04:54:33.380 --> 04:54:33.940
 like a child.

04:54:33.940 --> 04:54:38.260
 "A patrol of Vinthalen came back this morning. I saw them.

04:54:38.260 --> 04:54:41.300
 They were more dead and wounded than the living amongst them."

04:54:41.300 --> 04:54:44.260
 "Huh," Swayen barked a laugh.

04:54:44.260 --> 04:54:47.620
 "My dars worked for sure," no doubt, Cohen said.

04:54:47.620 --> 04:54:49.700
 "So, what now?"

04:54:49.700 --> 04:54:53.860
 Halen asked. "You could stay with us," Sif said.

04:54:53.860 --> 04:54:57.380
 "I wish I could," Cohen replied, "but I can't."

04:54:58.020 --> 04:55:00.100
 "I tend to sick and cannot abandon them."

04:55:00.100 --> 04:55:07.140
 "The sides, if Caled has found me gone, he'd tear Drassel apart looking for me. He might find you."

04:55:07.140 --> 04:55:09.380
 "Why would he do that?"

04:55:09.380 --> 04:55:15.540
 Sif asked. "Because I am Corbin's kin, and he thinks Corbin will come for me.

04:55:15.540 --> 04:55:17.700
 I am bait and a trap."

04:55:17.700 --> 04:55:20.100
 "Will Corbin come?"

04:55:20.100 --> 04:55:22.740
 Halen, Swayen, and Sif asked together.

04:55:22.740 --> 04:55:25.780
 "I don't know," Cohen shook her head.

04:55:26.740 --> 04:55:29.620
 "He did the last time when I was Caledus' prisoner.

04:55:29.620 --> 04:55:33.460
 But if it's a trap," Halen said.

04:55:33.460 --> 04:55:36.900
 "Then Corbin cannot come. He is our hope."

04:55:36.900 --> 04:55:43.620
 Halen loved Corbin, admired him as the greatest warrior and leader the world had ever seen.

04:55:43.620 --> 04:55:49.060
 "Then you have to escape. Get out of here before Corbin comes for you."

04:55:49.060 --> 04:55:54.660
 A smile twitched Corbin's mouth, not light-hearted but serious and determined.

04:55:55.540 --> 04:55:59.700
 "My thoughts exactly," she said. "It's just a how that I'm struggling with.

04:55:59.700 --> 04:56:01.700
 And now that I know you're here,"

04:56:01.700 --> 04:56:07.380
 she smiled. "You'll have to come with me, as Caledus may find you in his search for me."

04:56:07.380 --> 04:56:10.740
 That thought both excited and scared Halen.

04:56:10.740 --> 04:56:15.460
 To be away from this danger, the daily fear of being discovered in court,

04:56:15.460 --> 04:56:20.020
 but being away from our den, which has kept us safe and hidden a whole moon.

04:56:21.940 --> 04:56:27.540
 "And, talking of being discovered, I should go back to the hospice as the sun will be rising."

04:56:27.540 --> 04:56:32.500
 Sif squeezed her harder and Cohen squeezed her in return.

04:56:32.500 --> 04:56:39.460
 "I cannot tell you how happy I am to know that you're alive in here," Coen said.

04:56:39.460 --> 04:56:40.260
 "And my boot I?"

04:56:40.260 --> 04:56:43.140
 She hugged the hound's neck, kissing him.

04:56:43.140 --> 04:56:47.860
 "I'll return soon," she said, then made her goodbyes,

04:56:47.860 --> 04:56:50.100
 ruffling the cubs' heads and hugging Sif again.

04:56:51.460 --> 04:56:55.140
 She gave boot I a stern order to stay and then backed into the darkness of the tunnel.

04:56:55.140 --> 04:56:59.380
 Boot I wind, but he did not follow her.

04:56:59.380 --> 04:57:04.340
 Halen did, though, and soon they were at the slope that led up to the courtyard.

04:57:04.340 --> 04:57:06.420
 Moonlight showed them the way.

04:57:06.420 --> 04:57:13.460
 "That's smell," Cohen said, wrinkling her nose of these stood in the darkness at the base of the

04:57:13.460 --> 04:57:18.020
 slope. She was staring into the darkness of the tunnel where the smell was drifting from.

04:57:19.140 --> 04:57:22.740
 "I recognize it," she said quietly, her expression changing.

04:57:22.740 --> 04:57:24.660
 She looked scared.

04:57:24.660 --> 04:57:27.700
 "Is that another tunnel?" she asked him.

04:57:27.700 --> 04:57:32.580
 "It is," he said, remembering the first time he'd found this place,

04:57:32.580 --> 04:57:35.540
 how he'd crawled that way first, eventually stopping and coming back.

04:57:35.540 --> 04:57:40.500
 It gets too narrow. Strangely, the cubs never went that way.

04:57:40.500 --> 04:57:44.660
 "Good," Coen said, her expression relaxing.

04:57:45.940 --> 04:57:51.860
 "Why?" "Because I know that smell, and I think there are dregs down there."

04:57:51.860 --> 04:57:56.980
 Chapter 22

04:57:56.980 --> 04:57:58.660
 Corbin

04:57:58.660 --> 04:58:06.980
 Corbin sat upon a giant bear, hands gripping the high palm of a saddle as it shambled along

04:58:06.980 --> 04:58:11.140
 a fresh-built road that cut like a spear through the trees and undergrowth of form.

04:58:12.580 --> 04:58:17.220
 Jail's road, which he built almost from the boundaries of Graham's hold to see him in his war band

04:58:17.220 --> 04:58:24.580
 to the walls of Jassel. The bear's pace was surprisingly fast, eating up the leagues at a relentless

04:58:24.580 --> 04:58:30.660
 pace throughout each day's travel. His legs were aching, the girth of a bear was unsuitable for

04:58:30.660 --> 04:58:35.620
 his human legs. "I miss shield," he thought. "Not for the first time."

04:58:35.620 --> 04:58:42.340
 The trees were thinning now, the terrain changing and more sunlight breaking through the canopy

04:58:42.340 --> 04:58:47.620
 above. There was less vine and thorn on the ground, more grass and wildflowers.

04:58:47.620 --> 04:58:53.700
 And then, Corbin saw the stumps of trees, a whole veil harvested of timber.

04:58:53.700 --> 04:59:02.020
 We are close to Graham's hold. With every league that he had travelled, every day that had passed,

04:59:02.020 --> 04:59:07.540
 he had felt his spirit sink. After Michael's revelation about the prophecy,

04:59:07.540 --> 04:59:12.260
 Corbin had been in the deepest depths of despair, but focusing on the hope of

04:59:12.260 --> 04:59:16.420
 being reunited with Coen and his friends had given him the strength to endure.

04:59:16.420 --> 04:59:19.700
 It had been something to live for, to fight for.

04:59:19.700 --> 04:59:26.740
 Now he knew that, with every breath that he drew, he was being taken further away from them,

04:59:26.740 --> 04:59:30.260
 if they still lived, and despondency had morphed into anger.

04:59:30.260 --> 04:59:39.220
 Hated faces appeared in his mind, Caledas, Nefair, Ealdair, Rin, Michael.

04:59:40.820 --> 04:59:45.700
 He had thought about escape, but the simple truth was that even if he could somehow break

04:59:45.700 --> 04:59:49.940
 his bonds and slip away from his giant captors, he would not have been able to walk half

04:59:49.940 --> 04:59:56.100
 the league because of his injuries. Even now, over a moon from when he'd been captured,

04:59:56.100 --> 05:00:00.180
 they were still not fully recovered. Soon, no, perhaps.

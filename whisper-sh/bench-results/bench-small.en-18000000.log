[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.340]   ROTH. Book Four of the Faithful and the Fallen by John Gwynn, read by Damian Lynch.
[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:15.140]   ROTH and Vengeance Pored. John Milton. Paradise Lost.
[00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.380]   Chapter One. There it is.
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:27.300]   The year 1144 of the Age of Exiles, Hound Moon.
[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.580]   There it is, fell through the night air, weightless. He caught glimpses of the Tower
[00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.540]   of Brickhan, Caledas's still smoldering outline at the window, then below, the river coming up
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.940]   to meet him. He slammed into the water, the cold shocking the breath out of him. He panicked,
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.300]   disorientated, realising he didn't know which way was up. All about him was darkness and ice.
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.780]   Then something grabbed his hair, and he was surging upwards, breaking through the water
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.860]   in a burst of spray, and saw Alcion's pale broad face staring back at him.
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.460]   "They will come hunting for us," the giant shouted over the roar of the river,
[00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.220]   as the current gripped them, sweeping them away from the thunder of warriors feet crossing the
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:24.260]   bridge. "Let the water take us far from them." Veridos saw the sense of that, though his hands and
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.100]   feet were already numbing from the cold. He put some effort into swimming, speeding his
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.060]   way from Brickhan, from Caledas, from the Kadashim. The thought still jolted him like a blow.
[00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.460]   They turned a bend in the river, and the fortress was gone, darkness enfolding them.
[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.420]   The soft, weak sheen of Dorn's grey light filtered down through the lattice of branches above,
[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.820]   as Veridos met Alcion's gaze, an unspoken agreement passing between them,
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.940]   as they both headed for the riverbank. It was harder going, swimming across the current,
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.780]   and Veridos realised how exhausted his body was, but eventually he felt silt beneath his feet,
[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.060]   his hands grasping at Reeds as he pulled himself out of the water and flopped onto his back,
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:22.100]   gasping, his limbs feeling lead-filled. Turning, he saw Alcion on the bank, thirty of forty paces up
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.860]   river from him, staggering wearily towards him before he slumped down beside him with a grown,
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.980]   water dripping from his drooping moustache. "Thank you," Alcion said. "For what?"
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.420]   "Everything. Most of all for helping my family escape Brickhan's dungeons."
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.660]   His wife and bairn. "How long has he gone without seeing them?"
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.340]   "And what must he have suffered, knowing they were Calidus and Lycus' prisoners?"
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:01.180]   "And for destroying Calidus' effigy of me," Alcion continued. "You have set me free."
[00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:10.740]   He gave a shudder, followed by a smile. "A shadow is gone from my soul. I feel reborn.
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.460]   If you mean you feel weak as a newborn bairn," Veredis muttered as he emptied his boot of water
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.300]   and tried to pull it back on, "then I feel the same."
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:27.100]   "That is not what I mean," the giant rumbled, regarding Veredis with serious eyes.
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:37.460]   "You set Reiner and Tain free. You set me free. I owe you a debt beyond all imagining."
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:44.580]   "You're in no debt to me," Veredis said. "I kicked the effigies into the fire on impulse,
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.460]   not really knowing what they were or what power they held over you."
[00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.060]   "But you suspected?" "Aye."
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.060]   "Something that Fidele said."
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.140]   He thought of Nathair's mother, hoped that she had made it to freedom along with his brother,
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:09.540]   Krellus, McKean and Albin. "And your wife and son, I set them free because it was the right thing to
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:21.100]   do. There was no other choice." "Ah, but there was, true heart, there always is," Veredis shrugged.
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:29.140]   "There is no debt between us. You are my friend." "One of my only friends," it has turned out.
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:35.460]   His thoughts swept bitterly to Nathair and the confession and revelations that had stunned
[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:43.500]   Veredis. He remembered Caledus's confession, that Nathair had slain Aquilis, his own father.
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:52.860]   Anger and shame twisted through him. There had been so many signs. How can I have been
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:02.860]   deceived for so long? I am a fool." "How long?" Veredis asked him. "How long have you been Caledus's
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:15.700]   prisoner?" Alcian's smile withered. "Sixteen years." "That is a long time." "It is," Alcian
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:24.100]   clenched his fists, knuckles cracking. "I should have killed him." "To be fair, we both tried hard
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.700]   on that count. I put a knife in his belly, threw him in a fire, and he shattered his chest with a
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:40.620]   war hammer." "Kadashim are hard to kill." "I'd have to agree. Can he be killed?" "Maybe taking his head.
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:50.340]   That is how the others are slain." "Others?" "The Jihah, they are demon possessed by Kadashim,
[00:05:50.340 --> 00:06:00.140]   at Murias," Alcian said to the question in Veredis's eyes. "The Jihah," Veredis muttered,
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:07.780]   shaking his head, "have been so blind." "You trusted your king and your friend,"
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:18.220]   Alcian shrugged. "There are worse failings to have." "Are there?" "I have dedicated my life to
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:27.540]   a lie." "They both sat in silence, water dripping from clothes and hair." "What now?" Veredis said
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.700]   to himself. "It feels as if my whole life has been dedicated to an affair in his cause."
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:42.300]   "What do I do now?" Alcian regarded him gravely, then poked his chest with a thick finger. "What
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:51.300]   does your heart tell you?" "I will not trust it." "Look what has led me thus far," Veredis said
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:59.860]   sourly. "Your eyes are open now." Veredis sucked in a deep breath, felt exhaustion seeping through
[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:11.580]   him. "What would you do?" he asked the giant. "Find my kin, my Reina and Tane." He smiled as he
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:20.540]   said their names. "Kin? My father is slain, as is my brother Ektor. Only Krellus is left."
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:29.700]   Suddenly, he was desperate to see his older brother. "Find our kin," he echoed. "A good place
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:36.760]   to start." Something squawked, a handful of wood pigeons suddenly bursting from the trees and
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:45.380]   flapping noisily overhead. "We should move." "We need cover." "Aye, to the trees," Veredis said as he
[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:50.700]   stood suppressing a groan. They were halfway across the clearing when Alcian stopped abruptly,
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:57.980]   staring back along the riverbank. Forms appeared around a distant bend on the track, shadows in
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:03.820]   the half-light that Fawn's canopy created, black shadows with curved swords sheathed across their
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:12.860]   backs. "Kadoshim," Alcian growled. Veredis counted at least seven of them, moving quickly, a loping,
[00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:18.500]   ground-eating paste like a pack of wolfen. They were spread in a half-circle between the riverbank
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:25.420]   and the tree-line. "They are hunting us, have been running all night long following the river in
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:33.860]   search of our trail." One of the figures paused, the others rippling to a halt about it. It lifted
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:40.540]   its head as if tasting the air, then gave an ululating howl and leapt forwards a new energy
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:50.580]   in its stride. "They've caught our scent." Veredis felt a jolt of fear. He'd faced giants, dregs,
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:55.820]   warbands. But somehow, knowing that the demons of the other world were hunting him, sent a cold
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:06.620]   shock of fear tingling through his veins. "Kadoshim," Calidis's kin, "my enemy." Calidis
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:11.980]   filled his mind, an image of the man he had thought counsellor and ally emerging from the fire in
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:19.940]   Brican's tower, flame-reathed and snarling. "He has corrupted Nathair and has deceived me for so long.
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:28.620]   He is the author of this evil." Fear morphed into a cold rage and he reached for his sword, lips
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:37.460]   twisting. "Move!" Altian grunted and broke into a run. Veredis resisted for a moment, inexplicably
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.740]   wanting to stand and fight these creatures, but Altian dragged him along and, in a heartbeat
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:48.940]   they were only a few strides from the tree-line. He realised the giant had no weapon, no war hammer
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:54.780]   or battle axe strapped across his back, no sword or dagger at his hip. They crashed through the
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:10:00.060]   first layer of undergrowth and were immediately enveloped by a twilight world of shadow and thorn.
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:08.420]   Altian forged ahead, grunting as branches snapped upon his rock-like torso, thorns whipping at
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:15.220]   Veredis, vines tangling about his boots. For what seemed a long time, Veredis only heard
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:20.820]   his own heart thumping, the rasp of his breath, the thud of Altian's feet. Then there were sounds
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:26.420]   behind him, faint at first, like the rustle of wind through foliage, but soon louder,
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:33.460]   keening cries were floating about him. They splashed through a stream, something sinuous
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:40.340]   and slithered beneath Veredis' feet, making him stumble. "They are almost upon us," he gasped to
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:47.780]   Altian. "Better to turn and fight, hold a sword in my fist than die running." "I know," the giant said,
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:54.740]   turning, chest heaving. Veredis drew his sword as they put their backs to a huge tree, the stream
[00:10:54.740 --> 00:11:01.740]   before them, and waited. Forms flitted through the gloom, emerging from a curtain of shadows and thick
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:09.100]   foliage. One was a long way ahead of the others, clothed in the dark mail of the Jihar, pale-skinned,
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:16.740]   dark veins making a tapestry of its flesh. It saw them and leapt the stream, arms reaching for
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:24.260]   Veredis, not even bothering to draw its sword. "Remember, you must take their heads," Altian
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:29.220]   grunted, as he pushed away from the tree, hurling himself into the oncoming kaddashim with bone
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:37.020]   crushing power. The two fell to the ground. Veredis hurtled forwards, sword raised, hacking two-handed
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:42.740]   at the kaddashim's arm, its hand spinning away, blood like oil pumping languidly from the stump.
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:49.180]   Then the two forms were rolling together again. Altian growled in pain, then he was on his knees,
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:55.540]   arms wrapped about the kaddashim's torso, pinning its arms at its side. The creature's head writhed,
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:00.880]   veins bulging as it strained to break free, Altian's face turning purple with the effort,
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:09.020]   his locked fingers slowly pulling apart. "What are you waiting for?" the giant rasped,
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:15.540]   and Veredis swung his sword, chopping into the creature's neck. Dark blood spurted from the
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:20.860]   half-severed neck, the kaddashim screeching with fury, Altian roared with the strain of holding
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:28.140]   the creature. Veredis wrenched his sword free and swung again. The kaddashim's head flew through
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:35.500]   the air landing with a splash in the stream. Its body slumped, legs drumming as Altian fell away
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:43.460]   and rolled clear. A black, icor-like mist flowed from the kaddashim's neck, hissing and swirling,
[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:49.220]   gathering above its body, forming a human shape with tattered wings of smoke spread about it,
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:57.980]   and red eyes glowing like coals at its heart. Veredis stared, frozen. It screamed savagely,
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:05.060]   then it was melting away, torn and dispersed by a slight breeze. "What the hell?" Veredis gasped.
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:11.900]   "Down!" Altian yelled as he surged up from the ground, a fist slamming into the jaw of a leaping
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:19.100]   kaddashim, hurling it spinning into the undergrowth. Almost as soon as it hit the ground, it was back
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:26.140]   on its feet, twisting like a feral cat. Veredis hefted his sword, spread his legs to meet the
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:30.980]   impact and then something crunched into his side, sending him flying through the air another
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:36.420]   kaddashim's arms locked around his waist. He caught a glimpse of Altian standing,
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:43.740]   kaddashim swarming upon him, then Veredis was slamming into the ground. Pain exploded in his
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:50.220]   shoulder and his sword skidded away. He rolled, punched at his attacker, for a moment staring
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.700]   into its black soulless eyes. Then they were sliding into the stream, the kaddashim beneath
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:59.980]   him, his hands fastening about its neck, squeezing, seeking to crush the life from the black-eyed
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:06.540]   abomination. It bucked and kicked like a wild stallion, thrashing a tempest amidst the stream
[00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:13.300]   water, but Veredis would not let go. He felt its strength ebbing, some of its vitality fading,
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:18.420]   then hands gripped him from behind, dragging him backwards, his fingers slipping as he was
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:25.020]   hauled to the bank. Another kaddashim stood over him, drawing its sword from its back as
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:30.700]   the one from the stream splashed into view. He rolled and saw a handful of kaddashim circling
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:36.580]   Altian, who had fallen to one knee, the giant bleeding from a dozen wounds. Veredis tried
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:41.460]   to drag himself through the mud towards his friend. Another kaddashim was held in Altian's
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:47.500]   arms. He had one hand gripping its jaw, the other wrapped about its chest. With a savage
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:53.700]   wrench, Altian heaved. Veredis heard the kaddashim's neck break, then the sound of flesh tearing,
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:59.260]   Altian screaming his defiance as he ripped the kaddashim's head from its shoulders. He
[00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:05.380]   flung the corpse to the ground as the black mist boiled from the dead creature's wound.
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:11.980]   A searing pain lanced through Veredis's leg, a kaddashim blade scoring along his thigh.
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:16.260]   He dropped to the ground, looked back at the two kaddashim on the stream bank. They were
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:23.100]   following him, toying with him. The one with the drawn sword slashed his blade across Veredis's
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:30.740]   upheld forearm, a new cut burning like fire. "Think we'll bleed you a while," the kaddashim
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:38.540]   said, leering with pale lips, "pay you back for the chase you've led us." It should not
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:44.820]   end like this. Frustration gave Veredis a last surge of strength and he rolled to his
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:51.700]   feet, pushed himself upright. The kaddashim before him grinned, then paused, cocking its
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:58.860]   head to one side. Figures burst out of the gloom. Veredis's hopes rose and then fell
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:04.860]   as he saw the newcomers were dressed in black breastplates with silver eagles on their chests.
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:10.060]   Eagle guard, no doubt sent by Nefear to make sure that his monsters complete their task.
[00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:16.980]   Ten, twelve, fifteen more men, one of them tall and wide.
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:25.860]   Veredis blinked, something familiar. "Well met, little brother," the big man bellowed,
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:34.740]   whining wildly. A moment's confusion followed swiftly by elation. "Krellus!"
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.680]   Then Krellus and his men were attacking the kaddashim, Krellus taking her head in one
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:45.220]   great swing of his longsword. Another warrior swept into view, this one not dressed as a
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:51.900]   man of tenerbrow but gripping a knife in each hand. He joined Krellus and together they attacked
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:17:00.980]   the kaddashim before Veredis, McKean and Krellus.
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:06.140]   Chapter 2 Nefear
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:12.180]   Nefear stood in the great hall of Drassil and stared at the giant skeleton on its throne.
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:18.740]   The bones of the ribcage surrounded a thick-shafted spear, the wood dark and pale-veined, only
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:25.780]   a hint of black iron of the blade visible, the rest buried in the great tree of Drassil.
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:34.180]   So that is Scald, High King of the Giants, and that is the Starstone Spear. Scald, the
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:40.800]   last man to rule a united empire where giants and men lived together in peace.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:45.980]   Will I be the next to unite this shattered world? The skeleton was mottled yellow and
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:52.460]   brown, ancient, the brow of the skull broad and thick eye sockets, black holes that seemed
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:18:03.340]   to stare at Nefear, questioning him. Are you worthy? Are you capable? He sighed. History
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:11.240]   shall be my judge, nothing and no one else. The hand touched his shoulder.
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:17.740]   Jesus was standing at the head of Threescore Eagleguard. The young warrior had been recently
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:26.940]   promoted to High Captain of the Fairs Warband now that Veridus was gone. Ah, Veridus. Are
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:33.300]   you dead or alive, old friend? It does not seem right that you are not beside me to share
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:39.460]   in this great victory. He had been informed of Veridus's betrayal, his attempt on Calidus's
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:43.100]   life and he and Althean's escape.
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:51.300]   Veridus. How could you abandon me, break your oath to me? He looked at the white scars on
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:56.500]   the palm of his hand, one of them made as a blood oath of brotherhood to Veridus on
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:03.500]   a moonlit hillside in Tenebrel. It felt like a lifetime ago, words and promises spoken
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:13.640]   by different people. "My king," Cesar said. "It is Calidus. He asks for you."
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.340]   Nefear looked back at the skeleton one last time, then turned and strode through the huge
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:25.700]   chamber. The dead were still being cleared from the battle of the day before. Blood stained
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:34.020]   the stone floor. Mounds of corpses lay in stinking piles. Hundreds of them—Kadashim,
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:42.140]   Jeha, Venthalan, Eagleguard, Banothi Giants, many others. The cost of taking Drassil had
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:46.460]   been high, higher than he would have imagined considering that the element of surprise had
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:56.980]   been on their side. But victory is victory. The fortress is ours, the back of our enemy,
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:03.740]   broken. Though many had escaped, reports were coming in of pitched battles still being fought
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:09.340]   beyond the walls of Drassil. Nefear glanced to his right as he passed an open trapdoor
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:15.380]   as wide as the gates of Geralin and the dark stain of blood on the stone before it.
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:22.660]   Michael's blood. The Ben Elim's head now adorned a spear set in the ground of the courtyard
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:30.860]   before the gates of Drassil. It was not alone. But what of Corbin, their bright star? Where
[00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:36.920]   is he? He glared mistrustfully into the yawning dark of the tunnel, knew that Michael had chosen
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:42.540]   to stand and fight there to gain time for many who escaped into the tunnel. Was Corbin
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:49.180]   one of them? There had been no reports of Corbin being seen during the battle. Had he
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:55.060]   even been here? It had been a long night and Nefear felt a greater weariness settling upon
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:21:00.940]   him than he had ever known before. Caesar snapped an order behind him and Eagleguard
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:07.540]   spread to either side, forming a protective column. "Drassil is not yet secure," Caesar
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:13.940]   said in reply to Nefear's inquiring look. The courtyard also bore the signs of yesterday's
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:21.840]   battle, bodies scattered all about, flies buzzing, the metallic aroma of blood everywhere.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:27.340]   For an instant, Nefear thought he saw a wolfen cub tugging at the leg of a dead caddishim,
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:33.860]   but looking back realised it was a small white furred dog. They turned a corner in a street
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:38.300]   and Nefear glimpsed the towering outer walls of Drassil beyond the layers of stone buildings
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:46.640]   latticed with thick branches. This is a truly remarkable place. Branches soared above him
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:51.440]   as thick as towers, with buildings of stone and iron wrapped about them bound tighter
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:22:02.860]   than leather armour. It looks almost alive. The tree, the bones, the fortress, its flesh.
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:07.740]   The rasp of a sword drawn from its scabbard drew his attention and he glimpsed the black-clothed
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:13.920]   warrior hurtling from the shadows of a doorway. Abruptly, Caesar was yelling as more dark
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:20.820]   figures emerged, iron glinting. The Eagleguard moved, shields thudding together around the
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:27.220]   fair obscuring his view. Blood sprayed, spattering the fair's face as an Eagleguard before him
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:33.780]   collapsed. A black-clothed Jihar slipped into the gap carved in the shield wall, surging
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:40.820]   towards Nefear. Nefear drew his sword, fear and rage his constant companions igniting within
[00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:46.420]   him. The shouts and screams of battle faded, his world contracting to the Jihar warrior
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:53.340]   before him. A woman, her dark-skinned face all sharp bones almost fragile looking.
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:23:00.340]   "Truth and courage!" she yelled, curved sword rising.
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:04.500]   There was an explosion of sparks as their weapons met, the power of the Jihar's strike
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:12.500]   making the tendons of his wrist shriek, shuddering on into his arm and shoulder. He pushed forwards,
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:17.700]   knowing to retreat was to die, tried to move within her guard, use his short sword where
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:24.460]   her longer blade would hinder her. They collided, limbs tangling as both crashed to the ground,
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:28.700]   wrestling, punching, kicking and biting at each other as they rolled back and forth across
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:33.140]   the stone street, with a battle raging all about them.
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:37.980]   The Jihar struck a glancing blow that made his vision blur, then her knee crunched into
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:43.180]   his groin and he slumped, pain exploding, pulsing through him in savage waves, draining
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:49.060]   his strength. She pulled herself free and half rose as he coughed into the cold stone,
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:56.580]   tried to rise, knew if he didn't, he was dead. Fear and rage sparked inside him, sent new
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:02.140]   energy coursing through his veins. "I'll not die here."
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:09.300]   The Jihar stood over him, sword raised, her eyes bright with victory. Then a form crashed
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:14.900]   into her, throwing her to the ground. She started to rise and a boot slammed into her
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:21.980]   jaw, sent her crashing back down. The figure was blurred, a buzzing cloud swirling about
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:27.540]   it. Hands gripped him and pulled him upright, says as his concerned face appeared, blood
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:33.300]   sheeting from a long cut across his forehead. Nefert looked past him, saw his rescuer pull
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:39.620]   a sword from a scabbard upon its back and raised it over the unconscious Jihar. "A kaddashim?"
[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:46.620]   "No," Nefert called. The figure's head turned to look at him, the buzzing cloud parting.
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:57.140]   "Flies," Nefert realized, recognizing the kaddashim. "No, Legion. I want her alive."
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:05.440]   The kaddashim regarded him for a moment with cold black eyes. "Better dead," it said. "I
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:14.620]   want her alive." Nefert snapped. "Kalidas may have questions." "Dead after, then,"
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:22.500]   the kaddashim said, then sheathing its sword. "Kalidas wants you."
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:27.220]   The flesh of its face and neck rippled, seeming to move of its own accord as if something
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:35.340]   were locked within, trying to get out. About them, the battle seemed almost done. Nefert
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:40.500]   scanned the street, counted nearly a score of his eagle guard dead to five or six of
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:46.540]   their Jihar attackers. "This part of Jassil is supposed to have been cleared," he snarled.
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:52.420]   "How did they get in here?" He looked down at the unconscious Jihar's form at Legion's
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:58.020]   feet. "Bring her," Nefert said as he marched away.
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:03.480]   As Nefert entered the courtyard before Jassil's gates, he heard a rumbling growl reverberate
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.380]   from one of the many stables that edged the courtyard. He looked fondly at the doors that
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:14.620]   contained his drake. Kalidas stood before the closed gates of Jassil, to either side
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:19.900]   of him were a host of spears driven into the ground, most of them adorned with a head.
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:25.460]   A handful of Venthalan warriors were planting new spears into the ground, while behind them
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:32.700]   Kalishim prowled into the courtyard's shadows. Before Kalidas knelt a ragged group of people
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:40.540]   bound at wrist and ankle, over three hundred prisoners from yesterday's battle. Above them,
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:45.700]   one guard stood upon Jassil's wars. "My warriors."
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:50.420]   They were easily the best disciplined troops amongst those that had stormed Jassil. The
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:55.600]   Kalishim and many of Lycus's Venthalan were involved in the pursuit of their scattered
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:01.660]   enemy out beyond Jassil's wars, but Nefert suspected that most by far were ranging throughout
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:07.700]   the forest, looting and drinking. The Kalishim were doing other things, such as eating their
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:16.460]   victims. Lycus was standing behind Kalidas. A dozen Venthalan ranged about him, hard-looking
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:23.820]   men, bodies lean and muscular, skin weathered and scarred. Lycus lifted a waterskin to his
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:30.100]   mouth and took a long drink. "I'd wager it's not water that he's drinking."
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:36.460]   The Venthalan saw him approaching and nodded a greeting. Nefert hid his disgust. "Him and
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:43.540]   my mother." "Ah, Nefert," Kalidas said. He raised an
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:49.020]   eyebrow at the blood on Nefert's face, then saw Legion dragging the Jihar warrior across
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:56.900]   the courtyard by her ankle. "Kalidas?" Nefert said, with a dip of his head.
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:02.500]   His old counsellor was not looking his best. Part of his face was burned charcoal black
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:08.100]   and peeling. Silver hair was growing in tufts from patches on his head, elsewhere singed
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:12.780]   to stubble or burned clear. "It would appear that the streets of Drassil
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:19.140]   are not yet cleared of our enemy," Nefert said sourly, as Legion dumped the Jihar warrior
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:24.940]   in front of Kalidas. She groaned, pushing herself to her knees as Legion's hand clamped
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:33.380]   on her shoulder, holding her before Kalidas. "What is your name, child?" Kalidas asked,
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:38.700]   regarding her with his cold eyes. She spat blood at Kalidas's feet and glowered
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:44.780]   up at him. "Ilta," the Jihar said. "And I am no child."
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:54.140]   "Well, Ilta, I shall ask you the same question that I have just put to your comrades. Where
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:59.680]   is Corban?" "You will see him soon enough," a voice said,
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:03.940]   from amongst the prisoners. "He will come for you."
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:09.780]   "And when he does," said Ilta, as she turned her head to look from Kalidas to Nefert and
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:18.300]   Lycos, "he will kill you all." "He is a boy, a puppet. Your ill master is
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:24.260]   already slain," Kalidas said angrily, sweeping a hand towards Michael's head.
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:32.160]   "You are wrong," Ilta said. "Koban is our lord. He slew your best, Sumur, in single
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.340]   combat. We all saw it. He will do the same to you."
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:42.500]   "Sumur," Kalidas frowned. "I saw his head decorating your gates."
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:51.540]   "Corban killed him," the prisoner's voice called out again, one vaguely familiar to Nefert.
[00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:58.660]   "A figure straightened amongst the captives black hair hanging lank about her face. He
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:07.860]   took Sumur's head, and he will take yours, too." "Ah, Cohen, I want nothing more than
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:13.660]   for him to come and try," Kalidas said with a sigh, his expression mocking, but Nefert
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:21.180]   glimpsed something else in his eyes. "Doubt?" "But so far, he does not seem inclined to
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:28.700]   do so," Kalidas continued. "Perhaps a message will speed him to us."
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:35.660]   He looked to the Kalidasim. "Legion, choose one prisoner and impale them upon a spear,"
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:42.340]   he ordered. Legion drabbed Cohen and pulled her, struggling towards a spear. "Not her,"
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:49.420]   Kalidas said with a wave of his hand. Legion grabbed another prisoner. He was a man of
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:54.900]   Izeltir by the look of him. The Kalidasim hoisted him effortlessly into the air and brought
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:31:03.540]   him down slowly upon the upright spear. Then the screaming began. When it was over, the
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:09.400]   prisoner was skewered like a squirrel, ready for the cook fire. He was writhing upon the
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:15.880]   spear, blood pooling about his feet, screaming himself to oblivion. Nefert resisted the urge
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:24.060]   to cover his ears. "On your feet," Kalidas said to Iltar. "Go and tell Corban what is
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:29.980]   happening to his followers, what I am doing. Tell him I will not stop until he has faced
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:34.500]   me." Legion pushed her stumbling forwards as, with
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:41.940]   a rumble, the gates opened. She looked back once and then ran, the gates slamming behind
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:49.220]   her. Kalidas barked in order and the remaining captives were led away. Cohen caught Nefert's
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:53.180]   eye as she walked in line, hatred pouring from her.
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:32:01.980]   "We must talk soon," Kalidas said to Nefert and Lycos. "Hi, son, and the Great Hall."
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.740]   Then he was striding away.
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:10.620]   Lycos raised an eyebrow and offered Nefert his water-skin. Without thinking, Nefert took
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:17.640]   it and drank, then coughed, almost choking on the contents. "Is that . . . mead," Lycos
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:25.180]   finished for him, found a dozen wagons with barrels full of the stuff. Nefert handed it
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:31.380]   back to him and Lycos walked away, chuckling to himself, his Venthallan following him.
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:38.420]   Nefert headed for the wide stairs that scaled Drassil's walls and climbed to the top, stopping
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:42.980]   above the great gates where he stared out at the world beyond.
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:48.180]   A wide plain circled the fortress, clear blue sky bathing the ground in sunshine before
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:52.140]   the great trees of fawn blotted it from view.
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:58.300]   He caught a glimpse of Ilta just before she disappeared into the tree-line. Behind him,
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:04.620]   he heard the footsteps of Cesus and his eagle-guard stopping a respectful distance away. The screams
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:10.820]   of the impaled in the courtyard were much fainter up here, fading to a pathetic mewling.
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:16.500]   He wished he would just die. "How have I allowed myself to come to this?"
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:23.860]   "It is for the greater good. For me to win the war, Corbin must die. To bring peace to
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:28.020]   the banished lands, Corbin must die."
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:32.860]   He felt his resolve stir, but still the screams wormed their way into his head, reminding
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:36.740]   him of other battles, other deaths in the name of this great cause.
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:45.380]   "And now I follow the path of Karushim, of demons, of As-Roth himself."
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:49.260]   He remembered Caledus' words to him in Murias, so persuasive.
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:56.260]   It had all been so logical when Caledus explained it, made sense of the alliances, the lies,
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.740]   deception upon deception, heaped in a great pile.
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:04.980]   "But the truth is simpler," a voice seemed to whisper inside his mind.
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.940]   Deep down, he knew.
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:12.660]   It was more basic when all was stripped away. Caledus' persuasive arguments and philosophical
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:17.780]   debates on good and evil, right and wrong, the abstract meanings that were attached to
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:22.900]   names, politics, power struggles, who deserved what.
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:27.100]   The honest answer was much simpler than any of those meandering debates, and one that
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:31.740]   had been clearly reinforced by his brief struggle with the Jihad warrior before him.
[00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:38.140]   "I don't want to lose."
[00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:39.900]   CHAPTER 3
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:40.900]   Coraline
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:49.580]   Coraline sat with her back to a tree, staring into the dawn gloom of fawn, absently twirling
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:52.820]   a knife between her fingers.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:56.140]   Behind her were the sleeping forms of three score or so of the survivors with whom she
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:59.060]   had fled Drassil.
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:04.980]   Across them was Brinna, gray hair poking from beneath her cloak. Beside her, the bolts of
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:09.260]   Feral and Laith curled close together.
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:15.820]   She glimpsed the Jihad, Akar, standing guard on the far side of their camp. Exhaustion
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:20.340]   hovered at the fringes of her consciousness and, in so many ways, it would be wonderful
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:23.020]   to lose herself in the nothingness of sleep.
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.820]   But she couldn't.
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:30.780]   Her mind was reeling, a whirlwind of grief, fear and rage as fractured moments of the
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.500]   previous day played out in her mind's eye.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:43.020]   Out of them all, though, everything kept returning to one thought, circling, "Where is Corbin?"
[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:47.980]   The fog of tiredness crept upon her again, a relentless assault, but she knew that sleep
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:53.740]   would not come, the shock and horror of yesterday's battle was still too present.
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:36:00.700]   There was a soft footfall from behind and a figure came to stand beside her – Gar.
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:05.340]   The lord of the Jihad looked at her, lines of worry etched upon his usually unreadable
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:07.140]   face.
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:12.500]   He was clothed in a shirt of dark chain mail, splattered with grime and blood, his curved
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:18.360]   sword sheathed across his back, a single bladed throwing axe hanging at his belt.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:23.700]   Then he was not free of injury, a blood-stained bandage was tied around his forehead.
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:29.660]   "Storm is with him," Gar said, as if he could read her thoughts.
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:34.820]   "They must be as plain to read upon my face as are his."
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:35.820]   Storm.
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:39.260]   "That was a measure of comfort."
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:45.100]   Corbin knew that the wolfen was a better guardian than a dozen shieldmen, but still, "We will
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:48.340]   find him," Gar said.
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:52.940]   Corbin had seen the familiar scuff marks of Storm's claws in the tunnel, which was why
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.420]   they had exited at this spot.
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:01.420]   After a brief search, she'd found more tracks leading to the brow of the slope, but darkness
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:05.620]   has settled upon them and no matter how frustrating, it was pointless to stumble around in the
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:06.620]   dark.
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:10.700]   "But where can Corbin be?"
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:16.500]   He must have heard the din of battle from Drassil, even if he were this far away.
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:21.740]   The thoughts rose unbidden in her mind, the one thought she had refused to acknowledge
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.980]   throughout the long dark of night.
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:27.680]   What if he is slain?
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.460]   What else could have kept him from returning to Drassil?
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:36.020]   She felt a worm of fear wriggling through her belly but refused to consider it.
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:38.260]   "He lives."
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.140]   He must.
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:46.700]   She nodded and stood, sheathing her knife, a myriad of cuts, bruises, and strains aching
[00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:48.740]   for attention.
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.260]   She ignored them all.
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:54.580]   "We need to go," she said.
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:58.020]   "Aye," Gar agreed.
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.380]   He continued to stare at the trapdoor.
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:06.820]   "I had hoped that Michael would find us, that he escaped."
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:12.460]   Corbin remembered her last sight of the Ben-el-Im, wielding his sword two-handed, feet planted
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:16.020]   before the entrance to the tunnel in Drassil's great hall as they had retreated into its
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.820]   shadows.
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:23.900]   Swaths of blood had surrounded him as he swung his sword in deadly arcs, holding back the
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:26.940]   enemy, protecting them, purchasing them time to escape.
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:33.580]   "He would have come by now, if he could," Corbin said.
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.740]   Gar sighed and nodded.
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:41.800]   Corbin cocked her head, listening, staring down the hill.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:46.260]   Something was moving in the undergrowth, heading towards the trapdoor.
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:50.180]   Gar saw it, too, and without words the two of them separated, slipping into the shadows
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:54.260]   as they quietly surrounded the intruder.
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:39:00.020]   Bushes rustled, a twig snapped, and Corbin caught a glimpse of dark hair.
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:01.860]   She knew it wasn't Corbin.
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.580]   Even he isn't that clumsy.
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:09.980]   A figure burst from the undergrowth, a young man clad in leather and wool, his dark hair
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:14.580]   tousled and a scabbing cut marking his forehead.
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:19.020]   He started at the sight of her, fumbled for a weapon at his belt, his eyes widening.
[00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:24.780]   "I know you," Corbin said, though she didn't remember his name.
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:32.460]   "Your da is Attilius," a competent, unassuming warrior, Attilius had been a slave oarsman
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:35.420]   on a Vinthalen ship.
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:38.500]   The lad nodded, his lip trembling.
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:42.540]   "Pax, what are you doing here?"
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:47.780]   Gar said, stepping silently from the shadows, making the young warrior jump again.
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:51.180]   "You must come quickly," Pax blurted.
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:52.180]   "My da!
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:53.180]   Corbin!
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.180]   Giants!"
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:56.180]   "Corbin?"
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:57.180]   Corbin hissed.
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.180]   "Aye!
[00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.120]   We must go!"
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:05.100]   Gar was spilling down Pax's cheeks now, tracing tracks through blood and grime.
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:08.180]   "He's dead."
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:12.620]   Corbin froze, feeling as if a fist had just clamped around her heart.
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:16.540]   "I ran," Pax said.
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:21.580]   He began to shake, an involuntary twitching that quickly became more violent.
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:24.900]   "Where is Corbin?"
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:28.820]   Corbin asked, trying to control the panic leaking through her, reaching out to grab
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:32.340]   the now sobbing boy and shake the scents from him.
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:37.420]   "Hold," Gar said, putting a hand upon her arm.
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:41.020]   "Pax, you must tell us as clearly as you can.
[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:42.580]   Where is Corbin and Yoda?
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.980]   What happened?"
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:49.880]   Others were coming down the hill now, corralling glimpse dath and color, a handful of jihar
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.900]   lath looming behind them.
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:57.620]   "We heard, fighting, knew Corbin was out there," Pax began, haltingly.
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:59.980]   "We found him, facing giants and bears."
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:00.980]   "What?"
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:05.100]   "But there were no giants within the fair at Drassil."
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:06.100]   "Dah!
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:09.060]   He threw a spear at a giant, then we all ran.
[00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.220]   We thought we'd lost them.
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.220]   Then—"
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:14.020]   "Go on," Gar said.
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:18.660]   The whole group was gathered around them now, listening in absolute silence.
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:24.100]   "They came from nowhere, my dah."
[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.140]   He rubbed his eyes, blew out a long breath.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:31.780]   "They killed my dah.
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.220]   Corbin told me to run to fetch help."
[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:36.620]   "When did this happen?"
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:40.340]   Gar asked, not able to keep the urgency from his voice.
[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:44.900]   "Yesterday, after High Sun before sunset."
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.660]   Pax's face had grown paler as he spoke.
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.060]   Now he looked like a corpse.
[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:50.220]   "I ran.
[00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:53.340]   I fell, hit my head."
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.740]   He raised a hand to the cut on his brow.
[00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:58.980]   "When I came to, it was dark.
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:01.940]   I've been trying to find my way since then."
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.900]   "Take us, now," Gar said.
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:07.140]   "I will try," Pax nodded.
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:13.100]   "I became lost for a while, but I know it was that direction."
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:17.900]   Gar barked orders and then they were moving, Corbin taking the lead with Pax, Gar jogging
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:22.060]   beside the lad, a steadying hand on his arm.
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:28.180]   Then storm, facing giants, alone, yesterday.
[00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:32.620]   She sent a silent prayer to Elion, one of many that she had made over the last half
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:33.620]   day.
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:37.660]   "Let them still live."
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.020]   Corbin was the first to enter the Glade.
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:45.700]   At its far end was a sudden ridge, and beyond it, the sound of a fast flowing river.
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:51.060]   The smell hit her first, the metallic tang of blood and decay.
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:52.500]   Death.
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:57.380]   Flies were buzzing in great clouds about bodies heaped on the floor.
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:03.060]   She counted three giant corpses on the ground, and Atilius, pinned to a great oak by a giant's
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.700]   axe.
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:07.420]   She could not see Corbin or Storm.
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:12.060]   She ran to the first giant, who was on his back, a hole in his belly, throat cleanly
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:17.780]   cut, his wrist bearing the tell-tale ripping wounds of the wolfen.
[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:23.060]   Corbin moved on, dimly aware of others spilling into the Glade behind her, the sound of Pax's
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:29.140]   sobs as he dropped to his knees before his dar, Gar's presence at her shoulder.
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:34.480]   The other two giants were close together, the ground trampled, rutted, dark and still
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:37.140]   sticky with blood.
[00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:42.860]   One's throat had been ripped out by Storm, the flesh mangled and torn.
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:46.320]   He is not here, nor Storm.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:49.980]   The relief was a physical thing, though she knew their absence did not mean that they
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:55.580]   were safe or even alive, but it was clear they had fought here and won.
[00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:58.980]   They slew three giants.
[00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:03.980]   She felt a flush of pride at that feat, knew that it would be a story told around the campfire
[00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:08.020]   this very night, adding to the tales that were growing up around Corbin and his wolfen
[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:10.220]   companion.
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.380]   The other giant lay upon his front.
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:18.740]   Gar and Corbin tried to turn him over together, flies buzzed angrily, the huge warriors' dead
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:21.540]   weight like a boulder.
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:26.020]   Farrell and Laith joined them, and together they rolled the giant, the stench of corruption
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:28.820]   and decay wafting up to them as they disturbed the body.
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:35.300]   "He is of the Jotun clan," Laith spat as they stood and stared at the dead giant.
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:39.340]   "What are they doing here?"
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:43.820]   Corbin's eyes were drawn to the glint of leather and iron amidst the congealed blood.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:48.260]   She bent and wrapped a fist around the hilt of a sword buried deep in the giant's thigh,
[00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:50.020]   angled upwards into its groin.
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:55.740]   It came free with a sucking sound, and she lifted it for them all to see, the pommel
[00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:58.420]   shaped like a howling wolfen.
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:02.820]   The relief she'd felt fled, replaced by the crushing weight of fear.
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:07.260]   "That's Ban's sword," Dath said as he joined them.
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:10.860]   Collar, a pace behind him.
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:14.500]   Corbin stared at them a moment, felt a wave of sympathy for them.
[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:18.580]   They'd been weighed less than two nights.
[00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:20.860]   Gar took the sword from her and stared at it.
[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:24.580]   "I watched Ban's da give him this blade."
[00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:29.860]   "In the rowan field at Duncarig," Farrell said, "I remember it."
[00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:31.860]   "And I?"
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:34.300]   Dath muttered.
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:38.740]   Ban turned away, her eyes scanning the ground, searching for any sign.
[00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:40.980]   "He is not here.
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:42.740]   Storm is not here.
[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:47.020]   They escaped, but they did not make their way back to Drassil.
[00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:48.780]   Why?"
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:51.660]   Brinner was on her knees beside the giant.
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:55.780]   The old healer had a file in one hand, a knife in the other that she was using to scrape
[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:58.980]   blood from the trampled grass.
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:03.980]   One side of Brinner's face was still an angry red, seared by the explosions she had generated
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:07.620]   that had rocked the chamber in Drassil yesterday.
[00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:13.200]   Whatever benefit Brinner thought the giant's blood would bring, she was welcome to it.
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:18.140]   As Coraline scanned the rest of the clearing, her eyes caught a patch of crushed grass spattered
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:19.980]   with blood.
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:25.780]   It was close to the edge of the glade, leading to a sheer drop to the river below.
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:29.100]   As if something were dragged.
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:34.820]   She followed the marks and dropped to a crouch, looking down to the river.
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:38.860]   Further down she spied a dark smear on a boulder, blood.
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:43.580]   "They jumped into the river!" she called out.
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:45.940]   Gar was first to join her.
[00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:49.420]   His eyes found the same evidence and he gripped her wrist.
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:53.620]   "After them!" he said.
[00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:58.740]   Coraline led the way, running along the ridge that shadowed the river, twisting around thick-rooted
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:03.420]   trees in dense vegetation, her eyes flitting between the path she was navigating and the
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:06.340]   banks of the river.
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:11.620]   Rounding a sharp bend in the path, she suddenly saw a shape lying on a grassy verge, firm
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:14.500]   ated and blood-stained.
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.500]   Her heart stopped.
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.660]   "Storm!"
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:23.220]   She skidded to a halt on the ridge above the wolfen, a part of her mind noticing large boot
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:25.620]   prints in the grass.
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:30.580]   In a spray of dirt, she scrambled over the edge, clinging to root and vine as she made
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.940]   her way down to the riverbank.
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:39.180]   Storm lay still as stone, and she was covered in blood, a huge wound was visible above her
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.620]   shoulder.
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:45.700]   Coraline crouched, too scared to touch her, not wanting to confirm what her eyes were
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:48.300]   telling her.
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:52.860]   Stifling tears, she remembered the first time she had seen Storm, when she had threatened
[00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:56.140]   to turn the wolfen into a cloak.
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:01.720]   Even then she had seen the bond between Coraline and his faithful and vigilant shadow.
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:06.460]   Since then, she had developed her own bond with the wolfen, more like a sword-brother
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.300]   to her than a mere animal.
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:14.980]   As Gar joined her, she tentatively reached out her hand and laid it upon Storm's body.
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:16.580]   She felt nothing.
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:20.700]   "No, please, Elion above."
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:27.360]   She screwed her eyes shut tight, pressed harder, flattening her palm against Storm's deep chest,
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:33.220]   willing her hand to feel the movement of life, a drawn breath, the pumping of Storm's heart.
[00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:38.340]   With every moment, her hopes faded, a bleakness taking hold inside, spreading through her
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.940]   like ink through water.
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:42.380]   And then?
[00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:43.380]   She felt it.
[00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:48.780]   A flicker, a heartbeat deep within the cavern of Storm's broad chest.
[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:52.580]   Then opened her eyes and saw Storm's amber gaze regarding her.
[00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:58.860]   The wolfen whined, a weak, miserable sound, but one that gave Coraline a rush of joy.
[00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:05.660]   Storm's tail thumped feebly on the turf.
[00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:10.620]   Chapter 4 Corbin
[00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:15.020]   Corbin walked through a world of grey, dimly aware that he was staggering close to a wide
[00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:17.140]   and dark river.
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:21.620]   There was a splash and a wide ripple, the hint of something large and sinuous in its
[00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:23.420]   depths.
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:28.700]   Bloated dark clouds boiled above him, flickering with lightning, and black shapes winged through
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:32.500]   them with an occasional gleam of chainmail and iron.
[00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:35.420]   This is the other world.
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:41.580]   His knee throbbed and a pain spasm through his chest with every in-drawn breath.
[00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:46.300]   He fixed his eyes on the ground before him, concentrating on each step.
[00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:50.200]   There had always been an element of the other world that calmed him, a serenity that settled
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:54.220]   within him that gave him a sense of strength and hope.
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:56.480]   But this time was different.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:59.020]   There was something frayed about the peacefulness.
[00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:01.560]   It felt force.
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:07.460]   Something lurked at the fringes of his mind, trying, needing to be remembered.
[00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:12.620]   When next he looked up, the river was flowing into a valley, cliffs rearing up by the side
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:15.740]   of him tall and forbidding.
[00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:19.340]   Inside of him, the river spilt into a lake.
[00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:22.940]   Vibrant colour was seeping into the landscape with every step into the valley.
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:29.740]   The grass grew greener, the river bluer, as if colour was seeping up from the rock below.
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:33.820]   I know this place had been here before.
[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:37.220]   The green valley and the lake of deep blue.
[00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:40.140]   Gentle waves lapped against the shore.
[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:45.500]   A sound drew Corbin's eye towards the lake's heart, a splash and ripples, as if a stone
[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.380]   had been thrown into water.
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:52.460]   His memory prodded at him and his eyes wandered back to the lakeshore, searching for something
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:55.140]   else and then he saw it.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:59.540]   The red-leafed maple that he had once sat beneath.
[00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:04.500]   Without thinking, he made his way to it and sat down, his back to the trunk.
[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:10.220]   Everything was still, no breeze to stir the grass or leaves, no hum of insects.
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:12.900]   The silence was oppressive.
[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:19.380]   And then, high above, like a heartbeat, there was a beat of wings.
[00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:23.680]   He glanced up through the lattice of leaf and bark and saw a figure silhouetted against
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:29.460]   the clouds, human-like, a spear clutched in one hand, broad, white-feathered wings powering
[00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:32.060]   it through the air.
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:38.420]   The Ben-Elim, Michael, Michael.
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:42.260]   Then, like an avalanche, he remembered.
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:47.300]   Michael, in the great hall of Drassil, telling Corbin about the deception of the Ben-Elim,
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:52.420]   how the prophecy was nothing more than a strategy, a trick to force Asroth's hand to lure Calidus
[00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:54.980]   and the Karashim to Drassil.
[00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:59.900]   That the bright star and black sun were an invention, fabricated to snare Asroth in a
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:02.380]   trap of his own making.
[00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:07.540]   A sound strategy, maybe, in the great war between Ben-Elim and Karashim, the faithful
[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:14.380]   and the fallen, apart from the fact that it used people's lives like pawns on a throwboard.
[00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:19.420]   My daar's life, my ma'am's, so many others.
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:25.800]   Rage swept through him, veined with betrayal at the memory of Michael's confession.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:29.740]   He remembered resisting the urge to strike Michael, then leaving, knowing his rage was
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:34.540]   at the boundaries of his control, and had ended up sitting upon a hill in the forest.
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:40.500]   He had sat there a long time, contemplating Michael's words, trying to make some sense
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:43.620]   of what it would mean for the future.
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:52.540]   And then the Jotun giants had come, Ildar, their warlord, Slayer of Tuckle, Ghaz Da.
[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:58.860]   Images flickered through his mind, a bear roaring, spittle spraying from its red moor,
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:03.740]   running, foliage whipping his face, the thunder of the bear's pursuit, the wounds to his knee
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:10.520]   and chest, a spear piercing Storm, a river, ice-cold water.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:15.020]   Storm howling as giants had dragged him away from her side.
[00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:16.460]   Storm.
[00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:20.620]   Pain shuddered through Corbin's chest as if someone were gripping his heart, squeezing
[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:22.100]   and twisting it.
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:24.900]   He couldn't breathe.
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:27.780]   His sorrow was a physical thing that crushed the air from his lungs.
[00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:32.900]   He staggered towards the lake, dropping to his knees at the water's edge.
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:38.380]   And as he did so, more memories flooded his mind, an unstoppable wave of drassil, the
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:43.220]   frantic blowing of horns and sound of battle that had drifted up to him.
[00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:50.460]   Images of his loved ones swam before his eyes, Coraline, Gaar, Cohen, Dath and Farrell, Brynna,
[00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.940]   so many others.
[00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:54.740]   Do they still live?
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:57.140]   Who was attacking drassil?
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:54:01.980]   Dimly, he became aware of movement.
[00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:07.140]   Around him, the water of the lake started to shift and foam, something rising from the
[00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:08.140]   depths.
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:15.140]   A shape appeared, water cascading and masking for a moment the creature within.
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:20.220]   Then a man was striding from the lake, with water dripping from the dark cloak that trailed
[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:22.500]   him like seaweed.
[00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:26.900]   He approached Corbin, an interested, amicable smile upon his face.
[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:29.420]   His skin was grey-mottled and veined like a dead thing.
[00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:32.340]   His hair was black and slick as oil.
[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:36.220]   A black scabbarded sword hung at his hip.
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:43.160]   "Well," the man said, "it's not often that I get visitors."
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:47.580]   His voice was liquid, flowing like a shallow stream over shingle.
[00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:51.260]   "What brings you to my home?"
[00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:55.660]   "I, I've been here before," Corbin said.
[00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:59.860]   "I know, I've watched you."
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:03.260]   "This is the other world," Corbin said.
[00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:10.980]   "It is, and this lake, this tree, this valley," the dark-haired man said with a wave of his
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:14.300]   hands, "are mine."
[00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:17.460]   He shrugged, water dripped from his hair.
[00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:21.000]   "Are you Ben Ellum?"
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   Corbin asked.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.460]   The man laughed, a damp exhalation.
[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:30.260]   "Those pompous fools, no, though to my shame we are related."
[00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:34.140]   "Carashim," Corbin asked, fearful.
[00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:39.660]   "Hardly," the man snorted, "those fawning debauch deviants.
[00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:42.060]   Do I look like one of them?"
[00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:44.100]   "No," Corbin admitted.
[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:49.980]   "Well, then, I am just me, Viathan."
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:55.260]   He lifted his hands, held one up to the sky, splayed his fingers.
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:58.340]   Corbin saw that they were webbed like a frog's feet.
[00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:03.220]   "You are from the world of flesh, are you not?"
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:04.860]   The man said.
[00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:06.460]   Corbin nodded wearily.
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:12.660]   "And what is your name, creature of flesh?"
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:18.900]   Viathan asked him, leaning in uncomfortably close, his breath washing over Corbin moist
[00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:22.060]   and full of rot.
[00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:23.880]   Corbin did not want to tell him.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:30.260]   "I'm going to go now," he said, standing, wanting to be far away from his creature.
[00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:34.020]   "I don't think so," Viathan sighed.
[00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:42.260]   "I think we should continue this conversation somewhere a little more private."
[00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:45.180]   Corbin backed away, turning to leave.
[00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:47.260]   Something grabbed his ankle.
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:51.500]   Looking down, he saw that it was a tendril of Viathan's cloak, flexing like a grasping
[00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:52.900]   limb.
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:56.240]   It wrapped itself around his leg as Viathan walked back towards the lake.
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:02.500]   Then, with shocking strength, the cloak pulled tight and started dragging Corbin.
[00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:07.380]   For a moment, Corbin was too shocked to resist, but then he scrambled back, yanking at his
[00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:09.980]   ankle, hand grasping for his sword.
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:15.820]   "Come on, don't dally," Viathan called over his shoulder as he reached the lake.
[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:19.780]   He walked in, sinking rapidly.
[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:25.300]   The cloak seemed to split to flow, forming a myriad of strands, reaching up to Corbin,
[00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:29.220]   each one contracting around his ankles, wrists and throat.
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:35.020]   Then, he was being pulled down to the lakeshore, trussed like a fly in a spider's web into
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:36.900]   the water.
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:41.180]   Panic filled him as his head sank beneath the surface and he struggled desperately,
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:45.260]   straining veins bulging, muscles screaming.
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:50.020]   With a sinew tearing effort, he pulled one arm free and then he was bursting out of the
[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:54.780]   water, hoisted into the air, dangling before the creature, held up by his dark cloak that
[00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:59.100]   looked now more like a squirming nest of snakes.
[00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:04.620]   Corbin gasped for breath, ripping at the cloak strands, enclosing him to little effect.
[00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:06.860]   Viathan regarded him with a cold fascination.
[00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:14.340]   "Tell me your name," Viathan said, anger swelling in his voice the crash of waves upon rocks.
[00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:18.820]   "Let me go," Corbin grunted through his constricted chest.
[00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:26.180]   "You have trespassed here, disturbed my rest," Viathan said wetly as he pulled Corbin closer.
[00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:37.220]   "In return, I will have some answers, and then, after, I may see how you taste."
[00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:40.820]   A wave of found breath engulfed Corbin, making his stomach lurch.
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:42.740]   "What are you?"
[00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:43.740]   Corbin coughed.
[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:51.660]   "I am Viathan," the creature said, his mouth opening wide, seeming to grow before Corbin's
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:58.020]   eyes wider and wider, revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth glistening and dripping with mucus.
[00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:03.660]   "Eater of souls."
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:09.700]   There was a whistling sound, and a spear slammed into Viathan's cloak, piercing it.
[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:13.580]   Corbin screamed as Ben-Elim swept down from the sky.
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:17.200]   More spears flew, stabbing into Viathan's body.
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:22.300]   His yell deepened into a bellow of pain and rage, and Corbin found himself thrown to the
[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:26.940]   ground as the creature turned its attention to its attackers.
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:31.420]   Then hands were grasping Corbin, and he was hoisted into the air again.
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:37.980]   There was a Ben-Elim either side of him surging skywards, their wings beating hard.
[00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:43.220]   When heartbeats the conflict in the lake was below them, Viathan and his living cloak sinking
[00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:49.980]   into the water, one strand coiling around a Ben-Elim, dragging it beneath the surface.
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:55.380]   The Ben-Elim's scream cut short as the water closed over its head.
[00:59:55.380 --> 01:00:00.420]   They flew higher, following the course of a winding valley, twisting and turning amongst
[01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:05.520]   peaks and sheer cliffs until Corbin saw a fortress appear in the crags, a series of
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.540]   towers and battlements.
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:13.020]   Carved from bone-white stone, it seemed to glow, even under the dark clouds that pressed
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:15.540]   down from above.
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:20.340]   The silhouettes of Ben-Elim filled the air about its towers, some spiraling amidst the
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:26.380]   clouds, others hovering sentinels with long spears and glistening mail.
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:31.260]   He saw that many more patrolled the long winding walls, and the sounds of combat drifted up
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:35.460]   to him from the huge courtyards between the high towers.
[01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:38.700]   They are sparring, as we were in Jassil.
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:41.660]   They are preparing for war.
[01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:45.860]   His rescuers are lighted upon the flat roof of a tower and half-dragged Corbin through
[01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:52.420]   an archway, down a flight of stairs, marching him into a huge, high-ceilinged chamber.
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:58.100]   Within it, thousands of Ben-Elim stood, all gleaming mail and white feathers, a dense
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:03.940]   crown which parted before Corbin and his guards in an elegant ripple of feather and mail,
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:07.700]   and pale, emotionless faces staring at him.
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:14.700]   In front of him was a raised dais, wide steps leading up to it, and upon it a great white
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:20.860]   throne, paler's bone, a splayed-back fashion to look like feathered wings that rose and
[01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:24.980]   curled about the figure slumped within it.
[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:29.180]   Its white feathered wings were wrapped around the figure like a great cloak, feather-tips
[01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:31.780]   draping the floor.
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:37.460]   The figure's head was bowed, dark hair hanging, concealing its face.
[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:42.980]   As Corbin was marched closer, the figure raised its head, its hair parting to reveal a familiar
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:46.580]   face that stared back at him.
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:48.940]   Michael.
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:53.780]   Emotions ignited within Corbin warring with one another, relief at seeing the face of
[01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:58.700]   a comrade, a friend in this strange place, but alongside that the still raw wound of
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:01.460]   Michael's betrayal.
[01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:06.180]   Michael felt his cheeks flush with anger, even as Michael sat straighter, his face racked
[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:10.540]   with grief and pain, an expression that was so out of place on the face of creatures normally
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:12.700]   marble-carved and expressionless.
[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:15.780]   "What is wrong with him?"
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:18.180]   Michael drew in a shuddering breath.
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:22.420]   "Thank Elyon," Michael said.
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:26.700]   "You still live in your world of flesh.
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:32.320]   If your spirit is here, then your body has survived."
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:36.540]   Michael seemed to struggle with his speech, as if each word took an effort of pain and
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:37.540]   will.
[01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:44.660]   "Otherwise, your spirit would have crossed the bridge of swords."
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:47.020]   Corbin blinked.
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:51.680]   Michael reached out, beckoning Corbin to come closer.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:52.680]   Corbin flinched away.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:54.120]   "Don't touch me!"
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.720]   Corbin snapped, remembering the great whore in Drassil.
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.740]   The great lie.
[01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:03.740]   Corbin heard a hiss of outrage ripple through the room behind him.
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:05.260]   Michael held a hand up.
[01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:06.460]   "Peace?"
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:07.660]   Michael said.
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:15.060]   "But," one of the Ben-Elims spluttered, "this creature of flesh, he gives insult to you,
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:18.860]   our High Captain, second only to the All-Father.
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:24.100]   He has good cause," Michael said, lowering his head.
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:28.740]   He leaned back in his chair and gestured for Corbin to stand.
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:32.100]   Corbin saw that Michael was paler than he had ever seen him.
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:34.620]   Around his neck was a red wound, raw and angry.
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:38.180]   It was leaking some clear, ico-like substance.
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:40.420]   "What happened to you?"
[01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:41.420]   Corbin said.
[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:48.340]   "Sometimes, if the wound is bad in the world of flesh, we bring a shadow of it with us
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:51.640]   back to the other world."
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.300]   Corbin's hand went to his chest.
[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:57.420]   The dull ache he felt with every breath, and understood that it was an echo of his broken
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:03:58.940]   ribs.
[01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:02.580]   "So, what is that a shadow of?"
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:05.300]   Corbin said, pointing to Michael's wound.
[01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:10.620]   "I was beheaded in Drassil," Michael said.
[01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:11.620]   "What?"
[01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:16.660]   The horn blasts, the sounds of battle that I heard.
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:20.420]   A seed of dread unfurled deep in Corbin's gut.
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:24.700]   "Calidus, Nathair, they attacked."
[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:25.700]   "How?"
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:28.620]   "The tunnels," Michael said wearily.
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:31.860]   "One of my friends and kin, my people!"
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:34.220]   Some escaped.
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:35.220]   Michael breathed.
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:38.900]   "Gah! let a retreat down the north tunnel.
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:43.980]   I held the caddishim as long as I could."
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.420]   He shook his head.
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:49.300]   "Drassil is taken."
[01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:54.900]   The fortress fallen, taken by Nathair and Calidus.
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:58.060]   The implications hit Corbin like a stone fist.
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:00.220]   My warband defeated.
[01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:02.620]   Those that followed me trusted me.
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:03.860]   Dead.
[01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:04.860]   My friends."
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:11.860]   "See what your scheming has achieved," he snarled and launched himself at Michael.
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:15.980]   His attack was so unexpected and so fast that he had his fingers clamped about Michael's
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:18.940]   throat before anyone could move.
[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:24.660]   Then there was an explosion of activity behind him, shouting, hands grasping him, wings flexing,
[01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:25.660]   beating.
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:30.220]   Blows rained upon Corbin, but he shrugged them off, continued squeezing.
[01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:33.700]   Michael did not fight back, just sat within the great wings of his throne and stared into
[01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:36.860]   Corbin's eyes as he cried tears of grief and rage.
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:44.500]   "You've murdered my friends!" he yelled, a red rage swallowing him, replacing his despair.
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:50.280]   Corbin crunched into his head and the world disappeared for a moment in a white explosion.
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:53.900]   He felt his fingers slipping from Michael, tried to hold on, but then more hands were
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:58.700]   gripping him, dragging him back, pressing him onto his knees.
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:03.580]   He looked up to see weapons raised over him and angry faces encircling him.
[01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:06.700]   A spear was speeding towards his heart.
[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:12.860]   "No," Michael said, and the spear froze, a hand span from Corbin's chest.
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:17.180]   Three voices called out, Corbin heard words like punishment and sacrilege.
[01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:23.040]   "No," Michael repeated, and the crowd parted before Corbin to reveal Michael still sitting
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:25.340]   upon the throne.
[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:30.040]   He regarded Corbin with his emotionless face back in place, though Corbin thought he saw
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.980]   cracks within it.
[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:36.180]   "He has caused to be angry with me.
[01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:37.740]   Angry!"
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:38.740]   Corbin shook his head.
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:46.740]   "You lied to me, to all of us in Drassil used us as bait, as pawns, all of you," he added,
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:50.100]   glaring at the Ben-Elim gathered around him.
[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:51.980]   Most of them were glaring back at him.
[01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:56.420]   "And now it seems that your plan has worked a little too well.
[01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:58.960]   You certainly brought Calydus running to Drassil.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:04.180]   Tell me, Michael, was it also part of your plan for Drassil to fall, for my friends,
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:08.240]   my kin, my people, to be slaughtered?"
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.020]   He ground his teeth, swallowed.
[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:13.140]   "Or for you to be beheaded?"
[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:18.940]   "No, it was not," Michael said with a slow sigh.
[01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:23.140]   "The war is lost before it even began.
[01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:29.100]   The Banished Lands conquered all those whom I love slain or scattered."
[01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:33.460]   Despair rose up in him then, draining all energy from his limbs.
[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:36.180]   He slumped in his captor's grip.
[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:41.540]   "It is not over," Michael said.
[01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:45.380]   It took a few moments for his words to seep through the fog of misery and hopelessness
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:46.540]   that engulfed Corbin.
[01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:50.860]   "Of course it is," Corbin whispered.
[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:59.540]   "No, not while you live, not while Calydus still seeks the seven treasures.
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:07.620]   He needs them all to fulfil his plan and until then Asroth is bound here in the other world."
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:11.300]   "There is no way back from this.
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:14.860]   We don't know that," Michael said.
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:17.860]   Gar led many from Drassil.
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:19.620]   They may still live.
[01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:23.940]   There are those who would still stand against Nefaire and Calydus.
[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:29.500]   "There is still hope," Corbin's head snapped up.
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.580]   Locking eyes with Michael.
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:35.900]   "Do not speak to me of hope.
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:40.280]   You who have fed me lies all my life.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:45.100]   You are no better than Asroth and his cardishim, a liar, a deceiver, and I wish I'd never met
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:47.380]   you."
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:50.780]   Angry words rippled around the chamber.
[01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:52.980]   Michael's gaze hardened.
[01:08:52.980 --> 01:09:01.700]   "I have allowed you the courtesy of expressing your anger, but do not go too far.
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:05.940]   There is more at stake here than your hurt feelings.
[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:09.860]   You are behaving like an angry child."
[01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:15.460]   He paused, visibly sagged in his chair, plus the hand over his eyes.
[01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:20.420]   "Your whole world lies in the balance.
[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:22.460]   It is not over yet.
[01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:27.340]   There is still hope, a fighter's chance.
[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:31.380]   There is no chance, nothing that I can do.
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:34.940]   Back in the banished lands I am a captive of the Jotun, wounded.
[01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:40.300]   My bones broken and storm is dead."
[01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:46.900]   His voice choked in his throat, a fresh wave of emotion swelling in his chest.
[01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:49.380]   Michael lowered his head.
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:53.020]   "Better, grievous blow," he muttered.
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:57.620]   "Storm was a better guardian than a score of shieldmen."
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:02.180]   "She was more than my guardian," Corbin snarled.
[01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:07.440]   "She was my companion, my friend."
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:11.260]   He rubbed his eyes, angrily brushed away his tears.
[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:13.980]   "Your lies?
[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:19.300]   Of course the death of my kin, my dad, my mom, my friends, and so many others.
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:26.700]   All of them dying for a hope that never existed, all of them dying for me.
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:31.220]   And because you underestimated Caledas, you have left us with no chance.
[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:38.280]   While there is breath in your body there is a chance," Michael shouted, leaning forwards
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:42.580]   in his chair, hands gripping the armrests.
[01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:46.060]   For a moment his cold face melted away.
[01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:53.460]   "And if there is no chance of victory, then what of vengeance?
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:11:00.100]   Do more than talk and whine, seek your vengeance for those fallen.
[01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:06.540]   Or would you rather wallow in self-pity than try to save your loved ones?"
[01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:10.220]   He sagged, the effort clearly draining him.
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:12.940]   "I will not be told what to do by him.
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:16.160]   I will be controlled and manipulated by him no longer."
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:20.780]   Nevertheless, Michael's words affected him.
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:27.180]   Images of Gar and Coen, Coraline, Farall and Daph, Brynner, Hidana, so many others that
[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:32.580]   he had met during the long, hard journey from his home in Dunkarrog to Drassil.
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:37.980]   And the thought of them without him, perhaps fighting, maybe dying.
[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:43.060]   For a moment all he wanted was to get back to them, to be at their side.
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:48.340]   "I will not abandon them to death or torment, let them face the end alone.
[01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:52.980]   I must go back if there is a chance to help them."
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:57.140]   He looked up at Michael, felt his fists clenching.
[01:11:57.140 --> 01:12:01.820]   "I will go back, but not for you.
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:03.660]   Not for any of you.
[01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:08.780]   I am your prophet no longer. I go to help those that I love."
[01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:13.460]   Michael stared at him for long, silent moments, then nodded his head.
[01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:21.280]   "I will help you all that I can, though I am bound to the other world now.
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:25.140]   I cannot return to the banished lands.
[01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:29.540]   I don't want your help," Corbin growled.
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:35.480]   Michael finally nodded. "Good," he whispered.
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:38.900]   He approached Corbin and placed a palm over his eyes, whispering words that Corbin could
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.220]   not hear.
[01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:49.900]   He opened his mouth to say something, but then the world seemed to fade about him.
[01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:55.420]   Chapter 5 Rafe
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:59.780]   Rafe felt something wet and rough scratching across his cheek.
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:03.460]   He wanted to move but found he lacked the ability.
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:06.820]   Even opening his eyes was too much of an effort.
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:12.100]   So he just lay there, allowing his other senses to wash over him.
[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:17.900]   He ached, his muscles, joints, his very bones seemed to throb, but even as he became aware
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:24.460]   of the sensation, it began to fade, transforming into something else, a sense of relaxed exhaustion
[01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:29.160]   like lying in a hot bath after a long hunt.
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:33.840]   He could hear birdsong, the ripple of river water and the holes of moored boats nudging
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.980]   into one another.
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:41.860]   Beyond that, the drum of hooves, many feet, voices.
[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:45.780]   He did not know how long he lay on the ground like that, but at some point the rough wet
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:50.780]   scratching on his face came back, a dog's tongue licking him.
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:54.420]   A smile cracked his lips and he opened his eyes.
[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:59.220]   An explosion of light burst upon him, feeling as if rays of the sun had pierced his skull,
[01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:01.820]   lancing through his head.
[01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:03.700]   He screwed his eyes shut.
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:04.700]   The pain dimmed.
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:08.220]   He tried again, slowly this time.
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:12.780]   He saw a black nose, snuffling, fur tickling his chin.
[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:16.540]   "That old sniffer!" he croaked.
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:19.140]   His voice roared and cracked.
[01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:22.780]   During the pain he pulled himself to his knees, then to his feet.
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:26.340]   He staggered and braced himself against the wide trunk of a tree.
[01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:29.620]   "What has happened to me?"
[01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:34.700]   He stretched, the stiffness in his body melting away.
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:40.300]   For a while he stood there, feeling his muscles uncoiling, enjoying this sense of energy,
[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:43.180]   of strength and vitality that flowed through him.
[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:49.060]   "I feel good," he muttered, smiling and reaching to Pat Sniffer's head.
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:54.060]   He saw Scratcher standing further away, eyeing him suspiciously.
[01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:58.540]   "It's all right," he said, beckoning the Hound.
[01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:01.300]   "Nothing to fear."
[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:07.020]   The Hound came to him, ears still flattened, tail tucked alone, and he laughed, ruffling
[01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:08.540]   the Hound's fur.
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:11.820]   "I'm starving."
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:13.460]   Memories filtered back.
[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:18.420]   Of the battle in the swamp against Idana's warband, his desperate escape of walking away
[01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:23.820]   from Morkhant's tower after his interrogation by Ryn and her giant Uthas.
[01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:28.360]   Then walking along the riverbank, finding a solitary spot beside a tree to drink a skin
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:31.500]   of wine and eat some cold lamb.
[01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:36.420]   He'd scratched at his chin, felt a thick layer of stubble, which felt strange.
[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:40.300]   "How long have I been here?"
[01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:45.340]   He looked around at the marshland trees and bushes, the birds nesting amongst them, blue
[01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:51.020]   and orange butterflies flitting, then up at the sky, which was a clear blue, the spring
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:54.580]   sun warm upon his face.
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:58.300]   Somehow everything felt sharper, brighter and clearer.
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:01.780]   A field reborn.
[01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:05.900]   He looked down and noticed the shoulder of lamb he'd brought with him from the camp.
[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:10.220]   The Hound had stripped it clean and cracked the bones.
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:15.060]   Beside it were the broken shards of the box he'd found in the bog near Duntaris, and next
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:20.660]   to that was a cup, dark metal, runes carved into its rim.
[01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:30.580]   A dribbit of wine ran from it, and he remembered, like a punch in the gut, "I drank from it."
[01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:33.940]   His legs felt weak and he leaned against the tree as he felt for a moment an echo of the
[01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:38.380]   pleasure and pain that had racked his body after drinking from the cup.
[01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:39.380]   He felt scared.
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:43.020]   "What have I done?
[01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:48.580]   It is an enchanted cup it has some kind of spell upon it, but I'm not dead.
[01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:52.260]   If anything I feel more alive than ever before."
[01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:56.260]   He took a tentative step away from the tree, reached him down to pick up the bag that contained
[01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:57.940]   his kit.
[01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:02.020]   For a few heartbeats he stood and stared at the cup, then quickly bent and grabbed it,
[01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:04.760]   stuffing it into his bag.
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:09.180]   He picked his way along a twisting trail amongst the tall grass banks of reed, eventually coming
[01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:12.820]   across a stream that led him back to the river.
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:14.940]   The river was full of moored boats.
[01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:21.100]   The strong smells of newly cut pine, sap and fresh soaked pitch filled the air.
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:26.740]   Frames of scaffolding timbers that held half-constructed boats lined the riverbank, skeletal hulls
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:30.580]   like the bones of flesh-picked whales.
[01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:33.300]   Teams of men were working on them.
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:38.100]   Rafe walked past unnoticed, moving out onto the rolling meadows that spread beyond the
[01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:43.140]   marshlands and ended in the north at the fringes of the Baglan forest.
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:48.740]   He stopped here, staring, surprised at the difference in what felt like only a half-day
[01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:52.060]   but had clearly been longer.
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:55.820]   Immediately before him was Morkant's tower.
[01:17:55.820 --> 01:18:02.620]   Waynes pulled by shaggy coated auroch, filed in and out of the tower gates.
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:09.340]   On the meadow about it, the tents of Ryn's warband of black and gold had multiplied.
[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:15.340]   To the west, Rafe saw horsemen riding at straw targets, other men on foot sparring with practice
[01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:18.220]   swords and spears.
[01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:22.260]   They are readying for another stab at Adana then.
[01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:23.260]   Rafe
[01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:30.340]   Morkant was striding towards him, looking striking in his black cuirass and sabled cloak, edged
[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:37.260]   in gold trim, hair pulled back, warrior braid freshly bound with gold wire.
[01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:39.460]   Two guards walked at his back.
[01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:45.660]   He looks far better than the last time I saw him, in Ryn's tent, fresh from the battle,
[01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:49.620]   covered in marsh slime and blood and stinking like a stagnant pool.
[01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:53.060]   "Where have you been, boy?"
[01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:55.060]   Morkant snapped at him.
[01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:57.660]   "I...er...over there?
[01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:59.060]   Sleeping?"
[01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:03.340]   Rafe said, pointing vaguely at the river and marshes.
[01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:04.340]   "Sleeping?"
[01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:05.340]   Morkant snorted.
[01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:06.340]   "For a ten-night?"
[01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:07.340]   "A ten-night?"
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:09.340]   "I thought you'd deserted.
[01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:13.460]   Didn't think you had the stomach for any more battle."
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:20.540]   "I have so," Rafe said, bridling at Morkant's veiled insult.
[01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:22.980]   "Watch yourself?"
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:23.980]   Morkant scowled.
[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:30.660]   "I'm Lord of Arden, now, and could put your head on a spike with a snap of my fingers."
[01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:35.820]   Rafe felt a blossoming of anger, hotter and faster than he was used to.
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:38.220]   With an effort, he suppressed it.
[01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:40.660]   "I thought Evernus was Lord of Arden."
[01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:49.060]   "Evernus has not returned, is believed dead," Morkant said disdainfully.
[01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:53.060]   "Ryn has appointed me to rule in his absence."
[01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:54.060]   "Dead?"
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:20:01.980]   In truth, Rafe had lost sight of Evanus when the rebels' fire had started sinking their
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:05.900]   boats and Rafe had become too preoccupied with his own survival to worry about anyone
[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:08.100]   else.
[01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:11.980]   But he would grieve for Evanus if he was dead.
[01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:14.380]   He had been his lord for as long as he could remember.
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:18.300]   His dahr had served Evanus as huntsman for many years.
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:24.900]   "So," Morkant told him arrogantly, "I am your lord now, and you shall remember it.
[01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:26.400]   Now come with me.
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:30.180]   Queen Ryn wishes to speak with you."
[01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:34.420]   He followed Morkant around the rim of the hill, skirting the palisaded wall as they
[01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:38.980]   made their way through lines of tents to a central, larger one.
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:45.820]   Towering like statues, two giants stood outside alongside a handful of Ryn's shieldmen.
[01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:49.140]   Rafe gazed at them as he waited to be announced.
[01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:51.980]   The giant nearest to him was a female.
[01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:56.900]   She stood with folded arms, returning his stare, two knife-hilts as long as short swords
[01:20:56.900 --> 01:20:59.320]   crisscrossing her back.
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:01.780]   Her brow furrowed as she regarded him.
[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:07.900]   "Queen Ryn, we'll see you now," a shieldman told them, and Rafe stepped out of the sunshine
[01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:10.900]   into the cool shadow of the tent.
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:16.820]   Ryn was sat at a broad table, her silver hair braided with golden wire, a bearskin cloak
[01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:19.100]   pulled high about her neck.
[01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:23.940]   A huge parchment was unrolled on the table.
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:28.660]   Rafe glanced at it and saw it was a map of the marshlands, their position at Morkant's
[01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:31.380]   tower marked upon it.
[01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:38.340]   The marshes were largely a blank, with a circle roughly marking the position of Duncryn.
[01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:44.220]   And Ryn stood Uthas of the Banoffee, gripping a thick-shafted spear and about his neck hung
[01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:47.420]   a necklace made from long, curved fangs.
[01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:52.380]   "Ah, the wanderer returns," Ryn cried when she saw him.
[01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:54.420]   "I thought you did.
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:57.580]   Or captured," she added, her eyes narrowing.
[01:21:57.580 --> 01:21:59.700]   "Can I trust you now?
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:02.180]   Where have you been?"
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:05.820]   "Sleeping," Morkant said before Rafe could reply.
[01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.820]   "Who is?"
[01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:08.820]   Ryn asked.
[01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:09.820]   "No one.
[01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:10.820]   Myself."
[01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:11.820]   Rafe stuttered.
[01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:12.820]   "My dogs."
[01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:15.820]   Ryn raised an eyebrow.
[01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:19.960]   "No need to be shy.
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:24.660]   Everyone needs some time to relax and indulge in their personal pleasures.
[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:26.900]   That's what is life for.
[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:31.180]   But sleeping for a ten-night a little extreme, don't you think?
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:32.940]   And a little unbelievable.
[01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:34.660]   Are you lying to me?"
[01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:38.060]   "No, my queen," Rafe mumbled.
[01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:41.260]   "I drank something."
[01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:43.560]   Morkant snorted laughter.
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:46.940]   Ryn paused and stared at Rafe, head cocking to one side.
[01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:49.140]   "Are you well?
[01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:53.300]   You seem different."
[01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:58.420]   Rafe returned her gaze steadily, his eyes drawn to the details of her face.
[01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:02.940]   The wrinkles creased around her mouth, tracing her tapestry upwards across the arch of her
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:06.020]   cheeks to cluster around her eyes.
[01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:09.740]   Her skin appeared so fine, almost translucent.
[01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:15.820]   His gaze was drawn deeper, the pulse of myriad veins beneath her diaphanous skin a steady
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:18.740]   and hypnotic beat.
[01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:24.500]   His gaze drifted higher, to her eyes, which were a deep dark blue like still waters.
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.740]   They transfixed him.
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:33.500]   "Answer your queen," Morkant snapped, raising his hand to cuff Rafe across the back of the
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:35.300]   head.
[01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:39.420]   Rafe saw it all as if in slow motion, and before he had even realised what he was doing,
[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:45.420]   his hand shot up, grabbing Morkant's wrist and stopping it dead in its tracks.
[01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:50.660]   There was a moment of shocked silence, everyone staring at Rafe as Morkant tugged on his arm,
[01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:52.940]   unable to break Rafe's grip.
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:59.540]   "How dare you?" Morkant snarled, as he struggled to free himself before reaching for the knife
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:00.540]   at his belt.
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:04.300]   "I'll carve off your bloody fingers one by one!"
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:08.220]   "Enough," Rin said.
[01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:13.200]   Morkant froze, and with a conscious effort, Rafe suppressed the bubbling anger within
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:16.180]   him and released Morkant's wrist.
[01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:18.940]   Red marks were already purpling into bruises.
[01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:23.500]   "I don't like being struck," Rafe muttered.
[01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:29.780]   "So we can see," Rin said, with a calculating smile.
[01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:34.780]   Morkant scowled at him as Uthas leaned forwards, grey, bushy eyebrows bunching together in
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:35.780]   a frown.
[01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:38.100]   "Morkant is Lord of Arden, then."
[01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:41.140]   "What have I done?"
[01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:47.980]   "I—I am—sorry," he said quietly, then rubbed his eyes.
[01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:53.900]   "I do not know why I did that, or what's happening to me."
[01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:58.100]   Rin exchanged a quick, unfathomable look with Uthas before turning back.
[01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:02.340]   "I have need of you, so I shall forgive you—this once."
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:06.340]   "Thank you, my lady."
[01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:10.380]   Rafe had the sense to dip his head as he spoke, avoiding the urge to glance at Morkant and
[01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:11.380]   smirk.
[01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:17.900]   "And I am—sorry—my queen," he added, for good measure.
[01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:20.700]   Rin waved a hand.
[01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:26.700]   "Sorry is not good enough," she said, a tone entering her voice that scared Rafe.
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:30.700]   "I am your queen, and you are my subject."
[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:36.540]   "Learn your place," "I will," Rafe muttered.
[01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:42.900]   "See that you do," Rin said, "and also make sure that the next time I send for you you
[01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:44.740]   come.
[01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:48.180]   Your life is mine."
[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:51.500]   She stared at him, no hint of expression on her face.
[01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:58.540]   "I can make it a good life, or an unpleasantly short one."
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:25:59.540]   Rafe gulped.
[01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:02.300]   "Do we understand one another?"
[01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:06.620]   "Aye, my queen," Rafe nodded.
[01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:07.940]   "Good.
[01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:11.460]   Now come over here and help me with this map.
[01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:15.140]   I aim to have Adana's head on a platter within a ten-night."
[01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:21.220]   Chapter Six
[01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:24.220]   Kamlin
[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:27.220]   Kamlin padded along the stream's edge.
[01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:30.620]   His bow held loosely in one hand.
[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:33.940]   He was returning to Duncrin from a hunting trip.
[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:34.940]   Hunting men.
[01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:39.860]   It had been a ten-night since the Battle of Duncrin, where Evanus and Morkant's warband
[01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:42.420]   had been largely scattered.
[01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:46.500]   He and a score of others had set about hunting down the stragglers.
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:51.180]   The more we kill now, the fewer will come back to try and kill us later.
[01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:55.700]   Kamlin had split his hunting party into pairs, although he himself had ended up in a group
[01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:57.660]   of three.
[01:26:57.660 --> 01:27:01.580]   He glanced down at Meg, the bairn who he'd rescued from a village on the outskirts of
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:03.500]   the marshlands.
[01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:09.820]   Though she's more than paid me back, the time she's saved my hide now.
[01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:15.320]   She was walking alongside him, wearing a warrior's leather jerkin, holding a spear in one hand,
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:18.980]   her other resting upon the pommel of a new dagger that was hanging at her belt, all of
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:23.380]   them spoils taken from the Battle of Duncrin.
[01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:27.940]   Kamlin had helped her cut down and restitch the jerkin, as well as chopping an arm's length
[01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:31.860]   of the spear to make it more manageable for her.
[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:35.420]   Parts of him had been concerned about her accompanying them.
[01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:37.900]   She's seen worse, though.
[01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:42.740]   A memory of the mottled feet of a bairn swinging from gallows insinuated its way into his mind,
[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:46.540]   beneath it bloated corpses littering a courtyard.
[01:27:46.540 --> 01:27:48.660]   Much worse.
[01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:52.940]   A shadow crossed his path, and he looked up to see the third member of his party flying
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:54.900]   above him.
[01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:58.620]   Craft swooped down and squawked loudly.
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:01.700]   "Dark waters, tall towers."
[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:05.380]   "I know," Kamlin muttered.
[01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:10.420]   "Don't need a bird to tell me when I'm close to home."
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:12.300]   Nevertheless he raised a hand at Craft.
[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:18.100]   When I first met that bird, I must confess I didn't like him much.
[01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:21.820]   Turns out he's right-handed to have about, though.
[01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:27.340]   Craft had led him straight to over a dozen enemy warriors lost in the marshes.
[01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:33.100]   Kamlin had made sure they stayed lost, left them lying face down in the mud.
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:37.940]   He walked through a last bank of reeds and came out on the shore of a huge lake.
[01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:43.180]   The towers and walls of Duncrin reared out of the lake's waters, damp and moss-covered
[01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:47.060]   like some frozen leviathan.
[01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:51.740]   Figures moved on the battlement walls, boats scudding between towers.
[01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:54.380]   All about him on the lakeshore there was motion.
[01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:58.540]   The wives and bands of the warriors who had fought in the battle of Duncrin had finally
[01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:03.340]   returned from their hiding place deeper in the marshes and all manner of rough shelters
[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:10.880]   were being erected, mostly consisting of linen tents and panelled walls of woven willow.
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:14.500]   Best not make themselves too comfortable.
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:18.540]   Meg dashed off and merged into the crowds.
[01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:22.260]   Kamlin watched as a pair of children rummaged amongst the piles of war gear that had been
[01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:26.020]   stripped from the dead and heaped in mounds along the lakeshore.
[01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:33.860]   Great stacks of swords and spears, shields, boots, belts, knives, quivers, shirts of mail,
[01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:38.980]   caresses of boiled leather and cloaks of black and gold.
[01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:40.860]   Meg reappeared at his side.
[01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:45.380]   Now with an iron helmet much too big for her head, added to her outfit.
[01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:48.580]   Kamlin tried not to laugh, it wasn't wholly successful.
[01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:50.140]   "What?"
[01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:51.660]   Meg scowled at him.
[01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:54.820]   "Think that helmet might slow you down?"
[01:29:54.820 --> 01:29:55.820]   he said.
[01:29:55.820 --> 01:29:59.100]   "Besides, your head's thick enough.
[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:01.180]   Doubt if you'll need it."
[01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:02.180]   She punched him in the leg.
[01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:04.780]   "When are we leaving?" she asked.
[01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:06.660]   "Don't know."
[01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:07.660]   He shrugged.
[01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:12.640]   "Probably talk about it a while before we get around to doing this."
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:15.620]   He paused as the crowds opened up before him.
[01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:20.260]   Lidana was walking calmly through their midst, stopping now and again to address someone
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:25.740]   directly, holding a hand here, cupping a cheek there, always seeming to be interested in
[01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:28.140]   what was being said to her.
[01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:34.460]   Baird, the one-eyed warrior of Dohan, and Vaughn accompanied her.
[01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:39.100]   Kamlin frowned as he watched the young warrior, his eyes shadowed with dark circles, grief
[01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:41.660]   carving new lines upon his face.
[01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:45.700]   "Though I'd guess I'm partly to blame for that.
[01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:50.140]   Me having killed his Da might have something to do with his current mood."
[01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:54.860]   He tracked Vaughn after the battle, found him leagues from anywhere, alone apart from
[01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:57.740]   his Da, Evanus.
[01:30:57.740 --> 01:31:00.460]   Kamlin had watched as they'd argued.
[01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:04.920]   It had ended with Vaughn turning his back on Evanus and walking away.
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:11.460]   Evanus had followed, hand dipping inside his cloaking, coming out with a knife in his fist.
[01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:15.220]   Kamlin had put two arrows through the man's chest.
[01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:17.420]   His eyes flickered back to Edana.
[01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:23.960]   "She has grown since that night in Dunkarig when she saw her Da murdered.
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:28.380]   Kamlin fought Roshin of Dohan in the court of swords and won.
[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:32.500]   Mind, exile was too good for a woman like that.
[01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:35.460]   She'll never stop her troublemaking."
[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:39.540]   He searched behind Edana, looking for his friend, Halion.
[01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:42.780]   "He should be back by now."
[01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:48.300]   Then he saw him sitting beside a fire with Lorcan, Halion's half-brother, Roshin's son,
[01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:53.460]   heir to the throne of Dohan and unofficially betrothed to Edana, with his shieldman, broken
[01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:56.580]   no-neck as Meg affectionately referred to him.
[01:31:56.580 --> 01:32:03.180]   "Good to see you," Halion said, rising and gripping Kamlin's forearm.
[01:32:03.180 --> 01:32:07.820]   "You too," Kamlin said with a grin.
[01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:13.420]   Kamlin looked at their faces, saw they were all sombre attention in the air.
[01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:16.500]   Lorcan's dark eyes were red looked as if he'd been weeping.
[01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:19.300]   "Am I interrupting?"
[01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:20.300]   Kamlin asked.
[01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:22.820]   "Just tell me to bugger off if I am."
[01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:31.300]   "No, Kamlin," Lorcan said, standing and surreptitiously wiping his eyes, "I was just going."
[01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:36.520]   He bathed in farewell, Halion squeezing his shoulder and left.
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:38.660]   Brogan followed faithfully in his wake.
[01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:41.040]   "He all right?"
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.380]   Kamlin asked.
[01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:47.180]   "No," Halion said honestly, "but I think he will be.
[01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:51.340]   I know Connell hates him just for being Roshin's son, but I like him.
[01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:53.000]   There's no malice in him."
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:33:01.540]   "Well, that's a rare thing," Kamlin observed, "and he did the right thing with Roshin.
[01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:03.300]   Choosing Adana over his mum wasn't easy."
[01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:09.700]   "True," Kamlin said, "sometimes the right thing could be a grim thing too.
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:15.740]   Aye, and it's weighing heavy on him, and you by the look of it."
[01:33:15.740 --> 01:33:18.900]   Halion looked tired, a strained look about his eyes.
[01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:23.420]   "Job done, then," Kamlin asked Halion.
[01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:27.820]   "Aye," Halion breathed, "got back yesterday.
[01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:29.740]   Did it go..."
[01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:34.020]   He was going to say well, but that didn't seem like the right word.
[01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:36.420]   Halion looked away, staring out into the marshland.
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:40.220]   "Roshin didn't try to escape, if that's what you mean."
[01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:42.900]   "That's something," Kamlin said.
[01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:44.580]   "Aye," Halion shrugged.
[01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:49.780]   "Not the easiest thing I've done," he added, as Kamlin continued to stare at him.
[01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:52.060]   "Thought you hated Roshin."
[01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:53.560]   "I do.
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:58.420]   She murdered my mum, wanted to kill me, and Connell was the reason we fled, Daoin.
[01:33:58.420 --> 01:34:00.340]   And she would have murdered Adana too.
[01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:03.100]   Exile is better than she deserves.
[01:34:03.100 --> 01:34:05.100]   But..."
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:09.980]   Halion shrugged, his sea-grey eyes hinting at the emotion he kept buried within.
[01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:12.420]   "Walking away was hard."
[01:34:12.420 --> 01:34:15.900]   "Execution is hard, you mean.
[01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:22.060]   We called it exile, but leaving her in the middle of the marsh, it was a death sentence."
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:24.620]   Kamlin patted Halion's shoulder.
[01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:26.780]   "Good hunting?"
[01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:27.780]   Halion asked him.
[01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:28.780]   "Aye."
[01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:33.420]   "There are a few less warriors in black and gold to tell the way to this place.
[01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:35.260]   Am I the first back?"
[01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:38.460]   "No, you're the last," Halion said.
[01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:41.340]   "We've all been waiting on you."
[01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:45.740]   Halion refused to hold the council until you were back, safe and sound.
[01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:49.460]   Kamlin felt himself blush at that, a smile twitching his lips.
[01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:53.300]   It felt strange to be valued.
[01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:56.420]   Kamlin looked around the circle of familiar faces.
[01:34:56.420 --> 01:35:00.220]   They were gathered in a clearing amidst the ruins of what looked to have once been done
[01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:02.660]   Kryn's gatehouse.
[01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:08.180]   A collapsed tower rose above them, birds' nests poking from its crumbled ramparts.
[01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:13.700]   The old wall lay in ruins, granite boulders scattered in the grass.
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:18.500]   Beneath their feet, ancient flagstones lay twisted and shattered by the encroaching roots
[01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:21.220]   of willow and alder.
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:26.300]   A crumbling archway framed Adanna, who sat upon a moss-covered boulder.
[01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:30.740]   She looked at home in a coat of male and boiled leather surcoat, a great cloak about her shoulders
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:33.420]   and a sword at her hip.
[01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:39.860]   Surrounding her were those she trusted most closely - Pendathrin, her barrel-chested uncle,
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:46.300]   and Rust, the red-haired warrior from Navon, once Shieldman to Owain, Navon's fallen king.
[01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:52.820]   Lorcan, the young king-in-exile of Daon, gazed solemnly at Adanna.
[01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:57.660]   The others that filled the area were mostly warriors, Shieldman to those present - Halion,
[01:35:57.660 --> 01:36:02.100]   Von, and one-eyed Baird watching Adanna.
[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:07.340]   Close to them, Brogan loomed protectively close to Lorcan.
[01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:11.860]   Kraft perched upon the broken archway above Adanna like a carved statue, and I've no doubt
[01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:15.940]   that Meg is eavesdropping somewhere close by.
[01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:20.780]   Adanna stood, and the quiet conversations that had whispered amongst the ruined walls hushed.
[01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:26.380]   "We are leaving Dunkrin," she said, without any preamble.
[01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:31.940]   Above her, Kraft ruffled his feathers. "Leaving?" he called quietly.
[01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:36.380]   "Our warriors' kin have only just returned," Rust objected.
[01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:40.660]   "Not even dried their feet, and this is a good defensible spot."
[01:36:40.660 --> 01:36:44.020]   There were rumbles of assent.
[01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:46.820]   "After our victory, they don't want to leave.
[01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:49.140]   I've seen it before.
[01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:54.820]   Victory makes them feel secure, but our enemies no fool, rins as canny as they come.
[01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:58.740]   We'll not defeat her here again," Ernie had said as much to Adanna.
[01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:03.660]   "I agree," Adanna said. "We won the last skirmish.
[01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:07.940]   Rin and her battle-chiefs underestimated us and did not scout well enough.
[01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:12.260]   But they will not repeat that mistake, and they will be back.
[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:17.060]   We faced over five hundred swords, put more than three hundred in their cairns, but however
[01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:20.340]   many we slew, some escaped.
[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:24.620]   They know where we are, and they will report back to Rin.
[01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:29.140]   Next time they will be cautious, and Rin rules four realms now.
[01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:34.060]   She has the numbers to keep throwing warriors at us until we are overwhelmed," Andathrin
[01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:36.100]   nodded dowry in agreement.
[01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:39.260]   "But where else is there?"
[01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:43.900]   "There are one or two other spots in these marshes," Rust said.
[01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:47.980]   "Not as good as here, but still.
[01:37:47.980 --> 01:37:52.180]   We need to change our tactics.
[01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:55.580]   Only the families are staying in the marshes," Adanna interrupted.
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:58.900]   "I'm leading the warband out into Arden."
[01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:00.780]   "Arden?"
[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:02.900]   Kraft muttered above Adanna.
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:04.260]   He didn't look pleased.
[01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:06.620]   The feathers of his neck suddenly bristling.
[01:38:06.620 --> 01:38:07.620]   "What?"
[01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:08.620]   Andathrin blurted.
[01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:14.540]   "Now that is," he paused, face turning redder as he made an obvious effort to master his
[01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:16.820]   tongue, "unwise."
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:21.220]   "We cannot win the war hiding in these marshes."
[01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:28.140]   "If Rin is to be defeated, and Arden, Navon, and Dowen set free, then we must take the
[01:38:28.140 --> 01:38:30.340]   battle to her.
[01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:33.340]   We must become an enemy she fears."
[01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:38.140]   "Winning one battle does not decide the war," Rust said.
[01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:42.220]   "You've done well, but we could lead Rin a merry dance around these marshes."
[01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:48.700]   "I know full well that the war is not won," Adanna said, her voice abruptly cold.
[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:50.980]   "Do not patronize me.
[01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:55.980]   I am not a bairn, and I am no stranger to loss and hardship."
[01:38:55.980 --> 01:38:57.700]   She looked around at them all.
[01:38:57.700 --> 01:39:00.260]   "Each night I close my eyes.
[01:39:00.260 --> 01:39:03.380]   Each day I awake I see the same thing.
[01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:04.380]   My dead kin.
[01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:05.380]   My friends.
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:06.380]   Cut down.
[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:07.380]   My home.
[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:08.380]   Burning.
[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:09.380]   My people."
[01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:12.700]   "Who cares for them while we are here?"
[01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:15.740]   "Never forget what Rin has taken from us.
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:18.860]   It is time we took something back.
[01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:22.740]   It is time we took the battle to her."
[01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:24.060]   Rust snorted.
[01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:28.500]   "We cannot face Rin in open battle," Pindathrin growled.
[01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:30.740]   "Of course not," Adanna said.
[01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:35.780]   "We are too few in numbers, less than two hundred swords, but we can use that to our
[01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:36.780]   advantage.
[01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:43.220]   We can move quickly, strike fast, disappear, strike elsewhere, show Rin and the people
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:47.100]   of Arden that we have teeth."
[01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:49.620]   Pindathrin nodded, obviously considering it.
[01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:53.700]   "That'll only last so long," he said.
[01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:59.220]   "Indeed," Adanna said, "which is why the word needs to spread that Rin has lost a great
[01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:02.820]   battle that her regent Evnes is dead."
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:06.060]   Her eyes flitted to Von, and she took a deep breath.
[01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:10.820]   "That the rightful queen of Arden has returned.
[01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:14.180]   The people need to know they've not been forgotten.
[01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:15.700]   I know them.
[01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:19.540]   They will join us if we offer them hope."
[01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:21.700]   Pindathrin glanced at Rust.
[01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:24.780]   They shared a long silence, then Rust nodded grimly.
[01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:30.700]   "When did the girly I used to bounce upon my knee become this daring battle chief I see
[01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:32.460]   before me?"
[01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:33.460]   Pindathrin said.
[01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:39.660]   Adanna just smiled, though her eyes flickered in acknowledgement to Kamlin and Halleon,
[01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:43.900]   who had had long conversations with her, discussing the options.
[01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:48.180]   So to be fair, much of this plan came from her.
[01:40:48.180 --> 01:40:53.620]   There was a flapping of wings and Krafft glided down to a light on the rock beside Adanna.
[01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:56.140]   "Drasil?" he croaked.
[01:40:56.140 --> 01:41:01.220]   "I am afraid we are not going to Drasil," Adanna said solemnly to the crow.
[01:41:01.220 --> 01:41:02.220]   "Wrong!
[01:41:02.220 --> 01:41:03.220]   Wrong!
[01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:04.220]   Wrong!"
[01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:09.580]   Krafft called, flapping his wings vehemently muttering, "Godwall!
[01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:13.860]   My treasures! Brina! Corbin!" over and over.
[01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:19.180]   "We are needed here, Kraff," Adanna said, reaching out her hand tentatively to touch
[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:21.740]   the crow's ruffled feathers.
[01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:27.780]   He looked at her then with a disgusted squawk flapped into the air and soared away.
[01:41:27.780 --> 01:41:32.860]   Adanna watched him for a few moments, a dark smudge that faded quickly.
[01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:35.540]   Kamlin followed Adanna from the clearing.
[01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:40.100]   The sun was dipping behind the trees. A smell of cooking from the lakeshore wafting over
[01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:41.900]   made Kamlin's belly grumble.
[01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:47.100]   "What are you planning on doing with the plunder on the lakeshore?" he asked Adanna,
[01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:48.860]   as he drew up alongside her.
[01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:53.940]   "Taking what we need? Dumping the rest in the lake so that Rin can't use it," Adanna
[01:41:53.940 --> 01:41:54.940]   replied.
[01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:59.940]   "Make sure you keep the cloaks of black and gold," Kamlin said. "Think they might come
[01:41:59.940 --> 01:42:00.940]   in handy?"
[01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:06.620]   "I had thought exactly the same thing," Adanna said with a vicious smile.
[01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:14.900]   "My lady," a voice said behind them. It was Von, his expression pensive. They halted to
[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:17.260]   let him catch up.
[01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:20.740]   "Kraff? The things he said?"
[01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:27.340]   "I miss our friends as much as he does," Adanna sighed impatiently, interrupting.
[01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:31.940]   "Corbin, Brynner, Dath, Gar, the others."
[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:34.580]   She fell silent, eyes distant.
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:42.580]   "But, much as I long to see them all again, I cannot dash off on a fool's errand to Drassil.
[01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:46.220]   The journey alone would take half a year, and I have a duty to my people."
[01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:50.060]   "You misunderstand me," Von said.
[01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:56.260]   "It is the other things," he said, "about the God-War, about Drassil, and—"
[01:42:56.260 --> 01:43:02.380]   He took a deep breath. "I need to talk to you about what my father told me before he died."
[01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:06.740]   "About what?" Adanna said.
[01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:17.780]   "About the seven treasures," Von said quietly. "I think I know where one of them is."
[01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:19.860]   Chapter 7
[01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:22.020]   Coraline
[01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:27.940]   Then crouched beside Brynner and watched the healer run her hands over Storm's torso.
[01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:32.380]   The wolfen had closed her eyes again, her breathing so shallow that she appeared dead.
[01:43:32.380 --> 01:43:37.820]   But as Brynner's fingers probed Storm's ribs, there was a faint growl and the flash of teeth.
[01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:40.300]   A storm curled her lip.
[01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:43.940]   "That hurts, then?" Brynner murmured.
[01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:49.660]   "Sorry, my darling," she soothed, fingers lifting her lip to look at the colour of Storm's
[01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:54.300]   dumbs, opening an eyelid, lifting legs and bending them at the joints.
[01:43:54.300 --> 01:44:02.380]   "It must be bad. Brynner never calls anyone, my darling, even if they've lost body parts."
[01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:07.060]   Coraline looked up, hearing voices from beyond the ridge. "Gah," organising a search of the
[01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:09.340]   area.
[01:44:09.340 --> 01:44:13.300]   While desperate to go and help continue the search for Coraline, worried that the others
[01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:17.540]   might miss something, she still couldn't bear to leave Storm's side.
[01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:22.100]   "Can you help her?" Coraline whispered.
[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:24.620]   Brynner ignored her.
[01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:29.700]   Eventually she paused, sat straight, her head bowed in thought.
[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:33.420]   She blew out a long breath and nodded, then with a quick movement she pulled out the file
[01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:37.660]   Coraline had seen her scrape Giant's blood into.
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:42.460]   She scooped out some of the congealing blood and muttered as she lifted Storm's lip and
[01:44:42.460 --> 01:44:45.580]   ran her finger across Storm's lolling tongue.
[01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:51.460]   "Fuel, novids, hert schlänte argus niet."
[01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:58.440]   She repeated the phrase again and again, gently massaging Storm's throat to help her swallow.
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:03.420]   The air seemed to grow chill about them and Coraline shivered, feeling as if a spider had
[01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:06.760]   just crawled the length of her spine.
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:12.780]   Eventually Storm shuddered, a spasm that rippled through her whole body.
[01:45:12.780 --> 01:45:16.580]   Storm was not sure if it was wishful thinking, but the wolven's breathing seemed to become
[01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:20.200]   stronger, steadier.
[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:21.700]   Brynner stopped and looked at Coraline.
[01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:24.620]   "What have you done?"
[01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:25.620]   Coraline whispered.
[01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:28.500]   "Not a word to anyone."
[01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:31.620]   Brynner hissed fiercely, eyes locking onto Coraline's.
[01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:38.380]   "Without it, she is dead, she is too far gone, even now I cannot say."
[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:43.540]   Coraline's heart dropped down beside them, his usually emotionless face twisted with concern.
[01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:49.140]   "Well?" he said, looking between Brynner and the wolven.
[01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:54.020]   Brynner held Coraline's eyes still, waiting.
[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:58.500]   Coraline gave an imperceptible nod and then Brynner sighed and shook her head.
[01:45:58.500 --> 01:46:00.740]   "I don't know.
[01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:06.540]   She is battered, ribs broken, one lung punctured and collapsed.
[01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:11.540]   There is a hole through her shoulder and into her chest the size of my fist.
[01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:17.460]   If none of these things ends us still, the loss of blood might," she shrugged.
[01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:19.140]   Her spirits strong.
[01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:22.180]   "None stronger," Gar said.
[01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:26.500]   "Aye, that may give her a chance," Brynner said.
[01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:28.660]   "Can she be moved?"
[01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:29.660]   Gar asked.
[01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:30.660]   "No."
[01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:32.420]   "I'll set a guard.
[01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:34.780]   Coraline, I need your eyes in the search for Corbin."
[01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:38.620]   Coraline nodded.
[01:46:38.620 --> 01:46:41.340]   She brushed her fingertips across Storm's muzzle.
[01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:47.620]   She had a lingering look with Brynner and then she was hauling herself up the ridge.
[01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:51.980]   Coraline stood staring at the corpse of the great bear, for a moment speechless.
[01:46:51.980 --> 01:46:57.540]   It was huge, swiced the height of a horse and three times as wide.
[01:46:57.540 --> 01:47:03.220]   The bear was a patchwork of wounds, a great flap of flesh hung loose above its shoulder
[01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:05.900]   more a tear than a cut.
[01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:11.020]   Half the length of its side had been opened with what looked like a sword cut, ribs shattered
[01:47:11.020 --> 01:47:15.340]   and flakes of white bones sprinkled amongst the red ruin.
[01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:21.140]   "Corbin," Coraline said as she pointed to the sword wound in the bear's side.
[01:47:21.140 --> 01:47:26.660]   "That's not what killed it," Farrell said, pointing away from the gaping slash in the
[01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:28.220]   bear's side.
[01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:30.100]   "That is."
[01:47:30.100 --> 01:47:34.540]   The bear's throat had been opened, the flesh lacerated and hanging.
[01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:38.420]   They'd all seen that type of wound before.
[01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:41.100]   "Storm," Gar said.
[01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:47.460]   "This is where we found them," Pack said, his voice raw with grief.
[01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:49.980]   "Where dar spear the giant?"
[01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:53.420]   "Describe this giant," Gar said.
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:48:01.140]   Fair-haired, the colour of fresh straw, a war hammer, he looked, reekle, in charge, and
[01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:02.660]   he was talking to Corbin.
[01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:05.820]   "Could it be Ildar?"
[01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:08.020]   Laith said.
[01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:11.860]   Coraline felt a pulse of anger at the name, saw Gar stiffen.
[01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:15.460]   Ildar was the warlord of the jutton.
[01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:20.580]   He had slain Tuckle, Gar's father, at Graham's hold and broken Gar's ribs when he had tried
[01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:23.620]   to avenge his dar's death.
[01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:27.860]   The ground showed the signs of more bears, at least another four, maybe more, as well
[01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:31.300]   as other giants on foot.
[01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:34.780]   Tracks led northwards into the forest away from Drassil.
[01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:40.740]   Ildar and the jutton had fought alongside Jael of Izeltyr, who in turn was allied to
[01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:47.300]   Nefaire, so the logical conclusion was that the jutton would have taken Corbin to Drassil,
[01:48:47.300 --> 01:48:49.780]   who would have joined the battle.
[01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:51.540]   That's their tracks headed north.
[01:48:51.540 --> 01:48:54.340]   "Where are they going?"
[01:48:54.340 --> 01:48:56.260]   Coraline asked.
[01:48:56.260 --> 01:49:00.260]   Dath moved first, breaking the spell the dead bear had put upon them.
[01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:06.180]   "Don't know, but we won't find them or a band by standing here," he said.
[01:49:06.180 --> 01:49:08.340]   "When did this happen?"
[01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:09.340]   Gar asked.
[01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:12.820]   "Yesterday, after High Sun," Pax replied.
[01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:16.940]   "We've seen no sign of a camp," Coraline said.
[01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:21.660]   "No, cook fires, nowhere slept upon, little spore.
[01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:26.140]   My guess is that they set off after capturing Corbin, so there must have been enough light
[01:49:26.140 --> 01:49:28.320]   to make a good start.
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:32.620]   If we follow their trail, see how much ground they covered before making camp, we'll get
[01:49:32.620 --> 01:49:36.700]   a better idea of how far ahead of us they are."
[01:49:36.700 --> 01:49:41.920]   Gar grunted in agreement, and together they moved up a steep slope, entering an area of
[01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:44.740]   dense vegetation.
[01:49:44.740 --> 01:49:50.380]   The hill levelled out and opened up, sunshine breaking through the canopy above.
[01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:56.820]   It was past High Sun, the day beginning its slow crawl towards night.
[01:49:56.820 --> 01:50:02.780]   To the south, Coraline could see Drassil, pillars of smoke spiralling from it.
[01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:06.100]   She looked back to the hill she was standing on, at the bare and giant tracks that led
[01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:10.100]   down the hill north away from Drassil.
[01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:14.540]   The sound of movement drew Coraline's attention, a rustling.
[01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:18.700]   Immediately her sword was in her fist, and she was seeking cover, the others following
[01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:22.340]   suit, dath with an arrow knocked.
[01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:25.900]   Laith pulled one of her throwing knives, as big as a sword, from the leather belt strapped
[01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:28.140]   across her chest.
[01:50:28.140 --> 01:50:34.100]   Gar signalled to the jihar before, and behind them, and then they waited.
[01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:39.140]   Beyond the peak of the hill, the forest was shrouded in shadow, hindering Coraline's
[01:50:39.140 --> 01:50:43.320]   vision, but the crunch of forest litter and approaching rustle amongst the foliage spoke
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:45.140]   of many feet.
[01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:52.180]   A figure appeared, crouched, moving carefully, dark shadows taking form behind it.
[01:50:52.180 --> 01:50:54.180]   Iron glinted.
[01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:58.060]   Then Gar was stepping from behind a tree, sheathing his sword and striding down the
[01:50:58.060 --> 01:50:59.060]   hill.
[01:50:59.060 --> 01:51:07.660]   "Well, Matt," he said to Tahir, "the Shieldman of Halen, boy-king of Izeltir."
[01:51:07.660 --> 01:51:13.180]   The warrior gave a lopsided grin of relief and took Gar's forearm in the warrior grip.
[01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:17.420]   He was not overly tall, but was broad and thick-muscled, his arms looking too long for
[01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:19.900]   his body.
[01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:25.140]   Dark hollows ringed his eyes, and there was a long tear across the shoulder of his chain-mail
[01:51:25.140 --> 01:51:27.500]   shirt, blood caked around it.
[01:51:27.500 --> 01:51:31.300]   "Been looking for you," Tahir said.
[01:51:31.300 --> 01:51:34.060]   "And you found us," Gar said.
[01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:37.540]   "How did you know where to search?"
[01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:41.580]   One of my lads saw Michael defending the door to the northern tunnel.
[01:51:41.580 --> 01:51:45.580]   "You don't defend a door for nothing."
[01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:51.540]   We retreated out of the main gate, made it to the forest, and started circling this way.
[01:51:51.540 --> 01:51:56.780]   More men appeared behind him, forty, fifty, others hidden in the forest gloom, most wearing
[01:51:56.780 --> 01:51:59.660]   the red cloaks of Izeltir.
[01:51:59.660 --> 01:52:05.380]   Taking us all night and half the day, Forest was crawling with Kadoshim and Vint Halen.
[01:52:05.380 --> 01:52:09.980]   "Think we've taught them to fear the forest better, though."
[01:52:09.980 --> 01:52:12.780]   A rumble of agreement spread through the warriors behind him.
[01:52:12.780 --> 01:52:14.780]   "Where's Halen?"
[01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:17.300]   Gar asked, and Tahir's face dropped.
[01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:18.980]   "I don't know.
[01:52:18.980 --> 01:52:21.380]   I tried to find him."
[01:52:21.380 --> 01:52:24.260]   Tahir's mouth twisted with something between pain and shame.
[01:52:24.260 --> 01:52:27.380]   "He's a resourceful lad," Gar said.
[01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:29.820]   "I'd wager he's found a hole to hide in."
[01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:33.700]   "I hope so," Tahir replied, a tremor in his voice.
[01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:35.820]   "How many were you?"
[01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:41.940]   Gar asked him. "Hundred and forty-six swords that can fight," Tahir said, "another dozen
[01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:42.940]   wounded."
[01:52:42.940 --> 01:52:46.860]   "You've done well, saving so many," Gar said.
[01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:48.500]   "Aye, well.
[01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:53.020]   Slow and steady wins the race, as my old man used to say."
[01:52:53.020 --> 01:52:54.020]   Tahir looked around.
[01:52:54.020 --> 01:52:55.020]   "Where's Corbin?"
[01:52:55.020 --> 01:52:56.020]   "Taken.
[01:52:56.020 --> 01:52:57.020]   By the Jotun.
[01:52:57.020 --> 01:53:01.420]   We have just found his trail."
[01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:03.340]   Tahir scowled and spat.
[01:53:03.340 --> 01:53:06.980]   "Giants," he muttered, then looked back to Gar.
[01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:11.300]   "So, what do we do now?"
[01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:13.300]   Gar looked at him and blinked.
[01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:18.380]   "With Corbin and Mike Halgon, Gar is our natural leader now.
[01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:21.500]   And not just for us, but for all who fought at Drassil.
[01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:25.620]   He is lord of the Jaar and Corbin's first sword.
[01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:31.460]   All Corbin wanted to do was find Corbin, but with survivors scattered throughout the forest
[01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:33.180]   Gar had more to consider.
[01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:40.900]   "I am going after Corbin," Gar said, and turned away to stare at the trail that led northwards.
[01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:42.180]   Tahir gripped his arm.
[01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:44.180]   "What about us?"
[01:53:44.180 --> 01:53:45.180]   he asked.
[01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:50.940]   "You and your warriors will rest a while, drink, eat, tend to your wounds."
[01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:56.540]   "I don't just mean us," Tahir said, waving a hand at his men.
[01:53:56.540 --> 01:54:00.260]   "I mean, the warband of Drassil.
[01:54:00.260 --> 01:54:03.740]   Many still live, can you not hear them still fighting?
[01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:08.380]   For Corbin, you cannot just abandon them."
[01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:12.500]   Gar stared at him, face twitching.
[01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:16.940]   Corbin crouched beside the burned-out fire and brushed the ash with her fingers.
[01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:22.740]   It was cold, not even the memory of heat lingering within it.
[01:54:22.740 --> 01:54:28.980]   She glanced up, saw a daft at the edge of shadow poking at a mound of bare dung.
[01:54:28.980 --> 01:54:30.500]   It was sunset.
[01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:33.940]   The forest was slipping into layers of shadow.
[01:54:33.940 --> 01:54:38.500]   After talking with Tahir, Gar had sent out scouts to see if the survivors of Drassil
[01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:41.380]   could be brought together.
[01:54:41.380 --> 01:54:46.260]   Corbin had left with Dath and Collar to find the giant's camp.
[01:54:46.260 --> 01:54:52.340]   She sprang up and ran from the site, easily following the path the giants had left.
[01:54:52.340 --> 01:54:56.620]   They are overly confident, making no effort to hide their passage.
[01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:59.180]   They would not think that we were hunting them.
[01:54:59.180 --> 01:55:00.740]   If only I could reach them.
[01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:03.740]   It may be possible to steal Corbin back in the darkness.
[01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:06.980]   "It's too dark, we'll lose their trail."
[01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:12.540]   Dath called after her, but she ignored him, just ran on into the forest, following the
[01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:15.540]   tracks up a steep incline.
[01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:21.540]   She climbed it and stopped, kicking at a moss-covered stone, her heart sinking as she realised the
[01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:24.380]   implications of what she could see.
[01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:28.340]   "The old giants rode," she said to Dath and Collar, as they joined her.
[01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:30.820]   It had been rebuilt by J.L.'s warband.
[01:55:30.820 --> 01:55:32.340]   "And they're moving fast."
[01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:34.780]   "Aye," Collar said.
[01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:39.380]   "Wherever they're going, they want to get there quickly and are not worried about any
[01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:40.380]   pursuit."
[01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:46.180]   "Probably think we're all a bit busy with Nithair and Drassil," Dath added.
[01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:47.180]   He looked at Corbin.
[01:55:47.180 --> 01:55:50.020]   "How far ahead do you think they are?"
[01:55:50.020 --> 01:55:52.340]   "A day," Corbin grunted.
[01:55:52.340 --> 01:55:56.460]   "If they stick to that ruined road, maybe ten, twelve leagues?"
[01:55:56.460 --> 01:56:00.340]   "Wouldn't I catch them this night, then?"
[01:56:00.340 --> 01:56:02.300]   Corbin sucked in a long breath.
[01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:03.780]   "No," she growled.
[01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:06.220]   "What do you want to do?"
[01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:07.220]   Dath asked her.
[01:56:07.220 --> 01:56:12.820]   "I want to keep running, keep moving until we find them, find him.
[01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:15.300]   But there would be no quick rescue now.
[01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:18.940]   They would be fortunate to catch them in half a ten-night.
[01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:21.660]   Probably longer if their bears have an open run.
[01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:24.740]   Back to Gar," she said.
[01:56:24.740 --> 01:56:28.940]   They had made it back to camping good time, considering they were travelling almost blind,
[01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:34.060]   the moonlight little more than a shimmer above the forest canopy.
[01:56:34.060 --> 01:56:38.380]   Warriors were everywhere, clustered around small fires that had been surrounded by wicker
[01:56:38.380 --> 01:56:41.100]   panels to hide their glow.
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:44.620]   Corbin saw Gar standing beside a larger fire with a group around him.
[01:56:44.620 --> 01:56:49.180]   Tahir was there as well as others whom she was pleased to see.
[01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:53.820]   She had seen the wolf in his bear pelt, her notched axe resting across his shoulder.
[01:56:53.820 --> 01:57:00.420]   Javed, the pit fighter, small and wiry, a giant outline behind them.
[01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:04.660]   Gar saw her enter the glade and their eyes met.
[01:57:04.660 --> 01:57:08.500]   Corbin nodded, signaling that she'd found the giant's camp.
[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:10.860]   "We shall strike.
[01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:13.100]   Attack Drasil now," Javed said.
[01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:15.460]   "They'd not be expecting that.
[01:57:15.460 --> 01:57:17.860]   The Vintalan are in there."
[01:57:17.860 --> 01:57:20.860]   There was a belly-contained rage edging his voice.
[01:57:20.860 --> 01:57:26.220]   "Like us is there, the man who gave me this."
[01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:30.700]   He twisted to show the scar burned into the back of his shoulder, a twisting spiral.
[01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:39.660]   "He and his kind did this and worse to many of us," Javed said, waving a hand at his warriors.
[01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:41.660]   Angry murmurs spread amongst them.
[01:57:41.660 --> 01:57:46.940]   "Kick a stone in anger, you'll hurt your foot," Tahir said.
[01:57:46.940 --> 01:57:49.900]   Javed just stared at him.
[01:57:49.900 --> 01:57:53.700]   The giant behind them laughed, a low rumbling like drums.
[01:57:53.700 --> 01:57:58.380]   "Just something my old ma'am used to say," Tahir muttered.
[01:57:58.380 --> 01:58:01.260]   "And what the hell does it mean?"
[01:58:01.260 --> 01:58:02.260]   Javed scowled.
[01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:06.460]   "That acting from anger will get you killed," Gar said.
[01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:09.460]   "Anger is the enemy."
[01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:11.580]   He turned to the group close to him.
[01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:14.620]   "Fakan of the Banothi," Gar continued.
[01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:18.220]   "What would your clan advise?"
[01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:22.900]   The giant stepped forwards into the firelight, a double-bladed axe silhouetted across his
[01:58:22.900 --> 01:58:24.300]   shoulder.
[01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:30.300]   "Baller Wanai is wounded on the edge of life and death.
[01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:32.760]   Ethelyn will not leave him.
[01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:36.540]   We will not fight without her."
[01:58:36.540 --> 01:58:37.860]   Gar nodded thoughtfully.
[01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:41.140]   "How many of your kin are with you?"
[01:58:41.140 --> 01:58:46.820]   "A score. perhaps more are scattered in fawn," the giant shrugged.
[01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:50.300]   "I will send Brynna with you when you return to them."
[01:58:50.300 --> 01:58:51.300]   "Good."
[01:58:51.300 --> 01:58:54.900]   "Ethelyn bad me ask for her."
[01:58:54.900 --> 01:58:58.220]   "We cannot just do nothing," Javed snapped.
[01:58:58.220 --> 01:59:02.860]   "I do not intend to do nothing," Gar said.
[01:59:02.860 --> 01:59:09.580]   Other voices joined in, each proposing a different way forward, attacks, ambushes, strategies.
[01:59:09.580 --> 01:59:12.260]   Things could go on all night.
[01:59:12.260 --> 01:59:17.060]   Kuralyn slipped across the glade, moving beyond the small council to the side of the glade.
[01:59:17.060 --> 01:59:22.260]   A makeshift rope ladder hung over the edge, another fire flickering below by the river's
[01:59:22.260 --> 01:59:24.380]   bank.
[01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:27.540]   Kuralyn climbed nimbly down to find Brynna with Storm.
[01:59:27.540 --> 01:59:33.260]   The Feral was there, too, sitting with his back to the slope, eyes closed, a big hand
[01:59:33.260 --> 01:59:35.220]   resting upon Storm's shoulder.
[01:59:35.220 --> 01:59:37.360]   "How is she?"
[01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:39.360]   Kuralyn asked.
[01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:43.660]   Brynna looked at her with sad eyes, tears glittering in the firelight.
[01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:49.420]   "I fear she will not win this fight," the healer said.
[01:59:49.420 --> 01:59:51.360]   Kuralyn's heart lurched in her chest.
[01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:54.620]   "But she used magic," said a spell.
[01:59:54.620 --> 01:59:56.460]   "But what you did?"
[01:59:56.460 --> 02:00:03.720]   "It has helped," Brynna said, giving her strength, but her wounds.
[02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:07.500]   She looked at Feral, then lowered her voice to little more than a whisper.
[02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:11.440]   "And I used Giant's blood.
[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:15.540]   Another wolfen or something closer to her own species would have more power."
[02:00:15.540 --> 02:00:20.380]   "There is a dead bear, half a league from here?"
[02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:21.380]   Kuralyn said.
[02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:25.040]   "One of those that jot and Giant's ride."
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:28.340]   Brynna reached into her cloak and removed an empty file.
[02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:34.900]   "Feel this with its blood," she said, taking Kuralyn's hand and closing her fingers about
[02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:36.500]   it.
[02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:39.820]   Brynna glanced at Storm, at the wolfen's shallow breathing.
[02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:45.260]   "And be quick about it," Kuralyn was.
[02:00:45.260 --> 02:00:48.860]   Most of the camp was sleeping when she returned from her Christi task.
[02:00:48.860 --> 02:00:53.820]   Gar and the other leaders were still in deep conversation.
[02:00:53.820 --> 02:00:58.900]   Brynna was alone with Storm, the small fire crackling, casting shadows across the healer
[02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:01.460]   and wolfen.
[02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:07.900]   Once a word, Brynna took the file, and massaged the fluid into Storm's gums and tongue.
[02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:16.380]   "Dwil, novit, alart, a slandargus nyart," Brynna muttered, over and over, her voice
[02:01:16.380 --> 02:01:20.860]   sounding like a stick scratching on sleight.
[02:01:20.860 --> 02:01:23.020]   Kuralyn's flesh goosebumped.
[02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:28.140]   The fire seemed to dim and then flare, a twig popped.
[02:01:28.140 --> 02:01:32.780]   The wolfen stirred, lifting her head to regard Brynna with her amber wolfen eyes.
[02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:36.380]   "Come back to us," Brynna whispered.
[02:01:36.380 --> 02:01:39.460]   "Corbin needs you."
[02:01:39.460 --> 02:01:43.580]   Storm's legs twitched and she gave a weak rumbling growl, then with a sigh she laid
[02:01:43.580 --> 02:01:45.540]   her head back on the turf.
[02:01:45.540 --> 02:01:51.540]   "Thank you," Brynna said to Kuralyn, looking weary.
[02:01:51.540 --> 02:01:56.660]   Dirts skidded about them, and dath, colour and lath appeared out of the darkness, waking
[02:01:56.660 --> 02:01:57.660]   Pharrell.
[02:01:57.660 --> 02:01:59.660]   "How is she?"
[02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:00.660]   Dath asked.
[02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:03.660]   "A little stronger," Brynna said.
[02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:07.660]   "We'll take it in turns to watch over her," Pharrell said.
[02:02:07.660 --> 02:02:09.220]   "Even you must need to sleep."
[02:02:09.220 --> 02:02:15.740]   "Well, for once you may be right," Brynna muttered.
[02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:19.060]   She curled down beside the fire, pulling her cloak over her head.
[02:02:19.060 --> 02:02:22.580]   "Wake me if there is any change.
[02:02:22.580 --> 02:02:26.620]   And no going to sleep on watch."
[02:02:26.620 --> 02:02:31.380]   A bony finger poked out of the cloak and wagged at them all.
[02:02:31.380 --> 02:02:35.980]   Within moments Brynna's breathing changed, became slower and deeper.
[02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:37.980]   "So?"
[02:02:37.980 --> 02:02:41.540]   Dath whispered to Kuralyn once they were all sure that Brynna was soundly asleep.
[02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:43.460]   "When do we leave?"
[02:02:43.460 --> 02:02:46.100]   "What do you mean?"
[02:02:46.100 --> 02:02:47.100]   Kuralyn asked.
[02:02:47.100 --> 02:02:49.200]   "You'll be going after Corbin.
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:52.020]   We're coming too."
[02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:55.460]   Brynna had decided to leave a little before first light, to slip away before the camp
[02:02:55.460 --> 02:02:58.740]   woke and started asking her questions.
[02:02:58.740 --> 02:03:01.980]   She needed to use every moment of daylight possible.
[02:03:01.980 --> 02:03:06.020]   "Perhaps, leave a message for Gar."
[02:03:06.020 --> 02:03:09.940]   It was clear that he was needed here, that his duties would force him to stay and oversee
[02:03:09.940 --> 02:03:11.860]   the fight against Nathair.
[02:03:11.860 --> 02:03:15.140]   "You can't come," Kuralyn said.
[02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:20.060]   "Pharrell and Laith will be too noisy, too slow."
[02:03:20.060 --> 02:03:21.820]   Kuralyn leaned forwards.
[02:03:21.820 --> 02:03:24.220]   "Bands, my friend.
[02:03:24.220 --> 02:03:25.220]   More than that.
[02:03:25.220 --> 02:03:26.500]   Closer than kin.
[02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:30.020]   I'm going after him with you or without you," he shrugged.
[02:03:30.020 --> 02:03:35.140]   "I'd rather we travel together, but I'll not be staying here."
[02:03:35.140 --> 02:03:38.060]   Kuralyn looked at them all, saw the resolve in their eyes.
[02:03:38.060 --> 02:03:43.020]   "All right, then," she said, before dawn.
[02:03:43.020 --> 02:03:48.500]   Morning came gray and damp, false dawn giving a half-light that helped Kuralyn to see beyond
[02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:53.820]   the fire glow they'd kept crackling all night to give Storm a little warmth.
[02:03:53.820 --> 02:04:01.580]   Pharrell, Dath, Kuralyn and Laith had all stayed, taking it in terms to watch over Storm.
[02:04:01.580 --> 02:04:07.780]   Now, silently, they all stood, checked weapons and packs.
[02:04:07.780 --> 02:04:14.220]   "I would come with you if not for Storm," Bryn said as she stirred within her cloak.
[02:04:14.220 --> 02:04:17.540]   "We know," Kuralyn answered.
[02:04:17.540 --> 02:04:20.540]   Brynner checked on the sleeping wolfen.
[02:04:20.540 --> 02:04:23.980]   "Her heart beats stronger," she said.
[02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:29.100]   "That is good news," Kuralyn grinned.
[02:04:29.100 --> 02:04:33.300]   She crouched beside the wolfen and ran her fingers through the thick fur of her neck,
[02:04:33.300 --> 02:04:36.660]   then leaned forwards and kissed Storm's head.
[02:04:36.660 --> 02:04:40.740]   "I'll be back with Corbin," she whispered.
[02:04:40.740 --> 02:04:45.620]   "Bring him back," Brynner said, watching them leave.
[02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:49.780]   "I mean to, or die in a trying."
[02:04:49.780 --> 02:04:53.180]   The camp in the glade above was still and silent.
[02:04:53.180 --> 02:04:57.020]   Kuralyn and the others picked their way through the sleeping figures.
[02:04:57.020 --> 02:05:01.380]   As they slipped amongst the trees, a figure stepped out in front of them.
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:02.380]   "Gah!"
[02:05:02.380 --> 02:05:07.460]   He had a pack slung across his back, a grim look upon his face.
[02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:10.700]   He nodded as he looked fiercely at the small gathering.
[02:05:10.700 --> 02:05:11.700]   "Good.
[02:05:11.700 --> 02:05:14.660]   Let's be after him, then."
[02:05:14.660 --> 02:05:20.300]   "We thought you were needed here that you would have to stay," Kuralyn said.
[02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:22.060]   He gave her a withering look.
[02:05:22.060 --> 02:05:29.500]   "Only death would stop me going after Ban."
[02:05:29.500 --> 02:05:34.140]   Chapter 8 Corbin
[02:05:34.140 --> 02:05:36.400]   Corbin woke to pain.
[02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:42.700]   He opened his eyes, stared up at a dappled canopy of leaf and branch, gray light leaking
[02:05:42.700 --> 02:05:44.580]   through it.
[02:05:44.580 --> 02:05:48.420]   It was passing him by, like clouds scudding across the sky.
[02:05:48.420 --> 02:05:50.500]   "No, not the trees.
[02:05:50.500 --> 02:05:58.420]   It is I that am moving, and I am in fawn," he realized, "still in fawn."
[02:05:58.420 --> 02:06:00.820]   He felt relief at that.
[02:06:00.820 --> 02:06:03.220]   Being in fawn was not such a bad thing.
[02:06:03.220 --> 02:06:07.300]   He liked the forest, and it also meant that he was not a thousand leagues from Drassil
[02:06:07.300 --> 02:06:11.300]   and his friends, if any of them had survived.
[02:06:11.300 --> 02:06:15.940]   But the constant rocking, bumping motion wasn't such a good thing, making his chest spike
[02:06:15.940 --> 02:06:21.020]   with pain and exacerbating the deep, dull throb in his knee, pulsing out in time with
[02:06:21.020 --> 02:06:22.420]   his heartbeat.
[02:06:22.420 --> 02:06:31.100]   Also, there was a terrible stink in his nose, musky and stale, making him want to gag.
[02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:33.760]   Time passed in something of a haze.
[02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:37.940]   His mind drifted and he thought to the other world of his meeting with Michael.
[02:06:37.940 --> 02:06:43.140]   He used me, manipulated me, lied to me.
[02:06:43.140 --> 02:06:45.380]   But his words had also rung true.
[02:06:45.380 --> 02:06:48.700]   He needed to find his friends to be at their side.
[02:06:48.700 --> 02:06:50.300]   How?
[02:06:50.300 --> 02:06:52.540]   That is the question.
[02:06:52.540 --> 02:06:58.960]   When I am broken and battered, a prisoner travelling early on knows where.
[02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:03.860]   He moved his head slowly from side to side, saw that he was on a makeshift litter that
[02:07:03.860 --> 02:07:07.140]   was being dragged through the forest.
[02:07:07.140 --> 02:07:12.760]   Behind him, a huge figure loomed, thick with fur, a black snout and muzzle yellowed teeth
[02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:14.820]   edging its jaw.
[02:07:14.820 --> 02:07:16.700]   A bear.
[02:07:16.700 --> 02:07:19.540]   One of the Jotun's bears.
[02:07:19.540 --> 02:07:24.660]   Their face reared over him, pale and blonde-haired, along braided moustards drooping down almost
[02:07:24.660 --> 02:07:27.260]   to Corbin's face.
[02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:30.860]   Corbin recognised him as one of the giants that had dragged him away from storm.
[02:07:30.860 --> 02:07:36.980]   "I'll kill you," Corbin hissed, instinctively reaching for his sword.
[02:07:36.980 --> 02:07:42.340]   When his fingers reached the empty scabbard, he remembered that he'd left it in the body
[02:07:42.340 --> 02:07:47.260]   of a giant, back in the glade where he and Storm had fought and slain three of this giant's
[02:07:47.260 --> 02:07:49.580]   kin.
[02:07:49.580 --> 02:07:53.940]   The giant's eyes watched Corbin's gasping breathlessness and grunted.
[02:07:53.940 --> 02:08:01.020]   "You'll not be killing any more of us, Jotun, today," the giant said in stilted speech.
[02:08:01.020 --> 02:08:05.780]   "But I like your spirit," he chuckled.
[02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:09.500]   "There's fire in this pup's belly, yet."
[02:08:09.500 --> 02:08:12.260]   "Hala!" he called over his shoulder.
[02:08:12.260 --> 02:08:15.060]   "Seems you'll make a healer after all."
[02:08:15.060 --> 02:08:22.900]   "I've been one for four hundred years, you idiot," a voice called back.
[02:08:22.900 --> 02:08:27.340]   The giant looked back at Corbin and checked the binding of his leg splint, sending jolts
[02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:29.220]   of pain through Corbin.
[02:08:29.220 --> 02:08:34.220]   "Don't go dying on us," the giant said.
[02:08:34.220 --> 02:08:38.340]   Another giant face appeared beside it, this one, red-haired and glowering.
[02:08:38.340 --> 02:08:44.420]   "He and his wolf and kils are on, Ralph and Lott," it rumbled, reaching round with the
[02:08:44.420 --> 02:08:49.020]   hand the size of a shovel and cuffing Corbin across the head.
[02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:52.580]   Just the blow was painful enough, but the fire it ignited in Corbin's chest was like
[02:08:52.580 --> 02:08:57.140]   a hammer strike and he screamed, the world fading to darkness.
[02:08:57.140 --> 02:09:02.420]   The last sound he heard was giant voices yelling at each other.
[02:09:02.420 --> 02:09:07.160]   "Drink this," a voice said.
[02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:11.780]   Something was shoved into his hand a bowl and to his surprise he found that he was propped
[02:09:11.780 --> 02:09:17.820]   up against the trunk of a tree, a rope tying him to the wide bowl, not that I can get up
[02:09:17.820 --> 02:09:19.920]   and run away.
[02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:26.060]   Two giants were crouched before him, both of them cloaked in a twilight gloom of fawn.
[02:09:26.060 --> 02:09:29.700]   One of them was the blonde giant he talked to earlier.
[02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:34.500]   From them, he heard the familiar sound of camp-making, shadowy figures moving at the
[02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:36.580]   edge of his sight.
[02:09:36.580 --> 02:09:44.500]   "Drink," the voice said, a huge hand wrapping around his and lifting the bowl to his lips.
[02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:49.420]   Corbin sniffed it, wrinkling his nose with a familiar, earthly smell.
[02:09:49.420 --> 02:09:56.940]   "Brot," he muttered, "You know, Brot?" the voice said in surprise.
[02:09:56.940 --> 02:10:01.420]   Corbin looked into the gloom and saw that one of the dark figures before him was a woman,
[02:10:01.420 --> 02:10:06.900]   her face slabs of bone highlighted by the dim gleam of moonlight.
[02:10:06.900 --> 02:10:09.380]   "Aye," Corbin mumbled.
[02:10:09.380 --> 02:10:12.420]   He sniffed suspiciously at the bowl.
[02:10:12.420 --> 02:10:15.260]   "Go on," the voice said.
[02:10:15.260 --> 02:10:18.620]   "If we wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already."
[02:10:18.620 --> 02:10:20.980]   "That's a fair point.
[02:10:20.980 --> 02:10:23.940]   Why haven't they killed me?"
[02:10:23.940 --> 02:10:29.860]   He took a sip, the Brot's closer to porridge inconsistency than fluid.
[02:10:29.860 --> 02:10:33.660]   After swallowing, he felt an aftertaste, something bitter.
[02:10:33.660 --> 02:10:36.980]   "It's not the same," Corbin said.
[02:10:36.980 --> 02:10:37.980]   "As what?"
[02:10:37.980 --> 02:10:40.900]   "As what Balor gave me."
[02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:43.180]   There was a pause.
[02:10:43.180 --> 02:10:45.300]   The giant shared a look.
[02:10:45.300 --> 02:10:50.020]   "Balor, one eye," the blonde-haired male asked.
[02:10:50.020 --> 02:10:54.220]   "Aye," Corbin said, "there's something else in this.
[02:10:54.220 --> 02:10:55.780]   Golden seal."
[02:10:55.780 --> 02:10:56.780]   Another silence.
[02:10:56.780 --> 02:10:59.580]   "Aye," the female giant said.
[02:10:59.580 --> 02:11:01.500]   She almost sounded pleased.
[02:11:01.500 --> 02:11:05.060]   "Golden seal to fight infection," Bryn always said.
[02:11:05.060 --> 02:11:07.220]   "The worse it tastes, the better it is for you."
[02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:11.180]   I never quite believed that bit.
[02:11:11.180 --> 02:11:14.140]   Another figure loomed out of the shadows.
[02:11:14.140 --> 02:11:19.780]   "Bogger," the giant rumbled, and his captors parted to let this one crouch down before
[02:11:19.780 --> 02:11:20.780]   Corbin.
[02:11:20.780 --> 02:11:28.180]   "Airdrum," the new arrival said, and a moment later Corbin heard flint being struck, sparks
[02:11:28.180 --> 02:11:32.380]   catching on a torch and light flared.
[02:11:32.380 --> 02:11:36.140]   Corbin blinked, looked away a moment.
[02:11:36.140 --> 02:11:43.340]   "Look at me," the new voice said, a grating rumble stern and grim.
[02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:46.980]   A hand gripped Corbin's face and lifted his chin.
[02:11:46.980 --> 02:11:50.980]   He was looking at another blonde giant, a thick warrior braid in his hair, threaded
[02:11:50.980 --> 02:11:53.860]   with red-gold wire.
[02:11:53.860 --> 02:11:58.420]   This one had a wide bandage wrapped around his shoulder and chest, a dark stain at its
[02:11:58.420 --> 02:11:59.420]   center.
[02:11:59.420 --> 02:12:05.380]   "You are Ildar, King of the Jotun," Corbin said.
[02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:10.060]   "Warlord, not King," Ildar murmured.
[02:12:10.060 --> 02:12:13.300]   "But who are you?"
[02:12:13.300 --> 02:12:16.780]   "Why am I still breathing?"
[02:12:16.780 --> 02:12:17.780]   Corbin asked.
[02:12:17.780 --> 02:12:23.180]   "I slew your bear, three of your kin in the glade," with a lot of help from Storm.
[02:12:23.180 --> 02:12:25.420]   "Why would you keep me alive?"
[02:12:25.420 --> 02:12:31.620]   "You do not question me," Ildar said.
[02:12:31.620 --> 02:12:35.740]   Then with one thick finger prodded Corbin in his ribs.
[02:12:35.740 --> 02:12:38.220]   Corbin suppressed a scream.
[02:12:38.220 --> 02:12:40.740]   It came out as a gurgled hiss.
[02:12:40.740 --> 02:12:47.180]   Ildar's hand brushed over Corbin's torn surcoat, rested on the sigil of the bright star stitched
[02:12:47.180 --> 02:12:53.320]   upon his chest, felt his male shirt rolling links between his fingers.
[02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:58.820]   He grunted approvingly, then moved on to Corbin's arm ring, wrapped around his bicep.
[02:12:58.820 --> 02:13:03.940]   It had been gifted to him in Drassil, a spiral of dark iron veined with a silver thread,
[02:13:03.940 --> 02:13:07.740]   a snarling wolf and head at each end.
[02:13:07.740 --> 02:13:12.860]   It was a thing of beauty, more so because it reminded Corbin of the night back in Drassil
[02:13:12.860 --> 02:13:17.340]   when the whole of the warband had pledged their loyalty to him and he had sworn his
[02:13:17.340 --> 02:13:20.500]   oath to them in return.
[02:13:20.500 --> 02:13:24.380]   He felt a lump rise in his throat and blinked away tears.
[02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:27.940]   "Who are you?"
[02:13:27.940 --> 02:13:29.620]   Ildar asked him again.
[02:13:29.620 --> 02:13:34.940]   "No one," Corbin grunted, feeling a surge of bitter despair at that admission.
[02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:38.280]   "Certainly not the bright star everyone believed I was.
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:40.340]   I even came to believe it.
[02:13:40.340 --> 02:13:42.300]   I am the greatest of fools.
[02:13:42.300 --> 02:13:44.260]   That is who I am."
[02:13:44.260 --> 02:13:52.060]   "There is giant skill in this," Ildar observed, fingers running over the spiral of the arm
[02:13:52.060 --> 02:13:53.060]   ring.
[02:13:53.060 --> 02:13:57.940]   "At Graham's hold warriors stood about you.
[02:13:57.940 --> 02:14:04.820]   You commanded and others listened, and yesterday men came to save you."
[02:14:04.820 --> 02:14:09.540]   He moved closer, face almost touching Corbin's his small dark eyes staring.
[02:14:09.540 --> 02:14:12.780]   "I do not think you are no one.
[02:14:12.780 --> 02:14:16.220]   Start with your name, tell me that."
[02:14:16.220 --> 02:14:17.820]   Corbin clamped his lips together.
[02:14:17.820 --> 02:14:25.460]   "I could hurt you," Ildar said, matter-of-factly, hand opening and resting lightly upon Corbin's
[02:14:25.460 --> 02:14:27.740]   injured knee.
[02:14:27.740 --> 02:14:29.820]   Corbin sucked in a breath but said nothing.
[02:14:29.820 --> 02:14:34.660]   "Your name," Ildar said, flexing his fingers.
[02:14:34.660 --> 02:14:40.700]   "Something for something," Corbin said, as calmly as he could manage.
[02:14:40.700 --> 02:14:43.940]   Ildar stared at him a long, sweat-fueled moment.
[02:14:43.940 --> 02:14:49.220]   Then a smile cracked the slabs of the giant's face, his moustache twitching.
[02:14:49.220 --> 02:14:55.580]   "You have stones, little man, I'll give you that.
[02:14:55.580 --> 02:15:03.580]   Bargaining, with me, at a time like this—very well, something for something.
[02:15:03.580 --> 02:15:06.300]   Now what is your name?"
[02:15:06.300 --> 02:15:12.780]   "I am Corbin Ben-Thannan," Corbin said, lifting his chin high.
[02:15:12.780 --> 02:15:18.380]   "That is who I am, my father's son, no more, no less."
[02:15:18.380 --> 02:15:23.420]   At that moment he had never missed his dare more fiercely nor felt so proud of his memory.
[02:15:23.420 --> 02:15:29.140]   Ildar nodded thoughtfully, as if he were turning the name over in his mind.
[02:15:29.140 --> 02:15:33.900]   "All right, then," the giant finally said, "ask your question."
[02:15:33.900 --> 02:15:37.340]   "Where are you taking me?"
[02:15:37.340 --> 02:15:42.420]   Corbin asked, away from Drassil and his cursed forest.
[02:15:42.420 --> 02:15:47.340]   Ildar said, looking up at the shifting shadows and impenetrable trees around them.
[02:15:47.340 --> 02:15:48.500]   "Where?"
[02:15:48.500 --> 02:15:49.500]   Corbin repeated.
[02:15:49.500 --> 02:15:52.860]   "A place you know well enough.
[02:15:52.860 --> 02:15:59.860]   We are going to Graham's Hold."
[02:15:59.860 --> 02:16:01.900]   Chapter 9 FIDELAE
[02:16:01.900 --> 02:16:09.380]   FIDELAE walked the lines of their camp, nodding to guards, offering a word of encouragement
[02:16:09.380 --> 02:16:11.220]   here and there.
[02:16:11.220 --> 02:16:17.700]   Trees loomed towering colossi that transformed daylight into perpetual twilight.
[02:16:17.700 --> 02:16:22.980]   In this shadowed world the warband of Ripper camped, close to a thousand men, five hundred
[02:16:22.980 --> 02:16:25.240]   leagues from home.
[02:16:25.240 --> 02:16:29.420]   They must wonder why they are here so far from home, caught up in a war they hardly
[02:16:29.420 --> 02:16:33.820]   understand, a war that I barely understand.
[02:16:33.820 --> 02:16:40.100]   What she did know, though, was that her son was at the heart of it, Nefert.
[02:16:40.100 --> 02:16:43.180]   At the thought of him a tide of emotions swept through her.
[02:16:43.180 --> 02:16:47.340]   In shock, he is allied to the Kaddishim, my own son.
[02:16:47.340 --> 02:16:51.040]   How could he choose to be part of such a great evil?
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:56.620]   Anger that he had not chosen differently, that he had not stood for what was right.
[02:16:56.620 --> 02:17:01.500]   He is naive, has trusted flattering words and deceptive tongues, and walked the wrong
[02:17:01.500 --> 02:17:03.500]   path.
[02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:09.820]   Betrayal that he had chosen Caledus over her, a point made so clear during her trial.
[02:17:09.820 --> 02:17:13.860]   Regret that she had not seen the course he was treading earlier and done something to
[02:17:13.860 --> 02:17:17.420]   help him while there had still been time.
[02:17:17.420 --> 02:17:24.620]   Sadness, no, something far deeper than that, more akin to grief.
[02:17:24.620 --> 02:17:29.460]   It almost felt as if he had died that she had lost him forever.
[02:17:29.460 --> 02:17:31.340]   Not forever.
[02:17:31.340 --> 02:17:32.580]   There is still hope for him.
[02:17:32.580 --> 02:17:41.260]   There must be hatred for Caledus, the catalyst and center of her fury, a Kaddishim demon
[02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:48.260]   made flesh, his will set on corrupting Nefert and bending him to his purposes.
[02:17:48.260 --> 02:17:53.780]   Threaded between and amongst all those emotions was one more, love.
[02:17:53.780 --> 02:17:58.580]   A mother's love for her son, built upon the vulnerable child she had nursed at her breast,
[02:17:58.580 --> 02:18:01.300]   whom she had nurtured and protected.
[02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:06.100]   A fierce love that had always seen the best in him, that believed in his ability, his
[02:18:06.100 --> 02:18:09.780]   strength and intellect believed in him.
[02:18:09.780 --> 02:18:13.380]   A love that still fueled a hope that he would eventually see the wrong he had done, that
[02:18:13.380 --> 02:18:17.620]   he would turn back from the dark path he was being led down.
[02:18:17.620 --> 02:18:22.060]   At the perimeter of their camp, two guards with the eagle of tannabral upon their breastplate
[02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:24.420]   saluted her.
[02:18:24.420 --> 02:18:28.180]   Men always stood together in this forest, never alone.
[02:18:28.180 --> 02:18:32.500]   The creatures of form were better defended against that way.
[02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:35.460]   Fidele stood and stared out into the shadows of the forest.
[02:18:35.460 --> 02:18:41.340]   "We must leave," a voice said beside her, making her jump.
[02:18:41.340 --> 02:18:46.760]   Albin, the white-haired healer, had followed her, his footsteps little more than a whisper
[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:49.340]   upon the forest floor.
[02:18:49.340 --> 02:18:53.860]   A bandage was wrapped around the wound between his shoulder and chest that the traitorous
[02:18:53.860 --> 02:18:58.580]   Ektor had given in the dungeons beneath Brickhan.
[02:18:58.580 --> 02:19:04.980]   Quiet shy Ektor, rather to Krellus and Veridus, more accustomed to holding a scroll than a
[02:19:04.980 --> 02:19:05.980]   sword.
[02:19:05.980 --> 02:19:13.220]   And yet he had betrayed them and slain one of her most trusted companions, Peritus.
[02:19:13.220 --> 02:19:17.020]   It had been little more than a ten night ago, and her grief was still fresh, but Albin seemed
[02:19:17.020 --> 02:19:19.700]   to have recovered well.
[02:19:19.700 --> 02:19:26.460]   He is a remarkable man, and a mysterious one, a warrior and a healer, both, but so much
[02:19:26.460 --> 02:19:31.020]   more than that, friend to Mykal, part of a secret group that has been waiting for these
[02:19:31.020 --> 02:19:32.420]   days preparing.
[02:19:32.420 --> 02:19:35.660]   "We must leave," Albin repeated.
[02:19:35.660 --> 02:19:37.860]   "Time is against us."
[02:19:37.860 --> 02:19:43.860]   "No," she replied, an automatic response.
[02:19:43.860 --> 02:19:46.540]   She drew in a long breath composing herself.
[02:19:46.540 --> 02:19:51.500]   "This war band will not just march away from Krellus, they are men of Ripper."
[02:19:51.500 --> 02:19:56.300]   "They'll do what you order them to do," Albin said quietly.
[02:19:56.300 --> 02:19:57.780]   "You are their queen."
[02:19:57.780 --> 02:20:01.700]   "I don't want to be queen.
[02:20:01.700 --> 02:20:04.620]   So many years I've put duty first."
[02:20:04.620 --> 02:20:07.900]   She looked at Albin, saw him studying her face.
[02:20:07.900 --> 02:20:11.180]   "He knows why I do not wish to leave."
[02:20:11.180 --> 02:20:15.860]   "I'll not leave without Meqin."
[02:20:15.860 --> 02:20:22.340]   The warrior's face filled her mind, beaten and scarred, proud, fierce.
[02:20:22.340 --> 02:20:26.540]   She felt her spirit's lift at the thought of him, remembered sitting at his side in
[02:20:26.540 --> 02:20:30.900]   the tower at Ripper, when he had opened his eyes after lying on the brink of death for
[02:20:30.900 --> 02:20:33.180]   so long.
[02:20:33.180 --> 02:20:36.900]   He had told her that he had stood upon the bridge of swords, that one of the Ben Elim
[02:20:36.900 --> 02:20:38.540]   had given him a choice.
[02:20:38.540 --> 02:20:42.660]   "To cross over or go back?" he told her.
[02:20:42.660 --> 02:20:46.420]   "Why did you come back, then?" she had asked him.
[02:20:46.420 --> 02:20:48.460]   "Three reasons.
[02:20:48.460 --> 02:20:49.620]   Three people.
[02:20:49.620 --> 02:20:50.620]   Jail.
[02:20:50.620 --> 02:20:51.620]   Lycus.
[02:20:51.620 --> 02:20:52.620]   You."
[02:20:52.620 --> 02:20:56.420]   He had paused and looked up into her eyes.
[02:20:56.420 --> 02:20:59.060]   "Two for vengeance.
[02:20:59.060 --> 02:21:01.740]   One for love."
[02:21:01.740 --> 02:21:06.060]   Her lips twitched in a smile at the memory of it.
[02:21:06.060 --> 02:21:08.700]   Albin's eyes creased with worry and perhaps compassion.
[02:21:08.700 --> 02:21:13.580]   "You'll lose this war for one man?"
[02:21:13.580 --> 02:21:17.260]   So many answers flashed through her mind, most of them convincing in their own right,
[02:21:17.260 --> 02:21:19.620]   but she knew they were not the truth.
[02:21:19.620 --> 02:21:23.580]   "It will not come to that," she snapped.
[02:21:23.580 --> 02:21:24.580]   Albin frowned.
[02:21:24.580 --> 02:21:29.220]   "You cannot choose one man over a nation," he said.
[02:21:29.220 --> 02:21:32.680]   "More than that, the whole of the Banished Lands.
[02:21:32.680 --> 02:21:34.420]   We are in the God-War.
[02:21:34.420 --> 02:21:36.860]   We cannot just walk away from this.
[02:21:36.860 --> 02:21:41.560]   It will consume the Banished Lands, and when it is done, those who stand against us, Roth,
[02:21:41.560 --> 02:21:44.820]   will either be victorious or they will be dead.
[02:21:44.820 --> 02:21:46.620]   There is nothing in between.
[02:21:46.620 --> 02:21:48.620]   It is war.
[02:21:48.620 --> 02:21:49.620]   Sacrifices must be made."
[02:21:49.620 --> 02:21:57.020]   "I am familiar with sacrifice," she said coldly, "but I'll not be a pawn to an absent
[02:21:57.020 --> 02:21:58.020]   God.
[02:21:58.020 --> 02:22:01.780]   I'll fight for my freedom, for my people, and follow my conscience.
[02:22:01.780 --> 02:22:06.420]   Yes, I fear for McKean, and I long for his return, but more than that, this war-band
[02:22:06.420 --> 02:22:10.580]   is stronger with him and with Krellus.
[02:22:10.580 --> 02:22:15.980]   And Veridus, if they manage to find him, we must give them more time."
[02:22:15.980 --> 02:22:25.020]   "They may never return, my Lady," Albin said quietly, voicing her deepest fear.
[02:22:25.020 --> 02:22:27.680]   Doubt and worry gnawed at her.
[02:22:27.680 --> 02:22:32.660]   She remembered standing on the riverbank beyond Rickon's tower as the war-band escaped deeper
[02:22:32.660 --> 02:22:37.340]   into the forest, camouflaged amongst Nathea's warriors.
[02:22:37.340 --> 02:22:42.300]   McKean, Albin, and Krellus had stood with her, looking back at the tower, thinking of
[02:22:42.300 --> 02:22:48.980]   Veridus and what he had vowed to do, to slay Caledus, one of the Khadoshim.
[02:22:48.980 --> 02:22:52.800]   They had all seen the explosion of fire light up the tower window, and moments later seen
[02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:56.860]   the forms leak from it, hurtling into the river.
[02:22:56.860 --> 02:22:57.860]   It was Veridus.
[02:22:57.860 --> 02:23:00.860]   They were sure.
[02:23:00.860 --> 02:23:06.060]   Albin and Krellus had made to rush after him then and there, but Albin had stayed them
[02:23:06.060 --> 02:23:11.420]   a while, calling out names and gathering a score of men to go with them.
[02:23:11.420 --> 02:23:14.100]   McKean had crushed her in a tight embrace.
[02:23:14.100 --> 02:23:17.500]   "Stay," she had whispered in his ear.
[02:23:17.500 --> 02:23:23.260]   "Veridus is my friend," McKean had replied, "and he freed us."
[02:23:23.260 --> 02:23:29.460]   She'd held his gaze a long, heartfelt moment, and then he was gone, running into the night.
[02:23:29.460 --> 02:23:31.580]   Was that our last moment together?
[02:23:31.580 --> 02:23:38.560]   "My lady," one of the guards closed by a said, pointing into the darkness of Thorn Forest.
[02:23:38.560 --> 02:23:41.260]   Someone approaches.
[02:23:41.260 --> 02:23:45.460]   Fidele stared into the shadows, Albin tensed beside her, a fist clamped around the hilt
[02:23:45.460 --> 02:23:47.460]   of his sword.
[02:23:47.460 --> 02:23:52.860]   One of the guards had raised a horn to his lips, ready to sound the call to arms.
[02:23:52.860 --> 02:23:59.580]   Soldiers separated from the gloom, dark silhouettes, six, seven, then one more, looming behind
[02:23:59.580 --> 02:24:04.220]   the others, dwarfing them, a giant.
[02:24:04.220 --> 02:24:08.220]   Swords were scraping from scabbards, then Fidele recognised the first figure as it passed
[02:24:08.220 --> 02:24:11.140]   through a beam of daylight.
[02:24:11.140 --> 02:24:16.420]   Albin reached a hand out to the guard with a horn to his lips and pulled the horn away,
[02:24:16.420 --> 02:24:20.220]   one of the scouts whom Albin sent to watch the road.
[02:24:20.220 --> 02:24:24.340]   He was leading a group through the forest towards their camp.
[02:24:24.340 --> 02:24:30.660]   She felt her pulse quicken as her eyes scanned the shapes behind him, and then she was running,
[02:24:30.660 --> 02:24:35.340]   pushing past the guards, ferns, and branches whipping at her face.
[02:24:35.340 --> 02:24:39.580]   Another figure was moving ahead of the scout, running towards her, a loping stride, all
[02:24:39.580 --> 02:24:45.340]   controlled strength and grace, "McKean."
[02:24:45.340 --> 02:24:50.820]   He opened his stride and ran ahead of the others, meeting Fidele between two great oaks.
[02:24:50.820 --> 02:24:55.380]   They fell into each other, making his arms gripping her around the waist and crushing
[02:24:55.380 --> 02:24:57.340]   her against him.
[02:24:57.340 --> 02:25:04.140]   Her lips found his, and the next few moments were lost to the scent and taste of him.
[02:25:04.140 --> 02:25:07.980]   Eventually she heard the others approaching and stepped back, hands still holding his,
[02:25:07.980 --> 02:25:09.700]   and looked at him.
[02:25:09.700 --> 02:25:13.300]   He was sweat-stained, hair pressed dark against his head.
[02:25:13.300 --> 02:25:19.500]   And he was smiling at her, softening the hard lines and scars upon his face.
[02:25:19.500 --> 02:25:23.940]   He reached out and brushed a strand of hair from her cheek.
[02:25:23.940 --> 02:25:30.700]   "Now, that's a greeting worth fighting demons from the other world for," he said, "even
[02:25:30.700 --> 02:25:34.820]   if it is most unqueenly behaviour."
[02:25:34.820 --> 02:25:37.700]   A glance acknowledged the eyes gathering upon them.
[02:25:37.700 --> 02:25:45.540]   "I am more than just a queen," Fidele said with a shrug, "and besides, in these times
[02:25:45.540 --> 02:25:49.500]   death feels never more than a few steps behind us.
[02:25:49.500 --> 02:25:55.220]   While I still draw breath, I'll live my life as I choose."
[02:25:55.220 --> 02:26:00.140]   Her eyes drifted to his bare arm, a jagged wound hastily stitched.
[02:26:00.140 --> 02:26:03.300]   It looked more like an animal bite than the product of a weapon.
[02:26:03.300 --> 02:26:06.780]   The edges were torn and bloodied.
[02:26:06.780 --> 02:26:10.740]   He saw her gaze upon the injury and shrugged wryly.
[02:26:10.740 --> 02:26:14.260]   "Can you never come back to me without a fresh wound?"
[02:26:14.260 --> 02:26:19.820]   "It's a bad habit, I must confess," he smiled at her.
[02:26:19.820 --> 02:26:24.560]   The others gathered about them now, and Fidele saw Krellus standing with Veridus, the bulk
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:27.460]   of Elsie on the giant behind them.
[02:26:27.460 --> 02:26:31.540]   They were both blood-stained and sweating, exhausted, but both of them were grinning
[02:26:31.540 --> 02:26:35.900]   at Albin as the old warrior hugged them both.
[02:26:35.900 --> 02:26:39.820]   There was a crashing behind her, and they all turned to see rain of a giant's ass and her
[02:26:39.820 --> 02:26:43.540]   bear and plowing through the undergrowth towards them.
[02:26:43.540 --> 02:26:47.660]   Alcion pushed past Krellus and Veridus, sending them flying, and met his family with an inhuman
[02:26:47.660 --> 02:26:52.940]   howl, their arms wrapping around one another, holding, squeezing as if they were becoming
[02:26:52.940 --> 02:26:53.940]   one.
[02:26:53.940 --> 02:26:59.860]   Slowly, they sank to their knees, still entwined, a shuddering sound pulsating from them.
[02:26:59.860 --> 02:27:02.020]   Alcion sobbed.
[02:27:02.020 --> 02:27:07.020]   He held their faces, smothered them both with kisses, wife and son, and their tears and
[02:27:07.020 --> 02:27:10.220]   smiles mingled with his.
[02:27:10.220 --> 02:27:14.580]   In such dark times as these it was heart-warming to see such love.
[02:27:14.580 --> 02:27:18.500]   She gripped Makiin's hand more tightly in her own.
[02:27:18.500 --> 02:27:20.940]   If only such happiness could last.
[02:27:20.940 --> 02:27:23.740]   "So, what now?"
[02:27:23.740 --> 02:27:25.540]   Krellus asked them.
[02:27:25.540 --> 02:27:29.220]   The small gathering were sitting around the burned-out remains of a fire pit in the center
[02:27:29.220 --> 02:27:30.220]   of their camp.
[02:27:30.220 --> 02:27:33.700]   "We must go to Drassil," Alden said.
[02:27:33.700 --> 02:27:35.380]   "Must we?"
[02:27:35.380 --> 02:27:37.740]   Krellus asked, looking around at them all.
[02:27:37.740 --> 02:27:44.540]   "I'm not one to walk away from a fight, but I've just lost nineteen men to-"
[02:27:44.540 --> 02:27:46.100]   His voice trailed off.
[02:27:46.100 --> 02:27:49.500]   "To demons of the other world," Veridus said.
[02:27:49.500 --> 02:27:52.220]   "To the Caddishim."
[02:27:52.220 --> 02:27:54.780]   Still can't quite believe it.
[02:27:54.780 --> 02:27:57.420]   Krellus muttered, wiping a hand across his eyes.
[02:27:57.420 --> 02:28:02.820]   "I'm not one for fairy tales," he said, "but I know what I saw.
[02:28:02.820 --> 02:28:09.280]   My blade in an enemy's heart and the bloody creature just smiled at me."
[02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:13.300]   I had to take his head to stop him trying to rip my throat out.
[02:28:13.300 --> 02:28:18.740]   I saw winged things of mist and shadow forming above the headless corpses.
[02:28:18.740 --> 02:28:19.740]   He shook his head.
[02:28:19.740 --> 02:28:24.740]   "If we go to Drassil, it sounds as if we'll fess an army of these things.
[02:28:24.740 --> 02:28:32.500]   My men are warriors, bred for battle, brave and true-hearted, but they are only men of
[02:28:32.500 --> 02:28:34.660]   flesh and blood.
[02:28:34.660 --> 02:28:38.340]   So I must ask this question."
[02:28:38.340 --> 02:28:39.700]   His gaze returned to Alden.
[02:28:39.700 --> 02:28:43.380]   "Is this our fight?"
[02:28:43.380 --> 02:28:46.060]   Slowly, Alden nodded.
[02:28:46.060 --> 02:28:48.340]   "It is," he said.
[02:28:48.340 --> 02:28:51.380]   "This is the God-War, Krellus.
[02:28:51.380 --> 02:28:55.700]   Michael and the Bright Star are there, so Drassil must be where it will be decided."
[02:28:55.700 --> 02:29:04.020]   "The battle is most likely already over," Krellus said, "n'affair and his allies have
[02:29:04.020 --> 02:29:06.780]   at least a ten nights' march on us."
[02:29:06.780 --> 02:29:10.820]   "If we do not go, who else will?"
[02:29:10.820 --> 02:29:11.820]   Alden said.
[02:29:11.820 --> 02:29:13.780]   "It is our duty to go."
[02:29:13.780 --> 02:29:20.660]   "My duty is to my men," Krellus said, waving a hand at the warband about them and to the
[02:29:20.660 --> 02:29:21.660]   people of Tenebral.
[02:29:21.660 --> 02:29:24.540]   "We are less than a thousand swords.
[02:29:24.540 --> 02:29:25.540]   We cannot win.
[02:29:25.540 --> 02:29:30.880]   A strategic man would withdraw, live to fight another day when the odds are more in our
[02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:31.880]   favour."
[02:29:31.880 --> 02:29:38.020]   "There will not be another day if we do not fight now," Alden said.
[02:29:38.020 --> 02:29:42.060]   "Kallidus and N'affair will destroy our allies one by one.
[02:29:42.060 --> 02:29:47.340]   We must stand with those who oppose them now before it is too late."
[02:29:47.340 --> 02:29:52.140]   "And what if there's none of these allies left alive at Drassil by the time we get there?"
[02:29:52.140 --> 02:29:57.840]   "We won't know unless we go there," Albin replied.
[02:29:57.840 --> 02:30:02.220]   A silence lengthened, all looking between Krellus and Albin.
[02:30:02.220 --> 02:30:08.300]   "Well, maybe you're right," Krellus eventually said, nodding thoughtfully.
[02:30:08.300 --> 02:30:13.100]   "I've always come to you when it's wisdom I've been looking for.
[02:30:13.100 --> 02:30:16.100]   But what if you're wrong?"
[02:30:16.100 --> 02:30:22.340]   Marching deep into the heart of Thorne, into unknown ground against a foe that outnumbers
[02:30:22.340 --> 02:30:23.420]   us greatly.
[02:30:23.420 --> 02:30:25.980]   "That's not wisdom.
[02:30:25.980 --> 02:30:29.020]   Not when we could retreat and choose our own ground.
[02:30:29.020 --> 02:30:33.300]   But still, this is a fight we must all agree to.
[02:30:33.300 --> 02:30:41.540]   I say to all of you, ask you all, as my brothers-in-arms, are you for this fight here?
[02:30:41.540 --> 02:30:45.860]   Now, are you for Drassil or are you for home?"
[02:30:45.860 --> 02:30:48.740]   "Home," thought Fidele.
[02:30:48.740 --> 02:30:55.020]   "Part of me longs to find a place of peace with Makin where this war cannot touch us.
[02:30:55.020 --> 02:30:58.820]   But is there a place far enough from this war to escape it?
[02:30:58.820 --> 02:31:04.420]   And even if there were, I would not abandon the people of Tenebrau to death and torment.
[02:31:04.420 --> 02:31:06.660]   And then there is an affair.
[02:31:06.660 --> 02:31:08.780]   Whatever he has done, he is still my son.
[02:31:08.780 --> 02:31:10.860]   I cannot just leave him."
[02:31:10.860 --> 02:31:19.520]   "Well," Krellis said, dragging Fidele from her thoughts, "we are friends here, equals.
[02:31:19.520 --> 02:31:22.420]   We have not been ordered by our lord or king.
[02:31:22.420 --> 02:31:24.980]   We are free to choose.
[02:31:24.980 --> 02:31:26.980]   Let us put it to the vote.
[02:31:26.980 --> 02:31:31.140]   As for me, I say we leave this forest behind us.
[02:31:31.140 --> 02:31:34.220]   Back to Tenebrau to raise more swords and choose our battleground."
[02:31:34.220 --> 02:31:39.100]   "I am for Drassil," Albin said.
[02:31:39.100 --> 02:31:43.900]   And Fidele looked around the firepit, saw all lost in their own deliberations.
[02:31:43.900 --> 02:31:50.260]   "I would go to Drassil," she thought, "to save my son and for vengeance upon Lycus.
[02:31:50.260 --> 02:31:51.760]   But Krellis speaks wisdom."
[02:31:51.760 --> 02:31:55.460]   "What of you, little brother?"
[02:31:55.460 --> 02:31:56.460]   Krellis asked.
[02:31:56.460 --> 02:32:01.500]   "Are you for the great tree or for home on the bay?"
[02:32:01.500 --> 02:32:05.780]   Veridys finally raised his head and regarded them all with his dark, serious eyes.
[02:32:05.780 --> 02:32:13.220]   "I have been a fool, been deceived, and committed dark deeds in the name of good."
[02:32:13.220 --> 02:32:17.840]   His face twisted with a bit of grimace as he looked at his open palms.
[02:32:17.840 --> 02:32:21.100]   Much blood those hands have spilt, for Calidus.
[02:32:21.100 --> 02:32:27.340]   "I would do what I can to put that right," Veridys continued, "but how?"
[02:32:27.340 --> 02:32:28.340]   he mused.
[02:32:28.340 --> 02:32:32.420]   "My heart says Drassil, my head says home.
[02:32:32.420 --> 02:32:37.780]   This is right, we do not know what awaits us at Drassil, though I do know this.
[02:32:37.780 --> 02:32:43.940]   Calidus has charged Jael of Isildir, Gundul of Carnotan, and Lothar of Helveth to build
[02:32:43.940 --> 02:32:49.940]   roads to Drassil, and with them they bring the full might of their realms.
[02:32:49.940 --> 02:32:53.540]   If we managed to make the long journey through Faun, we would face impossible odds at the
[02:32:53.540 --> 02:32:54.540]   end of it."
[02:32:54.540 --> 02:32:59.940]   "Not if my girl and the bright star still stand," Albin said.
[02:32:59.940 --> 02:33:06.620]   "And if they have fallen," Credis said, "you are advising us to do the opposite of all
[02:33:06.620 --> 02:33:08.660]   you have taught.
[02:33:08.660 --> 02:33:14.580]   Know your enemy, choose your ground, that's what you've always told me."
[02:33:14.580 --> 02:33:15.580]   Credis shook his head.
[02:33:15.580 --> 02:33:17.740]   "I know," Albin admitted.
[02:33:17.740 --> 02:33:20.140]   "What of you?"
[02:33:20.140 --> 02:33:24.780]   Credis asked, shifting his gaze to Alcion and the Giants.
[02:33:24.780 --> 02:33:28.960]   Reina was cutting Alcion's hair with her knife, leaving the top long and thick, the sides
[02:33:28.960 --> 02:33:30.180]   shaved to the skin.
[02:33:30.180 --> 02:33:33.420]   "What is she doing to him?
[02:33:33.420 --> 02:33:35.660]   He looks more fearsome than ever before."
[02:33:35.660 --> 02:33:40.420]   "We will travel with you, whichever way you go."
[02:33:40.420 --> 02:33:44.420]   "If you will have us," Alcion said.
[02:33:44.420 --> 02:33:47.820]   "And why would you wish to join us?"
[02:33:47.820 --> 02:33:49.420]   Credis asked, eyes narrowing.
[02:33:49.420 --> 02:33:53.780]   "Why not just leave now and go back to your clan?"
[02:33:53.780 --> 02:33:58.740]   "Two reasons," Alcion said, his voice like gravel.
[02:33:58.740 --> 02:34:03.420]   "A blood debt," he glanced at Credis, "and a blood feud."
[02:34:03.420 --> 02:34:09.860]   "As you said the last," his fists clenched, knuckles popping.
[02:34:09.860 --> 02:34:15.780]   "Caledis made me a slave, kept my family prisoner.
[02:34:15.780 --> 02:34:18.060]   I would even that score.
[02:34:18.060 --> 02:34:22.580]   Fight him now, fight him later."
[02:34:22.580 --> 02:34:23.580]   Alcion shrugged.
[02:34:23.580 --> 02:34:28.100]   "As long as I fight him, I care not.
[02:34:28.100 --> 02:34:31.860]   If you don't mind me asking," Credis added to Alcion.
[02:34:31.860 --> 02:34:35.620]   "Buy the new haircut."
[02:34:35.620 --> 02:34:39.180]   Alcion rubbed the side of his head, stubble, rasping on his palm, the hair on the top of
[02:34:39.180 --> 02:34:41.020]   his head a thick wedge.
[02:34:41.020 --> 02:34:45.380]   "This is my clan's tradition.
[02:34:45.380 --> 02:34:51.940]   When Caledis caught me and bent me to his will, I was Kurgan no longer.
[02:34:51.940 --> 02:34:55.980]   I did not deserve the mark of my clan.
[02:34:55.980 --> 02:34:59.820]   But now I am Kurgan again."
[02:34:59.820 --> 02:35:01.460]   He smiled viciously.
[02:35:01.460 --> 02:35:07.900]   "Neither course is clear," Fidele said, "though wisdom suggests we retreat.
[02:35:07.900 --> 02:35:10.940]   Are there any other options?"
[02:35:10.940 --> 02:35:15.580]   "We could fight now," Makiin said.
[02:35:15.580 --> 02:35:17.660]   All eyes turned to him.
[02:35:17.660 --> 02:35:21.860]   The grizzled warrior looked at his hands, turning them over.
[02:35:21.860 --> 02:35:25.340]   Fidele beside him saw the calluses and scars.
[02:35:25.340 --> 02:35:30.220]   In the pit, I have faced one foe, and I have faced many foes.
[02:35:30.220 --> 02:35:34.420]   It is always easier against one.
[02:35:34.420 --> 02:35:37.860]   I saw him fight four men and slay them all.
[02:35:37.860 --> 02:35:43.380]   Against many, I strike fast, before they have a chance to join against me, and I strike
[02:35:43.380 --> 02:35:46.940]   hard to kill with one blow.
[02:35:46.940 --> 02:35:51.020]   "Aye, but this is no pits.
[02:35:51.020 --> 02:35:58.380]   This is fawn forest, and our enemies are not lining up before us," Krellis growled.
[02:35:58.380 --> 02:36:03.060]   "They will be, if we allow them to.
[02:36:03.060 --> 02:36:05.300]   But one of them is close to us.
[02:36:05.300 --> 02:36:10.580]   Cut off from the others, Gundl and the warband of Carnotan are out there, close, building
[02:36:10.580 --> 02:36:15.660]   a road, distracted, spread out with their backs to us.
[02:36:15.660 --> 02:36:20.700]   We'll likely fight him one day, though next time we see him we'll probably be with half
[02:36:20.700 --> 02:36:24.660]   the realms of the Banished Lands at his back.
[02:36:24.660 --> 02:36:31.020]   Whether we go to Drassil or walk away, I say we have an opportunity here to even the odds
[02:36:31.020 --> 02:36:32.020]   a little.
[02:36:32.020 --> 02:36:35.340]   An opportunity would be fools to miss.
[02:36:35.340 --> 02:36:45.740]   And besides," he added, "there's nothing like a good fight to clear the mind."
[02:36:45.740 --> 02:36:51.060]   Up to ten.
[02:36:51.060 --> 02:36:52.060]   Jail
[02:36:52.060 --> 02:36:55.820]   Jail stumbled and almost fell, swearing under his breath as he reached out to grab a thick
[02:36:55.820 --> 02:36:56.820]   branch.
[02:36:56.820 --> 02:37:00.260]   "I hate this forest."
[02:37:00.260 --> 02:37:05.700]   He steadied himself, pausing to wipe sweat from his brow and catch a few breaths.
[02:37:05.700 --> 02:37:10.100]   His huntsman dag was somewhere up ahead, setting a gruelling pate as they marched through fawn
[02:37:10.100 --> 02:37:11.100]   forest.
[02:37:11.100 --> 02:37:15.660]   "How many nights have we lived in this twilight nightmare?
[02:37:15.660 --> 02:37:16.660]   Twenty?
[02:37:16.660 --> 02:37:17.660]   Thirty?
[02:37:17.660 --> 02:37:18.660]   A hundred?
[02:37:18.660 --> 02:37:20.660]   Will it ever end?"
[02:37:20.660 --> 02:37:27.180]   A line of warriors was strung before and behind him, a few hundred men, the only survivors
[02:37:27.180 --> 02:37:32.340]   of his warband that had marched so proudly to the gates of Drassil.
[02:37:32.340 --> 02:37:38.140]   Thousands strong, the might of Isilthir now broken, slain or scattered, and a third of
[02:37:38.140 --> 02:37:43.540]   those who fled with me have fallen since then to the forest and to its inhabitants.
[02:37:43.540 --> 02:37:47.980]   He shuddered at the memory of finding guards gray and lifeless, their blood drained like
[02:37:47.980 --> 02:37:52.860]   juice from a ripe fruit, nothing much more left of them than skin and bone.
[02:37:52.860 --> 02:37:56.660]   How did it come to this?
[02:37:56.660 --> 02:38:03.140]   Victory was so close, Drassil almost mine, how did that boy defeat Sumur?
[02:38:03.140 --> 02:38:08.620]   He ground his teeth at the memory of Corbin taking the Caddashim's head in single combat.
[02:38:08.620 --> 02:38:13.220]   It had been a blow he could not deny, and it had done little for the morale of Jael's
[02:38:13.220 --> 02:38:15.380]   warband.
[02:38:15.380 --> 02:38:21.380]   So Jael had ordered his finest warriors, his personal guard, to swarm Corbin and slay him.
[02:38:21.380 --> 02:38:26.340]   Sure, victory had seemed mere heartbeats away, but then the gates of Drassil had opened,
[02:38:26.340 --> 02:38:31.100]   that devil, wolfen and the stallion galloping out ahead of a host of giants and sword-waving
[02:38:31.100 --> 02:38:32.100]   lunatics.
[02:38:32.100 --> 02:38:36.820]   It had all gone downhill from there.
[02:38:36.820 --> 02:38:40.220]   That had been when Jael had made the decision to retreat.
[02:38:40.220 --> 02:38:42.380]   Retreat, not flee.
[02:38:42.380 --> 02:38:45.700]   A strategic withdrawal.
[02:38:45.700 --> 02:38:49.100]   Better to retreat and live to fight another day.
[02:38:49.100 --> 02:38:51.220]   And that is what I shall do here.
[02:38:51.220 --> 02:38:56.420]   Retreat to Izeltir, raise a fresh warband, fight to hold on to what I have achieved.
[02:38:56.420 --> 02:39:00.540]   "My lord," a voice said behind him.
[02:39:00.540 --> 02:39:04.280]   A sweat-soaked warrior was giving him a concerned frown.
[02:39:04.280 --> 02:39:05.860]   "What?"
[02:39:05.860 --> 02:39:07.300]   Jael snapped, irritably.
[02:39:07.300 --> 02:39:13.620]   "The line, my king," the warrior said, jerking his head forwards.
[02:39:13.620 --> 02:39:17.940]   Jael realized the warriors he'd been following were still moving, disappearing into the foliage
[02:39:17.940 --> 02:39:20.020]   and shadows.
[02:39:20.020 --> 02:39:23.940]   Fear jolted him into movement, the thought of being stranded in the forest without dagg
[02:39:23.940 --> 02:39:28.580]   to guide him was a horror he had no wish to endure.
[02:39:28.580 --> 02:39:33.260]   He hastened on, limbs heavy and leaden, catching up with the men ahead then he was settling
[02:39:33.260 --> 02:39:39.300]   back into the monotonous march, his eyes fixed on the heels of the man in front of him.
[02:39:39.300 --> 02:39:43.180]   Whispering ahead caused Jael to look up from the ground.
[02:39:43.180 --> 02:39:47.380]   Dagg was moving back down the line, patting a shoulder here, pausing to say a few words
[02:39:47.380 --> 02:39:49.380]   there.
[02:39:49.380 --> 02:39:52.580]   Never thought of him as leader material.
[02:39:52.580 --> 02:39:55.660]   For some reason the thought irritated Jael.
[02:39:55.660 --> 02:39:59.940]   He seemed like a loner, and those scars on his face don't make him more pleasant to be
[02:39:59.940 --> 02:40:01.940]   around.
[02:40:01.940 --> 02:40:04.060]   The huntsman eventually reached Jael.
[02:40:04.060 --> 02:40:09.980]   "You have news," Jael asked, ashamed of the desperation and hope that he tried to keep
[02:40:09.980 --> 02:40:11.980]   from his voice.
[02:40:11.980 --> 02:40:17.600]   "Aye," Dagg said, "there's men up ahead."
[02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:21.540]   Jael peered through dense undergrowth, for a moment struggling to understand what he
[02:40:21.540 --> 02:40:26.940]   was seeing. Only a dozen or so paces away, the undergrowth ended.
[02:40:26.940 --> 02:40:32.420]   A man made clearing dotted with cut tree stumps led towards an embankment.
[02:40:32.420 --> 02:40:36.940]   Men, hundreds of them, were swarming over the embankment which stretched as far as he
[02:40:36.940 --> 02:40:39.220]   could see in both directions.
[02:40:39.220 --> 02:40:44.420]   They were working, many wielding long-handled axes and hammers were rising and falling,
[02:40:44.420 --> 02:40:47.420]   the rhythmic thud of their blows drumming through the forest.
[02:40:47.420 --> 02:40:50.800]   They're building a road.
[02:40:50.800 --> 02:40:55.540]   It must be Lothar, or Gundl, still building to reach Drassil and win the race that I had
[02:40:55.540 --> 02:40:57.700]   already won.
[02:40:57.700 --> 02:41:02.420]   Just looking at the industriousness of what could only be his allies, even if they were
[02:41:02.420 --> 02:41:07.220]   also rivals in Jael's mind, he began to feel something of his old confidence returning.
[02:41:07.220 --> 02:41:11.980]   "I am safe. Safe from the forest. Safe from pursuit."
[02:41:11.980 --> 02:41:19.540]   "With me," he said to Dagg, as he pushed his way through the undergrowth.
[02:41:19.540 --> 02:41:24.260]   He paused a moment, stood straighter and adjusted his tattered cloak, allowing his men to gather
[02:41:24.260 --> 02:41:29.000]   behind him, then marched across the clearing towards the embankment.
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:33.460]   The alarm was sounded when he was spotted and warriors rapidly appeared clad in mail
[02:41:33.460 --> 02:41:37.380]   in brandishing swords and spears.
[02:41:37.380 --> 02:41:43.300]   Quirasses and banners bore the emblem of a burning torch upon a pale field.
[02:41:43.300 --> 02:41:46.820]   Gundl's warband, then. Excellent.
[02:41:46.820 --> 02:41:51.960]   He is far weaker than Lothar, and much easier to manipulate.
[02:41:51.960 --> 02:41:55.300]   Jael strode to a warrior standing amidst what was rapidly becoming a bristling hedge of
[02:41:55.300 --> 02:42:00.340]   sharp iron, already imagining that they were his warriors, his warband.
[02:42:00.340 --> 02:42:06.260]   "Take me to your king," Jael demanded imperiously.
[02:42:06.260 --> 02:42:11.020]   Jael paused for a moment on the road down which warriors of Carnotan were leading him.
[02:42:11.020 --> 02:42:14.760]   He'd walked a good half-league away from the forefront of this new road, built upon a fresh
[02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:19.180]   piled embankment with the forest stripped back to either side.
[02:42:19.180 --> 02:42:23.060]   Wayans were moving up and down the road, warriors lining it.
[02:42:23.060 --> 02:42:27.180]   Gundl's camp appeared, a sprawling mass to the south of the new road, at its centre,
[02:42:27.180 --> 02:42:29.380]   a huge tent upon a low hill.
[02:42:29.380 --> 02:42:32.980]   "How many?" he whispered to Dag.
[02:42:32.980 --> 02:42:35.420]   He strode a step behind him.
[02:42:35.420 --> 02:42:39.380]   The rest of his tattered warband had been left at the side of the road.
[02:42:39.380 --> 02:42:44.860]   "Three, four thousand swords," the huntsman said with a shrug, hard to tell with all the
[02:42:44.860 --> 02:42:47.740]   other hangers on.
[02:42:47.740 --> 02:42:52.500]   They weaved through the camp, a host of sounds and smells assailing Jael as he was guided
[02:42:52.500 --> 02:42:58.740]   through a maze of tents and cookfires, cattle load from paddocks, the stink of human habitation
[02:42:58.740 --> 02:43:01.300]   wafting towards him.
[02:43:01.300 --> 02:43:05.860]   After being a refugee in this otherworldly and oppressive forest for so long, he felt
[02:43:05.860 --> 02:43:08.880]   almost overwhelmed by it.
[02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:14.460]   The tent, Jael had spied from the road, rose up before him, larger than it had at first
[02:43:14.460 --> 02:43:15.460]   appeared.
[02:43:15.460 --> 02:43:21.340]   His escort of a few score warriors led him purposefully towards it.
[02:43:21.340 --> 02:43:22.340]   Gundl.
[02:43:22.340 --> 02:43:27.900]   A circle of pale-skinned and black-eyed warriors stood guard about the tent, clothed in dark
[02:43:27.900 --> 02:43:32.660]   mail and leather, curved swords arching over their shoulders.
[02:43:32.660 --> 02:43:35.100]   Nathair's Jihar.
[02:43:35.100 --> 02:43:39.740]   A score of them had marched with his own warband with Sumur as their captain.
[02:43:39.740 --> 02:43:44.500]   He remembered Sumur's skill in battle, the fury of the others as they had charged into
[02:43:44.500 --> 02:43:50.580]   battle, and the winged things that poured from them like poison when they fell.
[02:43:50.580 --> 02:43:52.060]   His skin crawled.
[02:43:52.060 --> 02:43:58.260]   "Whatever they are, they are not men, but whatever they are, they still died, still
[02:43:58.260 --> 02:44:03.220]   failed me, so much for Nathair's great warriors."
[02:44:03.220 --> 02:44:08.200]   He felt an irrational anger about that, even as he felt fear and revulsion crawling across
[02:44:08.200 --> 02:44:09.820]   his skin.
[02:44:09.820 --> 02:44:12.140]   He regarded the Jihar before him suspiciously.
[02:44:12.140 --> 02:44:14.260]   "What are you?"
[02:44:14.260 --> 02:44:18.420]   "Respect them, don't fear them," he reminded himself.
[02:44:18.420 --> 02:44:24.500]   "They die the same as the rest of us," Sumur fell to Corbin, and the rest no doubt during
[02:44:24.500 --> 02:44:26.900]   the battle before the gates of Drassil.
[02:44:26.900 --> 02:44:31.240]   A pair of warriors parted before Jael.
[02:44:31.240 --> 02:44:36.440]   One opened the tent flap and Jael entered, Dag still a step behind.
[02:44:36.440 --> 02:44:40.700]   The tent was luxuriously furnished, thick furs carpeting the ground and gold-trimmed
[02:44:40.700 --> 02:44:43.620]   tapestries draping the walls.
[02:44:43.620 --> 02:44:48.940]   Perfumed candles burned, their scent thick and heavy in the air.
[02:44:48.940 --> 02:44:53.940]   Gundl was sitting on a wide-backed chair, one leg draped across the chair's arm, women
[02:44:53.940 --> 02:44:59.300]   clad in diaphanous silk, feeding him from various platters.
[02:44:59.300 --> 02:45:03.680]   The handful of young men lounged about him, their hair and beard slick and shining with
[02:45:03.680 --> 02:45:04.680]   oil.
[02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:07.980]   All of them were immaculately dressed in velvets and soft skins.
[02:45:07.980 --> 02:45:12.500]   "Look at them," fawning sycophants gathered about the pot of gold.
[02:45:12.500 --> 02:45:17.380]   "Not a single one of them looks like they've held a blade in battle."
[02:45:17.380 --> 02:45:19.260]   Jael suppressed a sneer.
[02:45:19.260 --> 02:45:25.140]   "Well met, Gundl," he said, as he strode forwards.
[02:45:25.140 --> 02:45:30.420]   Gundl studied him, a blank expression replaced slowly with recognition.
[02:45:30.420 --> 02:45:33.380]   He shifted in his chair but did not rise.
[02:45:33.380 --> 02:45:41.340]   "Well, if it isn't Jael of Izeltir," Gundl said, a flaccid smile spreading across his
[02:45:41.340 --> 02:45:42.340]   face.
[02:45:42.340 --> 02:45:48.100]   "King of Izeltir," Jael silently corrected as he returned a forced smile.
[02:45:48.100 --> 02:45:54.740]   "I did not recognize you," Gundl said, taking a long moment to look Jael up and down.
[02:45:54.740 --> 02:45:58.260]   Jael was abruptly aware of his appearance.
[02:45:58.260 --> 02:46:02.620]   When he rode to the gates of Drassil, he had been dressed in his finest war gear, a coat
[02:46:02.620 --> 02:46:10.940]   of gleaming chainmail, sable cloak trimmed with fur, britches and boots of doe skin.
[02:46:10.940 --> 02:46:16.500]   Now his cloak was mud-crusted and in tatters, his chainmail smeared and rusting his face
[02:46:16.500 --> 02:46:19.460]   and arms grimy and scratched beyond counting.
[02:46:19.460 --> 02:46:24.660]   "What a wonderful surprise," Gundl said with a barely disguised smirk.
[02:46:24.660 --> 02:46:30.260]   "I had heard that you were lost, presumed dead, after your defeat by the rabble at Drassil.
[02:46:30.260 --> 02:46:31.900]   I rejoice that you live."
[02:46:31.900 --> 02:46:40.780]   "Then why do you look so disappointed, already planning the annexation of my realm, I guess?"
[02:46:40.780 --> 02:46:44.500]   Nothing made Jael angrier than thought of someone else stealing the realm he had so recently
[02:46:44.500 --> 02:46:47.380]   stolen for himself.
[02:46:47.380 --> 02:46:50.180]   He suppressed the urge to wrap his fingers around Gundl's throat.
[02:46:50.180 --> 02:46:54.660]   "If he thinks he can take Isletir from me, I will make him ink to his own intestines."
[02:46:54.660 --> 02:47:03.220]   "A sentiment I share I can assure you," Jael said, strapping his smile upon his face.
[02:47:03.220 --> 02:47:07.060]   "The enemy at Drassil used fel magic against us.
[02:47:07.060 --> 02:47:11.980]   Alas, brave hearts and strong arms were not enough against the dark powers of Azeroth's
[02:47:11.980 --> 02:47:12.980]   black sun."
[02:47:12.980 --> 02:47:19.860]   "Really?" Gundl said, a more genuine smile twitching his lips.
[02:47:19.860 --> 02:47:22.060]   He sat straighter in his chair.
[02:47:22.060 --> 02:47:25.220]   "Nathair had little trouble against their fel magic."
[02:47:25.220 --> 02:47:29.220]   "What do you mean?" Jael asked.
[02:47:29.220 --> 02:47:32.780]   "King Nathair took Drassil over a ten night ago.
[02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:35.300]   The enemy are broken and scattered."
[02:47:35.300 --> 02:47:36.300]   "What?"
[02:47:36.300 --> 02:47:37.900]   "The war is over."
[02:47:37.900 --> 02:47:42.660]   "Well, from what I hear, there is some resistance still, but little more than the death throes
[02:47:42.660 --> 02:47:47.100]   of a foe that has not realized it's already lost."
[02:47:47.100 --> 02:47:50.420]   The war over, and my own war band defeated.
[02:47:50.420 --> 02:47:55.380]   I had hoped for more time to return to Isletir and raise a new war band, fresh battles, and
[02:47:55.380 --> 02:47:58.220]   win some glory before the war was ended.
[02:47:58.220 --> 02:47:59.220]   "But now."
[02:47:59.220 --> 02:48:04.860]   "That is wonderful news," Jael said, speaking through a fixed grin.
[02:48:04.860 --> 02:48:08.100]   "I can see that your old building is going well.
[02:48:08.100 --> 02:48:09.500]   If I could ask one favor."
[02:48:09.500 --> 02:48:12.540]   "What do you want?"
[02:48:12.540 --> 02:48:15.940]   Gundl asked, looking suddenly bored with the conversation.
[02:48:15.940 --> 02:48:21.260]   "He thinks to be broken, a defeated rival of no consequence."
[02:48:21.260 --> 02:48:22.940]   Jael stopped his teeth from grinding.
[02:48:22.940 --> 02:48:27.420]   "Horses for myself and my men, and escort back to Isletir."
[02:48:27.420 --> 02:48:30.420]   "Your men?"
[02:48:30.420 --> 02:48:36.780]   Gundl sniffed, looking disdainfully at Dag, who stood silently behind Jael.
[02:48:36.780 --> 02:48:39.980]   One of the young men gathered about Gundl sniggered.
[02:48:39.980 --> 02:48:40.980]   "Calm?
[02:48:40.980 --> 02:48:42.520]   Get what you need.
[02:48:42.520 --> 02:48:45.060]   Just remember the sycophant's face."
[02:48:45.060 --> 02:48:50.660]   "Yes, King Gundl," Jael said, in his most comradely voice.
[02:48:50.660 --> 02:48:55.060]   "My war band are currently resting after their exertions."
[02:48:55.060 --> 02:48:57.620]   "How many?"
[02:48:57.620 --> 02:48:58.620]   Gundl frowned.
[02:48:58.620 --> 02:49:01.780]   "Around three hundred," Jael said.
[02:49:01.780 --> 02:49:05.900]   "I'm not sure that counts as a war band."
[02:49:05.900 --> 02:49:08.620]   Gundl smiled slyly, and Jael's fingers twitched.
[02:49:08.620 --> 02:49:12.900]   "But even so, three hundred horses, I doubt I can spare so many.
[02:49:12.900 --> 02:49:16.500]   All my resources are going into building this road, you understand.
[02:49:16.500 --> 02:49:21.140]   I will reach Jassil before Lothar."
[02:49:21.140 --> 02:49:23.220]   So the race is still on.
[02:49:23.220 --> 02:49:27.820]   "Perhaps we can help each other, then," Jael said.
[02:49:27.820 --> 02:49:31.100]   "How could you possibly help me?"
[02:49:31.100 --> 02:49:35.100]   Gundl sneered, looking pointedly at Jael's tattered appearance.
[02:49:35.100 --> 02:49:38.980]   Jael bid back a harsh response and stood straighter.
[02:49:38.980 --> 02:49:43.900]   "I am still the king of Izeltyr.
[02:49:43.900 --> 02:49:47.180]   I could bring fresh workers to build your road.
[02:49:47.180 --> 02:49:49.100]   Two thousand at least.
[02:49:49.100 --> 02:49:51.500]   Maybe more."
[02:49:51.500 --> 02:49:55.540]   Gundl's smile broadened, and he sat straight in his chair, waving away the servants, offering
[02:49:55.540 --> 02:49:57.180]   him platters of food.
[02:49:57.180 --> 02:50:00.940]   "You shall have your horses," he said.
[02:50:00.940 --> 02:50:05.820]   Jael opened his mouth to speak but paused. The faint sound of shouting was filtering
[02:50:05.820 --> 02:50:08.820]   through the tense opening.
[02:50:08.820 --> 02:50:13.900]   Gundl heard it too and held his hand up to a man who was trying to whisper in his ear.
[02:50:13.900 --> 02:50:19.160]   The noises rapidly grew louder, shouts turning to screams, punctuated with the distinct sound
[02:50:19.160 --> 02:50:21.220]   of iron clashing.
[02:50:21.220 --> 02:50:26.260]   Jael glanced at Dag, who stood poised like an animal on the edge of flight, one hand
[02:50:26.260 --> 02:50:28.020]   upon the hilt of his dagger.
[02:50:28.020 --> 02:50:32.020]   "We need to leave," the huntsman hissed to Jael.
[02:50:32.020 --> 02:50:34.540]   "What is that?"
[02:50:34.540 --> 02:50:38.700]   Gundl snapped, standing, fear and worry flickering across his features.
[02:50:38.700 --> 02:50:45.820]   "It is battle, something that I don't think you are fully acquainted with."
[02:50:45.820 --> 02:50:50.460]   Gundl stroked from the tent, his gaggle of followers tight behind him.
[02:50:50.460 --> 02:50:54.260]   Jael and Dag slipped out after them.
[02:50:54.260 --> 02:50:58.420]   Inside, Gundl was stood on the slope of the hill, staring with a look of confused disbelief
[02:50:58.420 --> 02:51:02.340]   towards the northern fringe of his camp.
[02:51:02.340 --> 02:51:06.600]   Warriors were pouring onto the road from its far side, cutting into the milling guards
[02:51:06.600 --> 02:51:07.940]   and workers.
[02:51:07.940 --> 02:51:13.940]   Jael saw resistance sluggishly forming, warriors from Gundl's warband attempting to form a
[02:51:13.940 --> 02:51:18.340]   defensive line across the road but before they could organise themselves they were locked
[02:51:18.340 --> 02:51:21.460]   in combat with their assailants.
[02:51:21.460 --> 02:51:25.900]   In moments, the attackers had burst through the hastily formed resistance and were streaming
[02:51:25.900 --> 02:51:28.180]   down the embankment into the camp.
[02:51:28.180 --> 02:51:32.340]   "Asroth's stones, what now?"
[02:51:32.340 --> 02:51:37.300]   The jihar on the hillside were drawing close about Gundl, black eyes staring.
[02:51:37.300 --> 02:51:40.860]   "We need to get out of here," Dag repeated.
[02:51:40.860 --> 02:51:42.860]   "What's going on?"
[02:51:42.860 --> 02:51:46.340]   Gundl cried, part temper, part hysteria.
[02:51:46.340 --> 02:51:51.420]   "It would appear you were right," Jael said, not able to keep the smirk from
[02:51:51.420 --> 02:51:56.220]   his face at the sound of terror in Gundl's voice, even though he felt the coils of fear
[02:51:56.220 --> 02:51:58.380]   squirming in his own belly.
[02:51:58.380 --> 02:52:03.700]   "The enemy that you said did not know they were beaten, they appeared to be attacking
[02:52:03.700 --> 02:52:08.140]   you."
[02:52:08.140 --> 02:52:09.980]   Chapter 11
[02:52:09.980 --> 02:52:13.420]   McKean
[02:52:13.420 --> 02:52:18.180]   McKean gazed through foliage at the sprawling camp, feeling his body tense and fingers twitch
[02:52:18.180 --> 02:52:22.980]   for his knife hilt as he watched Corellus's men appear on the road and engage Gundl's
[02:52:22.980 --> 02:52:24.980]   men.
[02:52:24.980 --> 02:52:29.020]   Crouched on the far south of the camp, he saw a few dozen enemy guards standing with their
[02:52:29.020 --> 02:52:34.620]   backs to him in an open space cleared between the camp and the tree line.
[02:52:34.620 --> 02:52:37.580]   They looked unsure of what to do.
[02:52:37.580 --> 02:52:42.180]   The man beside McKean gripped his sword and took a step forwards.
[02:52:42.180 --> 02:52:47.860]   "Wait," McKean whispered, seizing the warrior's arm.
[02:52:47.860 --> 02:52:51.640]   "Wait till Corellus hits the camp."
[02:52:51.640 --> 02:52:56.380]   McKean had been given the command of a hundred men and they were spread loosely around him,
[02:52:56.380 --> 02:52:59.040]   hidden in the shadows and foliage.
[02:52:59.040 --> 02:53:02.660]   Only one thing had he said to them before they'd moved into position.
[02:53:02.660 --> 02:53:07.700]   "When I go, keep with me."
[02:53:07.700 --> 02:53:12.040]   Their task was to attack from the south and sweep up through the camp, spreading as much
[02:53:12.040 --> 02:53:16.020]   mayhem and panic along the way as was possible.
[02:53:16.020 --> 02:53:18.780]   McKean was unused to leading men.
[02:53:18.780 --> 02:53:22.900]   The Venthalan fighting pits had honed his will to survive, teaching him that above all
[02:53:22.900 --> 02:53:25.420]   else, you fight for yourself.
[02:53:25.420 --> 02:53:28.300]   "But that is what Lycra's wanted.
[02:53:28.300 --> 02:53:29.300]   To break me.
[02:53:29.300 --> 02:53:30.820]   To strip away my loyalties.
[02:53:30.820 --> 02:53:32.860]   To make me less than human.
[02:53:32.860 --> 02:53:35.820]   I will not be that man again."
[02:53:35.820 --> 02:53:40.260]   The main attack was to be led by Crellus, his first objective to clear the new road
[02:53:40.260 --> 02:53:42.140]   of all resistance.
[02:53:42.140 --> 02:53:47.380]   It was there that their scouts had reported most of Gundl's warband were to be found.
[02:53:47.380 --> 02:53:53.660]   Once the road was clear, Crellus was to assault the camp, which was the signal for the others.
[02:53:53.660 --> 02:53:58.380]   McKean and Albin were leading smaller groups hidden to the west and south of the camp.
[02:53:58.380 --> 02:54:03.380]   The plan was to meet Crellus and his force at the command tent, situated on a hill close
[02:54:03.380 --> 02:54:06.380]   to the camp's centre.
[02:54:06.380 --> 02:54:10.940]   At the thought of it, McKean's eyes drifted to the tent on the mound.
[02:54:10.940 --> 02:54:14.580]   One were appearing from its entrance, standing and staring at the commotion that Crellus
[02:54:14.580 --> 02:54:16.140]   was causing.
[02:54:16.140 --> 02:54:19.540]   "Gundl, it must be."
[02:54:19.540 --> 02:54:23.660]   Two other men emerged from the tent, hanging back from the rest.
[02:54:23.660 --> 02:54:30.700]   One of them seemed familiar in the way he walked, his posture, a confidence.
[02:54:30.700 --> 02:54:34.980]   Then dark clothed figures were appearing from around the hill, drawing tight about those
[02:54:34.980 --> 02:54:37.980]   who had emerged from the tent.
[02:54:37.980 --> 02:54:41.700]   And from this distance, there was something clearly different about them.
[02:54:41.700 --> 02:54:42.700]   Kalashim.
[02:54:42.700 --> 02:54:43.700]   Dammit.
[02:54:43.700 --> 02:54:49.940]   We're outnumbered as it is without those hells spawned to complicate things.
[02:54:49.940 --> 02:54:55.940]   He shrugged at himself, knew they were committed now and there was no turning back.
[02:54:55.940 --> 02:55:00.100]   And this whole attack was my idea, so I'd best be getting to that tent and making sure
[02:55:00.100 --> 02:55:02.900]   we win this thing.
[02:55:02.900 --> 02:55:07.020]   He looked back to the road and saw Crellus' warriors pouring down the embankment and into
[02:55:07.020 --> 02:55:08.500]   the camp.
[02:55:08.500 --> 02:55:10.220]   Good.
[02:55:10.220 --> 02:55:14.820]   With a battle cry, he exploded into motion, bursting from the tree line, drawing a knife
[02:55:14.820 --> 02:55:19.820]   in each hand as he sped towards the guard spread between him and the camp.
[02:55:19.820 --> 02:55:23.820]   A few paces behind him, his hundred followed.
[02:55:23.820 --> 02:55:27.820]   He heard a distant roar from the west, knew that Albin and his warriors were doing the
[02:55:27.820 --> 02:55:29.820]   same.
[02:55:29.820 --> 02:55:34.540]   McKean ducked a spear thrust and crashed into the man holding it, one of his knives punching
[02:55:34.540 --> 02:55:39.100]   through leather into flesh, ripping it free as his momentum carried him on, leaving the
[02:55:39.100 --> 02:55:42.900]   man on his knees, hands clutching at his belly.
[02:55:42.900 --> 02:55:48.140]   In moments, the guards along the camp's edge were either dead or fleeing, the sudden onslaught
[02:55:48.140 --> 02:55:51.660]   of McKean and his warriors too much for them.
[02:55:51.660 --> 02:55:56.140]   McKean gathered his warriors and charged into the camp, kicking at fires, smashing gates
[02:55:56.140 --> 02:56:01.820]   open, freeing cattle, hacking and slashing at anyone who got in their way.
[02:56:01.820 --> 02:56:07.380]   In heartbeats, flames were licking at tents and smoke was billowing, stampeding cattle
[02:56:07.380 --> 02:56:12.420]   knocked men flying, the whole world seemed to dissolve into chaos.
[02:56:12.420 --> 02:56:16.840]   McKean turned a corner and almost ran into a dozen warriors, the ensuing combat savage
[02:56:16.840 --> 02:56:21.480]   and short, McKean's knives finding throats and arteries as he slipped through them like
[02:56:21.480 --> 02:56:27.060]   a violent wind, the men following him crashing upon those still standing.
[02:56:27.060 --> 02:56:32.140]   He sped through the camp, a knife dripping blood in each hand, leaving a trail of bodies
[02:56:32.140 --> 02:56:34.240]   in his wake.
[02:56:34.240 --> 02:56:39.200]   As he travelled deeper, any kind of resistance melted away, those he came across ran from
[02:56:39.200 --> 02:56:41.940]   him and he was happy to let them go.
[02:56:41.940 --> 02:56:48.180]   For the most part, they were not gundles warriors but merchants, smiths, tanners, cobblers,
[02:56:48.180 --> 02:56:50.980]   drovers, whores and bands.
[02:56:50.980 --> 02:56:56.500]   I may be a killer, but I'll not slay the innocent.
[02:56:56.500 --> 02:57:01.100]   When the initial red mist of battle began to fade, any glance behind saw the black and
[02:57:01.100 --> 02:57:04.700]   silver of rippers warriors following him.
[02:57:04.700 --> 02:57:08.820]   Not used to leading men these days or being in a fight this big.
[02:57:08.820 --> 02:57:11.240]   Mustn't forget, they're with me.
[02:57:11.240 --> 02:57:14.660]   Mustn't forget the plan.
[02:57:14.660 --> 02:57:19.340]   Pausing, he gave his men a chance to gather behind him as he tried to get his bearings.
[02:57:19.340 --> 02:57:24.460]   Screams and the concussive clash of iron drifted down from the north.
[02:57:24.460 --> 02:57:26.300]   This sounds closer.
[02:57:26.300 --> 02:57:28.500]   Let's get to that command tent.
[02:57:28.500 --> 02:57:35.620]   Gundle must die for this to succeed and to do that, we must carve a way through his kadashim.
[02:57:35.620 --> 02:57:40.300]   He reached up to his shoulder and felt the hilt of a short sword, one of a pair strapped
[02:57:40.300 --> 02:57:42.340]   across his back.
[02:57:42.340 --> 02:57:47.860]   McKean preferred using his knives, but taking heads from kadashim was sword work.
[02:57:47.860 --> 02:57:50.060]   He set off again.
[02:57:50.060 --> 02:57:54.540]   Those packed tents suddenly gave way to an open space, cook fires spread about it, tents
[02:57:54.540 --> 02:57:57.260]   forming a loose circle.
[02:57:57.260 --> 02:57:59.220]   Weapons racks were rowed along one edge.
[02:57:59.220 --> 02:58:05.500]   A mass of men were pulling spears from stands, strapping on helms, hefting shields.
[02:58:05.500 --> 02:58:10.100]   McKean skidded to a halt, realising what he had stumbled upon.
[02:58:10.100 --> 02:58:13.780]   A barracks for the warriors of this warband.
[02:58:13.780 --> 02:58:16.660]   With a snarl, he ran at them.
[02:58:16.660 --> 02:58:19.520]   He hit a knot of men before they had any time to react.
[02:58:19.520 --> 02:58:23.260]   His knives tracing a red ruin across their bodies.
[02:58:23.260 --> 02:58:28.060]   In moments, he was through them and hurling himself at a new wall of men.
[02:58:28.060 --> 02:58:32.780]   Weapons thrust at him, but the battle rage was upon him, the world seeming to slow and
[02:58:32.780 --> 02:58:38.100]   he twisted and flowed around every blow aimed at him, his knives licking out to slice throats,
[02:58:38.100 --> 02:58:41.060]   puncture groins, cut hamstrings.
[02:58:41.060 --> 02:58:47.740]   Dimly, he heard the clash of arms behind him, knew his men were following.
[02:58:47.740 --> 02:58:51.380]   Weapons appeared before him grim, fearful, shocked.
[02:58:51.380 --> 02:58:54.860]   All fell to his twin blades.
[02:58:54.860 --> 02:58:57.140]   His progress slowed.
[02:58:57.140 --> 02:59:02.540]   The men crammed together now, his ability to move and sway hindered by a crush of bodies.
[02:59:02.540 --> 02:59:07.860]   A quick glance showed his men behind him, fighting furiously, but they were outnumbered
[02:59:07.860 --> 02:59:11.740]   and the enemy was beginning to curl around their flanks.
[02:59:11.740 --> 02:59:16.860]   Surprise and savagery had taken them so far, but had not broken their foe.
[02:59:16.860 --> 02:59:19.300]   Weapons are about to get messy.
[02:59:19.300 --> 02:59:23.980]   McKean stepped to the right, deflected a thrust aimed at the ribs of one of his men, slashed
[02:59:23.980 --> 02:59:28.540]   across the face of the attacker, kicked another in the knee, saw him buckle and stepped close
[02:59:28.540 --> 02:59:31.240]   to cut his throat.
[02:59:31.240 --> 02:59:36.860]   There was a great crash and a concussion that undulated through the hard-pressed warriors.
[02:59:36.860 --> 02:59:40.300]   Someone else joining this party.
[02:59:40.300 --> 02:59:46.780]   McKean glimpsed a giant figure, Alcion, wielding two woodsman's axes, as McKean was using his
[02:59:46.780 --> 02:59:51.860]   knives, carving a way through the enemy like a scythe at harvest time.
[02:59:51.860 --> 02:59:56.860]   Heads and limbs flew through the air in great gouts of blood.
[02:59:56.860 --> 02:59:58.860]   Albans crew.
[02:59:58.860 --> 03:00:03.980]   McKean grinned and leapt at his enemy, new strength powering his muscles.
[03:00:03.980 --> 03:00:07.940]   Within moments, Gundl's warriors were wavering, a ripple of doubt and fear spreading through
[03:00:07.940 --> 03:00:10.900]   them, and then they were fleeing.
[03:00:10.900 --> 03:00:14.780]   McKean buried a knife in a back, ripped it free and stood over the collapsing figure,
[03:00:14.780 --> 03:00:17.980]   gore covered and breathing heavily.
[03:00:17.980 --> 03:00:22.780]   He saw Alcion decapitate one more fleeing warrior, his wife Raynor and their son Tane
[03:00:22.780 --> 03:00:25.940]   either side of him, Albans warriors spread about them.
[03:00:25.940 --> 03:00:33.020]   "Well met," a voice said, and McKean turned to see Albans striding towards him.
[03:00:33.020 --> 03:00:38.060]   The old man was pale and had blood seeping from the bandage around his shoulder.
[03:00:38.060 --> 03:00:40.620]   I told him to stay at our camp.
[03:00:40.620 --> 03:00:43.840]   He'd have been better off there, and I'd have been happier knowing someone of his skill
[03:00:43.840 --> 03:00:46.460]   was guarding fiddly.
[03:00:46.460 --> 03:00:50.900]   He felt a wave of fear for her as he did every time that he was parted from her, but this
[03:00:50.900 --> 03:00:51.900]   was war.
[03:00:51.900 --> 03:00:55.960]   They both knew that she could not be here in the midst of this.
[03:00:55.960 --> 03:01:02.820]   "Well met," McKean replied, sheathing a knife and gripping the old man's arm.
[03:01:02.820 --> 03:01:04.860]   He left blood-stained fingerprints.
[03:01:04.860 --> 03:01:09.340]   "Think you might have just saved my skin."
[03:01:09.340 --> 03:01:13.580]   Alcion looked around at the bodies, piled about McKean and threw out the barrack ground.
[03:01:13.580 --> 03:01:16.900]   "I doubt that," he said.
[03:01:16.900 --> 03:01:21.060]   He glanced up through the rolling smoke at the hill that loomed not far away.
[03:01:21.060 --> 03:01:23.420]   "Gundle," McKean said.
[03:01:23.420 --> 03:01:26.620]   "Aye, let's go and find him."
[03:01:26.620 --> 03:01:28.980]   Both of their warbands were about them now.
[03:01:28.980 --> 03:01:32.540]   "There's caddishim on that hill," McKean said loudly.
[03:01:32.540 --> 03:01:35.220]   "They don't die easily, remember?
[03:01:35.220 --> 03:01:38.300]   You must take their heads."
[03:01:38.300 --> 03:01:41.500]   One and others nodded grimly.
[03:01:41.500 --> 03:01:45.420]   McKean grinned at them, then ran for the hill.
[03:01:45.420 --> 03:01:49.900]   Clouts of smoke billowed about him, parted for a moment, and he saw the hill, the huge
[03:01:49.900 --> 03:01:55.660]   and gaudy tent upon it strangely out of place in the sombre gloom of fawn.
[03:01:55.660 --> 03:02:01.100]   McKean ran faster, the camp a place of flame and shadow, the thud of his comrade's feet
[03:02:01.100 --> 03:02:05.540]   behind him, screams and battle cries swirling on the eddying smoke.
[03:02:05.540 --> 03:02:10.700]   Then the ground began to rise, and he burst from the haze and tents, Albon, Alcion and
[03:02:10.700 --> 03:02:14.340]   their men only a few paces behind him.
[03:02:14.340 --> 03:02:18.420]   Men were still on the hill, but they were retreating, at least three score of the caddishim
[03:02:18.420 --> 03:02:22.460]   that encircled them were herding them north-east towards the newest part of the road.
[03:02:22.460 --> 03:02:28.500]   They're fleeing, running for Drassil, and further along the road there'll be more reinforcements,
[03:02:28.500 --> 03:02:32.060]   can't let them reach that road.
[03:02:32.060 --> 03:02:37.580]   McKean sheathed his knives, and drew the two short swords as he ran.
[03:02:37.580 --> 03:02:40.660]   The space between them narrowed quickly.
[03:02:40.660 --> 03:02:44.900]   McKean and those with him were silent, no battle cries, only the drum of their feet
[03:02:44.900 --> 03:02:48.340]   and the jangle and creak of mail and leather.
[03:02:48.340 --> 03:02:53.500]   Appropriately, Gundl and the caddishim were aware of them, Gundl yelling orders.
[03:02:53.500 --> 03:02:58.180]   A score of the caddishim peeled away from the group, curved swords being drawn from
[03:02:58.180 --> 03:03:00.700]   behind their backs.
[03:03:00.700 --> 03:03:08.340]   One fixed its black eyes on McKean and ran at him, a dark grin splitting its pallid face.
[03:03:08.340 --> 03:03:12.700]   McKean felt a fist of fear squirm in his belly, remembering their ferocity and other-worldliness
[03:03:12.700 --> 03:03:15.620]   when he'd encountered them previously.
[03:03:15.620 --> 03:03:19.700]   He growled in anger at his own fear and ran faster.
[03:03:19.700 --> 03:03:23.900]   The first caddishim almost took his head, its sword whistling a finger's width above
[03:03:23.900 --> 03:03:29.380]   him as he threw himself into a roll, coming to his feet behind the creature, his own strike
[03:03:29.380 --> 03:03:34.020]   at its neck blocked with blinding speed, his second blade slicing through the back of its
[03:03:34.020 --> 03:03:37.260]   leg as it spun to face him.
[03:03:37.260 --> 03:03:43.020]   McKean leapt away, the creature stumbling as it tried to follow, its hamstrings cut.
[03:03:43.020 --> 03:03:47.880]   Even so, it was unnaturally fast, lurching after him.
[03:03:47.880 --> 03:03:52.660]   It should be on the ground, not still trying to gut me.
[03:03:52.660 --> 03:03:57.020]   All around him, his warriors were locked in combat with the caddishim.
[03:03:57.020 --> 03:03:59.700]   Little cries and death screams rang out.
[03:03:59.700 --> 03:04:05.500]   He glimpsed Albin take a head, saw that terrible black vapour fill the air.
[03:04:05.500 --> 03:04:09.140]   His distraction nearly cosmic in his life as his attacker launched a combination of
[03:04:09.140 --> 03:04:11.300]   two-handed blows at him.
[03:04:11.300 --> 03:04:15.820]   He parried two and slipped inside the third, instinctively punching a short sword into its
[03:04:15.820 --> 03:04:17.480]   belly.
[03:04:17.480 --> 03:04:23.300]   The caddishim's mouth gaped wide, foul breath washing over him as its teeth snapped, trying
[03:04:23.300 --> 03:04:25.420]   to fasten on his throat.
[03:04:25.420 --> 03:04:30.180]   He head-butted it, pushed away, leaving one sword in its belly, his other blade whistling
[03:04:30.180 --> 03:04:35.380]   around to crunch into its collarbone, blood and bone spraying as he wrenched it free and
[03:04:35.380 --> 03:04:40.180]   hacked again, this time cutting deep into the creature's neck.
[03:04:40.180 --> 03:04:45.540]   He darted in, swerving away from its curved sword, chopping at its neck to finish the
[03:04:45.540 --> 03:04:47.140]   job.
[03:04:47.140 --> 03:04:51.540]   Somehow the caddishim's hand snaked out and caught his blade in its fist.
[03:04:51.540 --> 03:04:56.100]   A finger flew through the air but still it held on as it tried to bring its own sword
[03:04:56.100 --> 03:04:58.580]   round to bear.
[03:04:58.580 --> 03:05:02.980]   Makiin grabbed its sword-wrist and for a few heart-boots they lurched together in an ungainly
[03:05:02.980 --> 03:05:04.820]   dance.
[03:05:04.820 --> 03:05:08.020]   Within seconds Makiin knew he could not win a contest of strength.
[03:05:08.020 --> 03:05:10.300]   The caddishim's grip was unnaturally strong.
[03:05:10.300 --> 03:05:15.740]   Then, in the blink of an eye, its head was spinning through the air and Albin's face
[03:05:15.740 --> 03:05:17.980]   appeared before him.
[03:05:17.980 --> 03:05:22.800]   The caddishim's body slumped, fists still gripped around Makiin's sword blade, oily
[03:05:22.800 --> 03:05:27.060]   black smoke pouring from the open wound of its neck.
[03:05:27.060 --> 03:05:32.380]   A winged creature formed in the air above him and screamed wordless hatred at him.
[03:05:32.380 --> 03:05:36.460]   Then the wind caught it and it was gone.
[03:05:36.460 --> 03:05:40.380]   Makiin sagged, Albin's hand reaching out to steady him.
[03:05:40.380 --> 03:05:46.620]   "There's no getting used to that," Makiin breathed as he yanked his swords free of the
[03:05:46.620 --> 03:05:49.060]   caddishim's corpse.
[03:05:49.060 --> 03:05:55.860]   He looked around, saw more of the demon forms appearing in the air above them and then evaporating.
[03:05:55.860 --> 03:06:00.900]   At a glance, it seemed that most of those caddishim that had attacked them had fallen,
[03:06:00.900 --> 03:06:06.700]   though many of Makiin's and Albin's men were lying still and silent upon the ground.
[03:06:06.700 --> 03:06:12.940]   As Makiin watched, Alcyon, Reina and Tane dispatched the last caddishim.
[03:06:12.940 --> 03:06:14.740]   "Gundle?"
[03:06:14.740 --> 03:06:16.300]   Makiin breathed.
[03:06:16.300 --> 03:06:20.900]   "Down there," Albin gestured.
[03:06:20.900 --> 03:06:25.140]   Makiin saw the king of Carnotan disappearing amongst the tents, far more caddishim still
[03:06:25.140 --> 03:06:28.180]   about him than Makiin had hoped to see.
[03:06:28.180 --> 03:06:30.320]   Two men were moving with them.
[03:06:30.320 --> 03:06:33.460]   One of them paused as the others disappeared from view and looked back.
[03:06:33.460 --> 03:06:36.500]   For a moment, Makiin's eyes locked with him.
[03:06:36.500 --> 03:06:40.420]   He staggered, felt as if he'd just been punched in the gut.
[03:06:40.420 --> 03:06:43.420]   "It cannot be."
[03:06:43.420 --> 03:06:48.500]   Makiin's heart was suddenly pounding in his chest, a wave of shock spilling into fury.
[03:06:48.500 --> 03:06:49.500]   "Jael."
[03:06:49.500 --> 03:06:55.980]   CHAPTER XII.
[03:06:55.980 --> 03:06:59.140]   Jael.
[03:06:59.140 --> 03:07:02.660]   Jael stood and stared at the warriors on the hill.
[03:07:02.660 --> 03:07:10.260]   One man had emerged ahead of the others, blood-soaked and battle-grim, a short sword in each hand.
[03:07:10.260 --> 03:07:14.720]   He was staring back at Jael, and although they were a good hundred paces apart, Jael
[03:07:14.720 --> 03:07:18.180]   was certain he saw a hatred twist the man's features.
[03:07:18.180 --> 03:07:20.980]   "There is something familiar about him."
[03:07:20.980 --> 03:07:29.560]   "My lord," Dag said, pulling at his sleeve, "we must keep moving."
[03:07:29.560 --> 03:07:34.980]   They were following the jihar that was shepherding Gundle and his retinue of lackeys to safety,
[03:07:34.980 --> 03:07:38.980]   hoping that the jihar would guard Jael and Dag as well as the others as they passed through
[03:07:38.980 --> 03:07:41.540]   the camp.
[03:07:41.540 --> 03:07:45.340]   Jael had heard the sounds of battle from the hilltop and paused to watch the bloody work
[03:07:45.340 --> 03:07:49.500]   of the handful of jihar warriors that had remained behind.
[03:07:49.500 --> 03:07:55.900]   They had fallen, but then it was a score against close to two hundred, and even so, the jihar
[03:07:55.900 --> 03:07:59.020]   had decimated their enemy.
[03:07:59.020 --> 03:08:04.660]   As Jael stared, he saw the man burst into motion, running hard towards him, screaming
[03:08:04.660 --> 03:08:05.660]   Jael's name.
[03:08:05.660 --> 03:08:08.300]   "He knows me."
[03:08:08.300 --> 03:08:09.780]   Jael took an involuntary step back.
[03:08:09.780 --> 03:08:12.580]   "Doesn't seem to like me much, though."
[03:08:12.580 --> 03:08:13.580]   "Who?"
[03:08:13.580 --> 03:08:15.740]   Then he knew.
[03:08:15.740 --> 03:08:17.780]   "McKean."
[03:08:17.780 --> 03:08:21.900]   He had changed almost beyond all recognition, slimmer than Jael remembered him.
[03:08:21.900 --> 03:08:28.580]   His body chiseled, arms and legs a striated mass of muscle, face a place of ridges, scars,
[03:08:28.580 --> 03:08:30.860]   and hate-filled eyes.
[03:08:30.860 --> 03:08:33.380]   "How is he here?"
[03:08:33.380 --> 03:08:40.260]   "He should be dead, or at least a thousand leagues from here, and in shackles."
[03:08:40.260 --> 03:08:44.260]   Jael remembered the last time he had seen McKean on the bridge at Dunkelon, chained
[03:08:44.260 --> 03:08:49.220]   and being dragged away by Lycra's to a Vinfallon slave ship.
[03:08:49.220 --> 03:08:54.940]   The fool had challenged me to the court of swords, insulted me in front of my men.
[03:08:54.940 --> 03:09:00.580]   From the look on McKean's face, that court of swords was still high on his agenda.
[03:09:00.580 --> 03:09:05.780]   Jael gulped. If McKean's expression did not convince him that it was time to go, the warriors
[03:09:05.780 --> 03:09:09.220]   charging down the hill behind McKean did.
[03:09:09.220 --> 03:09:12.220]   There were giants amongst him.
[03:09:12.220 --> 03:09:18.460]   This way, Dag snapped at him as they entered a maze of tents, banks of thick smoke rolling
[03:09:18.460 --> 03:09:24.220]   through it, the shouts and screams of battle drifting and swirling all about them.
[03:09:24.220 --> 03:09:27.660]   Footsteps drummed on the turf of the hill somewhere behind him, and the jihar were nowhere
[03:09:27.660 --> 03:09:29.340]   to be seen.
[03:09:29.340 --> 03:09:31.820]   McKean clenched a fist in his gut.
[03:09:31.820 --> 03:09:38.260]   "Jael," a voice screamed behind him, "keep running."
[03:09:38.260 --> 03:09:44.400]   Then he saw Dag, the huntsman moving fast, head dipped, scanning the ground.
[03:09:44.400 --> 03:09:49.500]   Jael followed him around a tent, ran down an empty isle of churned mud and barrels piled
[03:09:49.500 --> 03:09:55.020]   high, then turned again and saw the dark figures of the jihar hurrying ahead of them.
[03:09:55.020 --> 03:09:59.240]   Leaf swept him, and he picked up his pace, he and Dag steadily catching up with Gundl
[03:09:59.240 --> 03:10:00.240]   and his protectors.
[03:10:00.240 --> 03:10:06.300]   They were close to the jihar now, only a score of paces separating them.
[03:10:06.300 --> 03:10:10.060]   A final burst of speed, and Jael was at their heels.
[03:10:10.060 --> 03:10:13.540]   He tried to shoulder his way between two of them and enter their protective circle, but
[03:10:13.540 --> 03:10:16.860]   one turned and fixed him with its black, dead eyes.
[03:10:16.860 --> 03:10:24.380]   "Let me through," Jael gasped. "I am Jael, King of Izaldir. You must protect me."
[03:10:24.380 --> 03:10:30.300]   The jihar warrior cocked its head at him, then it pushed Jael back, sending him stumbling.
[03:10:30.300 --> 03:10:31.780]   Dag reached out and steadied him.
[03:10:31.780 --> 03:10:40.380]   "Shouldn't have left my men on the roadside. Neither! My! Men!" Jael breathed to Dag.
[03:10:40.380 --> 03:10:45.500]   "The English lard are going that way," Dag said, " safer to travel with them."
[03:10:45.500 --> 03:10:49.500]   "Aye," Jael muttered.
[03:10:49.500 --> 03:10:53.820]   He saw Dag surreptitiously glance down corridors made by rows of tents.
[03:10:53.820 --> 03:11:00.020]   He looks as if he's thinking of slinking off, but probably do the same if I was him.
[03:11:00.020 --> 03:11:05.140]   "Gold!" Jael hacked out of his burning lungs. "I need this man."
[03:11:05.140 --> 03:11:06.140]   "What?"
[03:11:06.140 --> 03:11:12.300]   "Gold, for you. When you get me to Mikil. More than you can carry, more than you've ever
[03:11:12.300 --> 03:11:13.300]   dreamed of."
[03:11:13.300 --> 03:11:17.660]   "I've dreamed of a line of gold in my time," Dag said.
[03:11:17.660 --> 03:11:20.140]   "You've earned it," Jael breathed.
[03:11:20.140 --> 03:11:24.540]   "What can I have?" Dag muttered.
[03:11:24.540 --> 03:11:26.820]   A greedy smile crept across his face.
[03:11:26.820 --> 03:11:31.800]   "I'll get you to Mikil," the huntsman said.
[03:11:31.800 --> 03:11:36.700]   The sounds of battle suddenly grew louder. A knot of enemy warriors clothed in black
[03:11:36.700 --> 03:11:42.020]   and silver appeared ahead of them. They looked like N'Thayr's colours.
[03:11:42.020 --> 03:11:47.780]   Jael drew his sword as a warrior lurched before him. One of Gundl's men, his sword wildly
[03:11:47.780 --> 03:11:52.500]   parrying a flurry of blows from a warrior in black and silver.
[03:11:52.500 --> 03:11:56.700]   Jael stabbed his sword into the attacker's side. Ripping his sword free, he pushed the
[03:11:56.700 --> 03:12:01.220]   dying man away and leapt over him, eyes searching for Dag, his heart pounding desperately when
[03:12:01.220 --> 03:12:02.820]   he could not see him.
[03:12:02.820 --> 03:12:06.500]   "This way!" Dag called to him.
[03:12:06.500 --> 03:12:09.140]   Something slammed into Jael's back.
[03:12:09.140 --> 03:12:13.300]   He flew through the air, weightless for a moment, then hit the ground, air crushed from
[03:12:13.300 --> 03:12:17.300]   his lungs, and he was sliding in the mud, rolling.
[03:12:17.300 --> 03:12:21.600]   He came to a stop and rose to one knee, trying to ignore the pain in his chest and shoulder,
[03:12:21.600 --> 03:12:25.780]   hand grasping for his sword hilt, looking back to see a lunatic covered in blood rising
[03:12:25.780 --> 03:12:27.180]   from the ground.
[03:12:27.180 --> 03:12:28.180]   "Makin!"
[03:12:28.180 --> 03:12:32.700]   "Run!" Jael's mind screamed at him, but he knew he would not make it.
[03:12:32.700 --> 03:12:35.720]   Makin was too close for him to make a safe escape.
[03:12:35.720 --> 03:12:38.300]   Jael rose to his feet and hefted his sword.
[03:12:38.300 --> 03:12:44.420]   "I am the finest sword in Izeltyr. I slew Castellan single combat and he was a great
[03:12:44.420 --> 03:12:50.100]   swordsman in his prime, not old and half mad like this man before me."
[03:12:50.100 --> 03:12:53.780]   He set his feet and raised his blade.
[03:12:53.780 --> 03:12:58.660]   The world around him faded, the battle raging only a handful of strides away, dimmed as
[03:12:58.660 --> 03:13:03.660]   a cold focus settled upon him, as it always did when he committed to the blade.
[03:13:03.660 --> 03:13:09.100]   "Come," he shouted, "and I'll send you to meet Castell."
[03:13:09.100 --> 03:13:15.700]   He thought to anger Makin, unbalance him with rage, as angry men make mistakes.
[03:13:15.700 --> 03:13:19.140]   By the look on Makin's face his tactic worked.
[03:13:19.140 --> 03:13:24.060]   The man gripped his second blade and launched himself forwards, face twisted and snarled.
[03:13:24.060 --> 03:13:27.140]   "He's moving too fast."
[03:13:27.140 --> 03:13:31.300]   The smile twitched at Jael's lips as he stepped forwards to meet Makin, lunging as he did
[03:13:31.300 --> 03:13:35.020]   so, his sword tip aimed straight at Makin's heart.
[03:13:35.020 --> 03:13:40.060]   His own speed will impale him the idiot, he's a dead man.
[03:13:40.060 --> 03:13:46.460]   But then, Jael was stabbing into empty air, Makin no longer where he was supposed to be.
[03:13:46.460 --> 03:13:52.020]   A blow slammed into Jael's side, crunching into his ribs, white pain exploding in his
[03:13:52.020 --> 03:13:54.860]   chest as he dropped to one knee.
[03:13:54.860 --> 03:13:57.740]   The sudden urge to vomit almost consumed him.
[03:13:57.740 --> 03:14:03.680]   "He's broken my ribs," he realised in shock, his hand probing at his side, all the chain
[03:14:03.680 --> 03:14:05.620]   mail links bent and broken.
[03:14:05.620 --> 03:14:08.900]   "Move or die."
[03:14:08.900 --> 03:14:13.600]   Jael heaved himself to his feet, raised his sword and pivoted on his heel, but the expected
[03:14:13.600 --> 03:14:15.460]   blow never came at him.
[03:14:15.460 --> 03:14:19.620]   Instead, Makin was standing a few paces away, just staring at him.
[03:14:19.620 --> 03:14:26.300]   "I've waited a long time for this," Makin said, his voice as cold and hard as frosted
[03:14:26.300 --> 03:14:27.300]   iron.
[03:14:27.300 --> 03:14:31.980]   "Healing you quicks too good for you."
[03:14:31.980 --> 03:14:36.780]   A seed of fear blossomed in Jael's chest, the utter confidence in Makin's eyes chilling
[03:14:36.780 --> 03:14:37.780]   him.
[03:14:37.780 --> 03:14:43.220]   "Don't be a fool, I've watched him train on the weapons court, I know his strengths,
[03:14:43.220 --> 03:14:47.860]   his weaknesses, he's old, slow, I know I can beat him."
[03:14:47.860 --> 03:14:56.700]   "Castell said something similar just before I bled him like a sow," Jael said, trying
[03:14:56.700 --> 03:15:00.340]   to keep the pain of his splintered ribs out of his voice.
[03:15:00.340 --> 03:15:03.700]   Nothing came at him, slowly this time.
[03:15:03.700 --> 03:15:07.980]   Jael noticed knife-hilts protruding from half a dozen places on Makin, two on his belt,
[03:15:07.980 --> 03:15:12.520]   a shoulder strap, a hilt poking from a boot.
[03:15:12.520 --> 03:15:15.980]   One of Makin's short swords trailed a lazy circle as the battle-scarred warrior rolled
[03:15:15.980 --> 03:15:21.820]   a wrist, then, almost faster than Jael could follow, Makin was striking at him.
[03:15:21.820 --> 03:15:26.580]   Jael staggered backwards, pain from his ribs exploding with every breath and step as he
[03:15:26.580 --> 03:15:30.380]   blocked Makin's blows, each parry more ragged than the last.
[03:15:30.380 --> 03:15:35.960]   "He's as fast as the Jihar, it's impossible, what's happened to him?"
[03:15:35.960 --> 03:15:40.620]   Panic threatened Jael now as a line of white fire ignited along one thigh when Makin cut
[03:15:40.620 --> 03:15:45.520]   him, moving too fast for him to defend against another wound appearing on his forearm, a
[03:15:45.520 --> 03:15:51.540]   slash across his forehead sending him tumbling backwards as blood sheeted into his eyes.
[03:15:51.540 --> 03:15:55.580]   Jael lay on his back, an arm wiping the blood from his eyes.
[03:15:55.580 --> 03:16:00.820]   Looking up, he saw grey sky veiled by the trees of fawn and then Makin appeared, looming
[03:16:00.820 --> 03:16:02.420]   over him.
[03:16:02.420 --> 03:16:07.780]   His face was latticed with scars, one ear mostly gone, just a lump of flesh remaining,
[03:16:07.780 --> 03:16:11.020]   his hair more grey than black.
[03:16:11.020 --> 03:16:15.740]   Jael searched the ground for the hilt of his sword, felt its worn leather and snatched
[03:16:15.740 --> 03:16:16.740]   at it.
[03:16:16.740 --> 03:16:22.060]   Makin's boot crunched into his ribs as the old warrior kicked him.
[03:16:22.060 --> 03:16:26.340]   Jael screamed, rolled over, vomited bile into the mud.
[03:16:26.340 --> 03:16:33.620]   "When you see Castell, be sure and tell him I kept my oath," Makin said above him.
[03:16:33.620 --> 03:16:37.580]   "This can't be happening, he's old."
[03:16:37.580 --> 03:16:41.740]   Jael rolled onto his back, arms raised, wanting to beg for mercy but he couldn't seem to get
[03:16:41.740 --> 03:16:47.620]   his lungs to work properly, only a blubbering wheeze came from his gaping mouth.
[03:16:47.620 --> 03:16:53.380]   Makin raised one of his swords, then there was a crunch and Makin was gone.
[03:16:53.380 --> 03:16:57.500]   He turned his head and saw Makin born to the ground grappling with another figure, small
[03:16:57.500 --> 03:16:58.500]   and wiry.
[03:16:58.500 --> 03:17:02.340]   "Dag, I love that man."
[03:17:02.340 --> 03:17:06.780]   Jael climbed to his knees, grabbed his sword and leaven himself to his feet, a wave of
[03:17:06.780 --> 03:17:11.660]   dizziness and nausea threatening him as his broken ribs complained.
[03:17:11.660 --> 03:17:16.660]   All around him, men were fighting, the jihar seemingly reduced to a handful and more men
[03:17:16.660 --> 03:17:20.020]   in black and silver joining the battle.
[03:17:20.020 --> 03:17:22.460]   Gundl and his protectors were nowhere to be seen.
[03:17:22.460 --> 03:17:25.700]   "I need to get out of here."
[03:17:25.700 --> 03:17:30.300]   Makin and Dag were still fighting, Makin's short swords lying in the mud, a knife glinting
[03:17:30.300 --> 03:17:33.060]   in Dag's fist.
[03:17:33.060 --> 03:17:38.900]   Jael stumbled towards them, raised his sword, waiting for a clear thrust at Makin.
[03:17:38.900 --> 03:17:42.880]   A new battle cry rose up, this one deep and alien.
[03:17:42.880 --> 03:17:46.620]   The giant he had seen in Makin's company had appeared from out of the smoke and chaos,
[03:17:46.620 --> 03:17:52.020]   two more giants behind him as well as a knot of warriors in black and silver.
[03:17:52.020 --> 03:17:57.300]   The first giant saw him and bellowed, then charged at him, all those behind him following.
[03:17:57.300 --> 03:17:59.900]   Jael felt the ground tremble.
[03:17:59.900 --> 03:18:01.740]   He glanced down at Dag and Makin.
[03:18:01.740 --> 03:18:04.500]   "I need Makin dead and Dag alive.
[03:18:04.500 --> 03:18:08.360]   He is going to get me back to Izeltir."
[03:18:08.360 --> 03:18:13.500]   Jael looked back up at the onrushing giant and the swarm of sharp iron behind it.
[03:18:13.500 --> 03:18:19.900]   He turned and ran.
[03:18:19.900 --> 03:18:25.380]   Chapter 13 FIDELAY
[03:18:25.380 --> 03:18:28.780]   FIDELAY paced around the cold ash of the firepit.
[03:18:28.780 --> 03:18:32.980]   In the distance she could hear the screams of battle and the clash of iron.
[03:18:32.980 --> 03:18:38.700]   "They say I am Queen, that I must do my duty and lead the men of Tenebrau, yet they leave
[03:18:38.700 --> 03:18:43.020]   me here with a score of men guarded like a prisoner.
[03:18:43.020 --> 03:18:45.200]   To keep me safe.
[03:18:45.200 --> 03:18:47.420]   How is this leading?"
[03:18:47.420 --> 03:18:49.740]   She muttered a string of curses under her breath.
[03:18:49.740 --> 03:18:53.000]   Some of the shield men left to guard her, glanced at her.
[03:18:53.000 --> 03:18:55.340]   A smile twitched the mouth of one.
[03:18:55.340 --> 03:18:58.740]   "I should not be here."
[03:18:58.740 --> 03:19:02.900]   When Makin had suggested the attack on Gundl's camp, she had known instantly that it was
[03:19:02.900 --> 03:19:07.700]   the right thing to do and the thought of doing, of attacking instead of running, had its own
[03:19:07.700 --> 03:19:10.020]   heady appeal.
[03:19:10.020 --> 03:19:15.140]   They had seen the others warm to the idea quickly and had felt a jolt of pride in Makin,
[03:19:15.140 --> 03:19:17.980]   seeing him listen to by the lords of Rippa.
[03:19:17.980 --> 03:19:20.220]   Not that it had surprised her.
[03:19:20.220 --> 03:19:24.540]   She had recognised something rare in Makin during their escape through Tenebrau, intelligence
[03:19:24.540 --> 03:19:27.860]   and strength and a lack of ego.
[03:19:27.860 --> 03:19:31.740]   He had the ability to look at a situation and know what had to be done and then to do
[03:19:31.740 --> 03:19:36.580]   it with absolute commitment or die in the trying.
[03:19:36.580 --> 03:19:41.920]   Small screams echoed through the forest, the din of battle ebbing and flowing and she ground
[03:19:41.920 --> 03:19:43.500]   her teeth in frustration.
[03:19:43.500 --> 03:19:49.980]   "I will not be a bystander or a leader that does not lead."
[03:19:49.980 --> 03:19:54.260]   She brushed the knife hilt at her belt and strode away from the cold fire pit towards
[03:19:54.260 --> 03:20:01.300]   a rack of weapons, gripped a slim-shafted spear and hefted it, testing its weight.
[03:20:01.300 --> 03:20:05.780]   For a moment she was back in Tenebrau, in the forest with Makin, fighting her fear as
[03:20:05.780 --> 03:20:10.060]   she plunged a spear into the throat of a Vintalan warrior.
[03:20:10.060 --> 03:20:13.820]   "My lady," one of the warriors said, questioning me.
[03:20:13.820 --> 03:20:17.900]   "I am going to the battle," Fidelei said.
[03:20:17.900 --> 03:20:22.220]   "What is that, wise?"
[03:20:22.220 --> 03:20:23.580]   The warrior blinked.
[03:20:23.580 --> 03:20:27.380]   "My lady," he added.
[03:20:27.380 --> 03:20:28.380]   He was not young.
[03:20:28.380 --> 03:20:32.340]   By the look of him he was a veteran of battle, a scar running through the red and silver
[03:20:32.340 --> 03:20:34.400]   of his beard.
[03:20:34.400 --> 03:20:36.900]   But unused to talking to queens it appears.
[03:20:36.900 --> 03:20:40.400]   "What is your name?" she asked him.
[03:20:40.400 --> 03:20:43.820]   "Agost, my lady," he said.
[03:20:43.820 --> 03:20:47.220]   "Well, Agost, I am going to see how the battle fares."
[03:20:47.220 --> 03:20:56.020]   "But, Albon, is not my lord and does not command me," Fidelei finished for him.
[03:20:56.020 --> 03:20:59.180]   "My people are out there, fighting.
[03:20:59.180 --> 03:21:00.780]   My place is with them.
[03:21:00.780 --> 03:21:04.380]   I have seen war and dark deeds," she continued, louder.
[03:21:04.380 --> 03:21:10.460]   "I am no stranger to blood, and right now the men of Tenebrel are spilling theirs.
[03:21:10.460 --> 03:21:13.880]   I'll not stand hidden and await the outcome.
[03:21:13.880 --> 03:21:19.020]   Though we are few in number, we could still be needed at some hard-pressed moment.
[03:21:19.020 --> 03:21:22.580]   Battles have turned on less."
[03:21:22.580 --> 03:21:26.940]   She looked around at their faces, saw the eagerness in their eyes, knew they did not
[03:21:26.940 --> 03:21:32.180]   want to be standing guard over her when their shield brothers were dying.
[03:21:32.180 --> 03:21:39.220]   With that, she gripped her spear like a staff and marched resolutely out of the camp.
[03:21:39.220 --> 03:21:44.020]   The sound of battle grew steadily louder as they moved through the forest, Agost and a
[03:21:44.020 --> 03:21:48.980]   few others slipping in front of her, a protective hand.
[03:21:48.980 --> 03:21:53.020]   Agost paused, held his hand up, and they stopped.
[03:21:53.020 --> 03:21:54.020]   "What?"
[03:21:54.020 --> 03:21:55.420]   Fidelei whispered.
[03:21:55.420 --> 03:22:00.820]   "Someone's out there," Agost said, pointing deeper into the forest away from the sound
[03:22:00.820 --> 03:22:02.780]   of battle.
[03:22:02.780 --> 03:22:06.020]   He signaled and a handful of men followed him into the trees, disappearing into the
[03:22:06.020 --> 03:22:07.020]   shadows.
[03:22:07.020 --> 03:22:13.980]   For a hundred heartbeats, Fidelei heard nothing, then shouting a clash of iron.
[03:22:13.980 --> 03:22:14.980]   "Voices."
[03:22:14.980 --> 03:22:20.100]   "My lady," Agost's voice called, and Fidelei stepped through the trees, the remainder
[03:22:20.100 --> 03:22:22.900]   of her guard about her.
[03:22:22.900 --> 03:22:27.540]   Agost and his warriors stood with three men, all clothed in leather and fur, beards braided
[03:22:27.540 --> 03:22:30.300]   and bound with leather.
[03:22:30.300 --> 03:22:34.940]   Tears hung at their belts, single-bladed and short-hafted.
[03:22:34.940 --> 03:22:38.180]   There was a hardness about these men that Fidelei was used to seeing in veterans of
[03:22:38.180 --> 03:22:39.180]   battle.
[03:22:39.180 --> 03:22:43.340]   "Tell her what you told me," Agost said.
[03:22:43.340 --> 03:22:48.100]   "We come from Drasil," one said, "sent south in search of allies."
[03:22:48.100 --> 03:22:50.000]   "Allies for whom?"
[03:22:50.000 --> 03:22:51.000]   Fidelei asked.
[03:22:51.000 --> 03:22:52.740]   "Who do you fight for?"
[03:22:52.740 --> 03:23:00.100]   "We fight for Corbin, the bright star," the three men said together.
[03:23:00.100 --> 03:23:08.100]   Chapter 14, McKean
[03:23:08.100 --> 03:23:12.860]   McKean rolled in the dirt, grunting as his attacker butted him in the mouth.
[03:23:12.860 --> 03:23:18.260]   He spat blood into the man's face, butted him back and felt the grip on his wrist loosen.
[03:23:18.260 --> 03:23:22.820]   Then he was rolling free, pulling a knife from his boot.
[03:23:22.820 --> 03:23:25.460]   The man facing him climbed to his feet.
[03:23:25.460 --> 03:23:30.780]   He was small, lean with wiry muscle, face a burn-scarred mess.
[03:23:30.780 --> 03:23:32.700]   "We have much in common."
[03:23:32.700 --> 03:23:39.420]   "Whatever he promised you, jail's not worth it," McKean growled.
[03:23:39.420 --> 03:23:45.260]   "Gold's always worth it," the man snarled back, pulling a knife of his own from a sheath
[03:23:45.260 --> 03:23:47.420]   at his back.
[03:23:47.420 --> 03:23:53.460]   McKean lunged in, their blades clashing, sparking, McKean ducking a hooked punch, pivoting away,
[03:23:53.460 --> 03:23:57.780]   swaying back in close, knife stabbing for his enemy's throat.
[03:23:57.780 --> 03:24:00.660]   He was blocked, the man backing away.
[03:24:00.660 --> 03:24:06.860]   They parted and circled, McKean crouched and circling like a stalking wolf.
[03:24:06.860 --> 03:24:09.380]   A bellowing roar rang out.
[03:24:09.380 --> 03:24:11.460]   McKean's eyes were drawn to the battle about them.
[03:24:11.460 --> 03:24:15.860]   Alcion was there, hacking with his two woodsman's axes at a kadashim that were standing over
[03:24:15.860 --> 03:24:17.900]   another giant figure.
[03:24:17.900 --> 03:24:19.860]   Alcion's son?
[03:24:19.860 --> 03:24:25.380]   The kadashim's head arched through the air, black mist hissing from the collapsing corpse.
[03:24:25.380 --> 03:24:29.420]   A scuffing of earth drew McKean back to his enemy.
[03:24:29.420 --> 03:24:33.180]   He swayed left, avoided a knife in the eye, kicked out.
[03:24:33.180 --> 03:24:36.580]   His foot, connecting with a knee, heard cartilage crunch.
[03:24:36.580 --> 03:24:41.260]   Then McKean was in close, plunging his knife into his enemy's belly.
[03:24:41.260 --> 03:24:45.780]   He twisted the blade, ripped it free and shoved the slumping figure away.
[03:24:45.780 --> 03:24:51.540]   "Can't take gold where you're going," McKean grunted at the dying man.
[03:24:51.540 --> 03:24:56.780]   He didn't answer, eyes already glazing and vacant.
[03:24:56.780 --> 03:24:59.060]   The battle around him was all but done.
[03:24:59.060 --> 03:25:03.900]   The kadashim that had fallen back from Gundl's honor guard all slain, though many men had
[03:25:03.900 --> 03:25:05.980]   fallen to their blades.
[03:25:05.980 --> 03:25:11.100]   A scattering of Gundl's other warriors were still fighting against the black and silver
[03:25:11.100 --> 03:25:15.140]   of Krellus's men, but they were all but broken.
[03:25:15.140 --> 03:25:21.760]   McKean stared into the distance, searching for JL, but I know the direction he was running.
[03:25:21.760 --> 03:25:25.660]   His eyes lifted over the tents to look towards the road and embankment that cut into Fawn
[03:25:25.660 --> 03:25:30.860]   Forest, fastest way out of here.
[03:25:30.860 --> 03:25:35.100]   Alcion and Rhaenar were lifting their sun from the ground.
[03:25:35.100 --> 03:25:39.540]   McKean approached them, retrieving his short swords as he did so.
[03:25:39.540 --> 03:25:43.900]   The giant ling was loose-limbed, a cut on his temple's swelling, but other than that,
[03:25:43.900 --> 03:25:45.340]   he looked well enough.
[03:25:45.340 --> 03:25:52.580]   "He'll live," McKean said, "then my thanks for following me."
[03:25:52.580 --> 03:25:54.180]   The giant shrugged.
[03:25:54.180 --> 03:26:02.140]   "Rhaenar has spoken to me of you, of what you did for her and Tane."
[03:26:02.140 --> 03:26:04.340]   McKean didn't know what to say about that.
[03:26:04.340 --> 03:26:07.500]   He looked beyond the giant, saw a scattering of the warriors who had been put under his
[03:26:07.500 --> 03:26:11.780]   command realize that the sight of JL had driven all else from his mind.
[03:26:11.780 --> 03:26:18.660]   "Albin," he asked, "on the hill, waiting for Krellis," the giant said.
[03:26:18.660 --> 03:26:25.180]   "I'm here," a voice called, Krellis emerging from an aisle between tents.
[03:26:25.180 --> 03:26:26.820]   He was blood-soaked and grinning.
[03:26:26.820 --> 03:26:32.220]   "Remind me to listen to you next time you say you have a plan," he said to McKean.
[03:26:32.220 --> 03:26:36.300]   "The plan's not done until Gondal's dead," McKean said.
[03:26:36.300 --> 03:26:40.980]   "Aye, where is that little snot-nosed arse-ling?
[03:26:40.980 --> 03:26:43.260]   Got him trussed up on the hill?"
[03:26:43.260 --> 03:26:45.300]   "No," McKean grunted.
[03:26:45.300 --> 03:26:48.500]   "He's fled with a few score cadreshem about him."
[03:26:48.500 --> 03:26:51.140]   "That way," he pointed.
[03:26:51.140 --> 03:26:56.460]   "Well, what we doing standing here flapping our jaws, then?"
[03:26:56.460 --> 03:26:59.780]   "Just what I was thinking."
[03:26:59.780 --> 03:27:04.460]   Krellis tugged on his beard, eyes narrowing, as he looked the way Gondal had fled.
[03:27:04.460 --> 03:27:08.900]   "Best go and tell Albin to follow us," Krellis said to McKean.
[03:27:08.900 --> 03:27:12.780]   "We'll need all the swords we can muster against those damn cadreshem."
[03:27:12.780 --> 03:27:17.060]   "Send someone else," McKean said as he strode away.
[03:27:17.060 --> 03:27:25.180]   "I'm going after Gondal and Jael."
[03:27:25.180 --> 03:27:26.180]   Chapter Fifteen
[03:27:26.180 --> 03:27:27.180]   "Veridis."
[03:27:27.180 --> 03:27:35.300]   "Shield wall," Veridis shouted, lifting his borrowed shield and expecting those either
[03:27:35.300 --> 03:27:37.980]   side of him to lock into place.
[03:27:37.980 --> 03:27:42.300]   There was a sporadic thudding as shields came up, lacking the controlled discipline that
[03:27:42.300 --> 03:27:43.780]   he was used to.
[03:27:43.780 --> 03:27:50.260]   "These men are not my drake's teeth, not veterans of a score of battles in the shield wall."
[03:27:50.260 --> 03:27:51.260]   He bit back a curse.
[03:27:51.260 --> 03:27:55.040]   "I am lucky they are here at all."
[03:27:55.040 --> 03:27:58.980]   When Veridis had spoken of using the shield wall to clear the road, Krellis had curled
[03:27:58.980 --> 03:28:01.580]   a lip in disgust.
[03:28:01.580 --> 03:28:04.740]   Veridis's brother had never liked the idea of men fighting in such a way.
[03:28:04.740 --> 03:28:07.620]   To him it lacked honour.
[03:28:07.620 --> 03:28:10.860]   It works and it will save lives.
[03:28:10.860 --> 03:28:15.380]   Even as Veridis had said the words, he'd heard an affair's voice echoing them in his mind.
[03:28:15.380 --> 03:28:21.740]   "Your task is to keep the road clear and then to hold it," Albin had said, stepping in between
[03:28:21.740 --> 03:28:22.740]   the two brothers.
[03:28:22.740 --> 03:28:25.940]   "Now how you do it is your decision, Veridis.
[03:28:25.940 --> 03:28:30.300]   Only guard our backs and stop the reinforcements that will surely come from further along the
[03:28:30.300 --> 03:28:32.720]   road."
[03:28:32.720 --> 03:28:35.580]   Krellis had said no more, and so the plan had proceeded.
[03:28:35.580 --> 03:28:39.140]   Veridis attacking the road from the north, Albin and McKeen spearheading two smaller
[03:28:39.140 --> 03:28:43.940]   groups into the camp, Veridis and his reserve group holding the road as Krellis moved onto
[03:28:43.940 --> 03:28:49.980]   the main camp and guarding against the counter-attack that would inevitably come.
[03:28:49.980 --> 03:28:53.500]   So far, it had all gone remarkably smoothly.
[03:28:53.500 --> 03:28:57.620]   The enemy, breaking and scattering, surprise and ferocity shattering any resistance before
[03:28:57.620 --> 03:29:01.080]   it had a chance to form fully.
[03:29:01.080 --> 03:29:07.060]   It's amazing what a small and focused force can do against a larger unprepared one.
[03:29:07.060 --> 03:29:12.180]   He took a deep breath, knew that battle was close, tried to calm the anger he felt bubbling
[03:29:12.180 --> 03:29:14.940]   away inside his chest.
[03:29:14.940 --> 03:29:18.580]   That was his overwhelming emotion right now, anger.
[03:29:18.580 --> 03:29:23.180]   He was angry with Krellis, for the web of lies and deception he had woven, and for what
[03:29:23.180 --> 03:29:28.540]   he had done to Nefaire, but that was nothing besides the anger he felt for his old friend.
[03:29:28.540 --> 03:29:31.860]   Nefaire, how could you believe Khaledos?
[03:29:31.860 --> 03:29:34.880]   Why did you not resist or come to me sooner?
[03:29:34.880 --> 03:29:38.420]   We could have stood against Khaledos together.
[03:29:38.420 --> 03:29:42.060]   And most of all, he was angry with himself.
[03:29:42.060 --> 03:29:43.940]   I am a fool.
[03:29:43.940 --> 03:29:49.380]   How did I not see it all happening about me, Veridis the loyal, Veridis the trustworthy,
[03:29:49.380 --> 03:29:52.980]   Veridis the blind idiot, I say.
[03:29:52.980 --> 03:29:54.020]   Calm yourself.
[03:29:54.020 --> 03:29:55.020]   Focus.
[03:29:55.020 --> 03:29:57.520]   You have a battle to fight.
[03:29:57.520 --> 03:30:01.660]   He had gathered his two hundred on the embankment to the north-east of the camp, at the point
[03:30:01.660 --> 03:30:06.300]   where the road left the camp behind and ploughed into the forest.
[03:30:06.300 --> 03:30:10.860]   From this vantage point, Veridis had watched Krellis, Albin and McKean flood through the
[03:30:10.860 --> 03:30:14.020]   camp with their small bands of men.
[03:30:14.020 --> 03:30:19.020]   Fires and great ploughs of smoke marked their paths as they moved ever deeper, inexorably
[03:30:19.020 --> 03:30:21.940]   towards the hill with Gundl's command tent on it.
[03:30:21.940 --> 03:30:26.900]   He'd seen movement on the hill, what looked like combat, though it was hard to discern
[03:30:26.900 --> 03:30:29.380]   any details because of the distance.
[03:30:29.380 --> 03:30:34.440]   Now, the flames and smoke were so dense that it was hard to see anything at all, but Veridis'
[03:30:34.440 --> 03:30:38.020]   attention was needed elsewhere anyway.
[03:30:38.020 --> 03:30:43.540]   To his left, in a depth of fawn, men were approaching along the road.
[03:30:43.540 --> 03:30:47.060]   Veridis saw a knot of warriors in mail and leather at the front and centre of a much
[03:30:47.060 --> 03:30:53.220]   larger horde that spilt down the embankments to either side, at least a thousand strong.
[03:30:53.220 --> 03:30:58.360]   Finally, the shields either side of Veridis locked into his.
[03:30:58.360 --> 03:31:02.860]   He felt the urge to order the march, knew that the shield wall moving towards a larger
[03:31:02.860 --> 03:31:08.140]   foe had always caused hesitation and sown seeds of fear in the enemy, but he was uncertain
[03:31:08.140 --> 03:31:10.460]   of the men about him.
[03:31:10.460 --> 03:31:15.220]   Just getting into formation on the road and forming the shield wall seemed to tax them.
[03:31:15.220 --> 03:31:19.980]   He glanced at the warriors who was right, a young man, his beard a straggly thing.
[03:31:19.980 --> 03:31:22.900]   "Young, I know him.
[03:31:22.900 --> 03:31:25.060]   It is Balan.
[03:31:25.060 --> 03:31:27.220]   He is only a few years younger than I.
[03:31:27.220 --> 03:31:29.600]   We used to spar together."
[03:31:29.600 --> 03:31:33.740]   But Veridis felt older than his years, knew that his travels and experience in the shield
[03:31:33.740 --> 03:31:36.380]   wall set him apart from most of those about him.
[03:31:36.380 --> 03:31:39.220]   "I can't expect too much from them yet.
[03:31:39.220 --> 03:31:42.860]   They only know this much because an affair ordered that all men of Tenebrau were drilled
[03:31:42.860 --> 03:31:43.860]   in the shield wall."
[03:31:43.860 --> 03:31:50.340]   "It will have to do," Veridis thought. "Marching may be a step too far.
[03:31:50.340 --> 03:31:51.620]   We'll wait here for them.
[03:31:51.620 --> 03:31:56.060]   We fill the road and block the path to the camp so they'll have to cut us down and march
[03:31:56.060 --> 03:31:59.620]   through us to get at Krellaty's flank."
[03:31:59.620 --> 03:32:04.380]   Looking at the men around him, earnest, brave men a thousand leaks from home, he felt some
[03:32:04.380 --> 03:32:09.740]   of his anger drain, replaced with sympathy and a deep sense of responsibility for them.
[03:32:09.740 --> 03:32:15.100]   "Balan, listen to me," Veridis said to the warrior beside him.
[03:32:15.100 --> 03:32:18.660]   The man returned his gaze and Veridis saw fear in his eyes.
[03:32:18.660 --> 03:32:23.380]   "Follow my orders and we'll come through this."
[03:32:23.380 --> 03:32:26.940]   The warrior nodded at him, then looked away.
[03:32:26.940 --> 03:32:29.940]   Shouts and challenges grew louder as the enemy came closer.
[03:32:29.940 --> 03:32:37.080]   "If they get past us, our kin and sword brothers die," Veridis yelled, feeling the blood begin
[03:32:37.080 --> 03:32:41.780]   to surge through his veins, fear and excitement merging into the exhilaration that he always
[03:32:41.780 --> 03:32:42.980]   felt before battle.
[03:32:42.980 --> 03:32:48.460]   "Remember your oaths and fight for your sword brother beside you."
[03:32:48.460 --> 03:32:52.140]   He felt Balan stand straighter alongside him.
[03:32:52.140 --> 03:32:56.860]   They were inexperienced, but to the warband of Gundl that was approaching him, the shield
[03:32:56.860 --> 03:33:01.140]   wall was like nothing they had ever seen before.
[03:33:01.140 --> 03:33:05.980]   Veridis saw the front ranks of the enemy slow, close enough now to see looks of confusion
[03:33:05.980 --> 03:33:09.260]   and worry upon their faces.
[03:33:09.260 --> 03:33:12.180]   Warriors were a superstitious bunch, always wary of the unknown.
[03:33:12.180 --> 03:33:18.420]   "Swords," Veridis shouted, drawing a short blade at his hip.
[03:33:18.420 --> 03:33:23.020]   About and behind him he heard the hiss of iron leaving leather.
[03:33:23.020 --> 03:33:27.040]   He began to thump his hilt upon the wooden boards of his shield, the rhythmic pounding
[03:33:27.040 --> 03:33:31.820]   taken up first by those about him, then spreading, rippling through the deep wall of two hundred
[03:33:31.820 --> 03:33:33.860]   men.
[03:33:33.860 --> 03:33:38.820]   He saw its effect upon those approaching, warriors hesitating in their steps, uncertainties
[03:33:38.820 --> 03:33:41.860]   spreading like a mist.
[03:33:41.860 --> 03:33:46.300]   Then one warrior stepped from the crowd, a big man clad in mail, a helm of iron, his
[03:33:46.300 --> 03:33:48.620]   sword raised high.
[03:33:48.620 --> 03:33:52.780]   He bellowed a wordless challenge and ran at Veridis's wall of shields.
[03:33:52.780 --> 03:33:57.900]   A trickle of men followed him, warriors from the centre, then others, warriors, woodsmen
[03:33:57.900 --> 03:34:02.020]   and labourers from the flanks, all screaming blood and murder.
[03:34:02.020 --> 03:34:08.180]   "Ready!" Veridis roared, spreading his feet and leaning forwards into his shield.
[03:34:08.180 --> 03:34:12.860]   A thread of fear clenched in his belly as it always did in this moment when battle was
[03:34:12.860 --> 03:34:16.220]   inevitable but not yet joined.
[03:34:16.220 --> 03:34:21.780]   Then men were crashing into his shield, blows raining upon it, shuddering through his wrist
[03:34:21.780 --> 03:34:28.260]   and arm into his shoulder, numbing muscle and sinew, and the fear was gone.
[03:34:28.260 --> 03:34:31.780]   A face appeared above his shield rim, snarling at him.
[03:34:31.780 --> 03:34:36.820]   "Now!" Veridis bellowed, stabbing his short sword through the thin gap between his shield
[03:34:36.820 --> 03:34:37.980]   and balance.
[03:34:37.980 --> 03:34:41.900]   To either side, warriors doing the same.
[03:34:41.900 --> 03:34:47.420]   He felt his blade bite into flesh, drew it back red, stabbed again.
[03:34:47.420 --> 03:34:50.740]   The face above his shield rim disappeared, replaced by another.
[03:34:50.740 --> 03:34:56.580]   He stabbed again, felt his blade turn on mail, drew it back and stabbed lower, heard a scream,
[03:34:56.580 --> 03:35:01.540]   kept stabbing, not frantically as Balan was doing beside him, but steady, a rhythm to
[03:35:01.540 --> 03:35:02.540]   it.
[03:35:02.540 --> 03:35:05.060]   "Easy!" Veridis barked at Balan.
[03:35:05.060 --> 03:35:08.380]   "They're not going anywhere!"
[03:35:08.380 --> 03:35:15.300]   Balan shot to a glance, eyes wide and white, but his blade work became less frantic.
[03:35:15.300 --> 03:35:21.380]   Men fell, blood sluicing down Veridis' blade, soaking his hand, muscles burning, the unrelenting
[03:35:21.380 --> 03:35:26.500]   thud of blows against his shield, pushing his straining body to its limits.
[03:35:26.500 --> 03:35:31.460]   Men use screamed against the constant pressure as men piled against the shield wall, some
[03:35:31.460 --> 03:35:35.900]   throwing themselves, others crushed by the oncoming mass behind them like the sea against
[03:35:35.900 --> 03:35:39.060]   a tidal wall.
[03:35:39.060 --> 03:35:43.980]   Fingers grabbed at the rim of Veridis' shield, pulling it down, and Veridis saw a woodsman,
[03:35:43.980 --> 03:35:47.500]   caught a glimpse of the road and forest behind him.
[03:35:47.500 --> 03:35:52.300]   Veridis chopped, another scream as fingers flew through the air.
[03:35:52.300 --> 03:35:57.740]   The constant pressure was easing, still the thud of weapons as men hammered at the wall,
[03:35:57.740 --> 03:36:01.820]   but the unrelenting press of bodies was gone.
[03:36:01.820 --> 03:36:06.260]   The end is coming, Veridis recognised, when the initial rush of that first battle fury
[03:36:06.260 --> 03:36:10.580]   was spent and men looked about at the carnage reaped by the shield wall.
[03:36:10.580 --> 03:36:17.100]   He had seen it before, knew that the ground would be piled with the dead, warrior spirits
[03:36:17.100 --> 03:36:21.260]   crushed by the shield wall's faceless brutality.
[03:36:21.260 --> 03:36:24.460]   We must strike now and break them.
[03:36:24.460 --> 03:36:27.820]   "Forwards," Veridis cried.
[03:36:27.820 --> 03:36:33.740]   He punched Balan to his right to get his attention, yelled his command again and took a step forwards.
[03:36:33.740 --> 03:36:39.180]   For a moment he thought he was alone, stepping out of the wall into certain death, but then
[03:36:39.180 --> 03:36:43.900]   Balan followed him, a heartbeat later the man on his either side doing the same and
[03:36:43.900 --> 03:36:50.220]   with a stutter the front row of the shield wall took one shambling step forwards.
[03:36:50.220 --> 03:36:54.380]   Veridis stumbled on a body underfoot but managed to stay upright, even though the ground was
[03:36:54.380 --> 03:36:58.220]   slick with blood and snared with limbs.
[03:36:58.220 --> 03:37:03.460]   He felt the line sway, thought that the wall would splinter, break and be scattered but
[03:37:03.460 --> 03:37:06.460]   then it steadied.
[03:37:06.460 --> 03:37:10.800]   Veridis felt the strength and solidity return.
[03:37:10.800 --> 03:37:15.380]   He set his feet and stabbed through the gap in the shields, felt his sword pierce flesh,
[03:37:15.380 --> 03:37:17.940]   heard more screams as others did the same.
[03:37:17.940 --> 03:37:20.340]   "It's working.
[03:37:20.340 --> 03:37:21.340]   Forwards!"
[03:37:21.340 --> 03:37:22.340]   Veridis yelled again.
[03:37:22.340 --> 03:37:24.260]   I did not wait this time to take another step.
[03:37:24.260 --> 03:37:26.780]   The shield wall shuddered forwards.
[03:37:26.780 --> 03:37:30.460]   Swords snaked out, more men falling, dying.
[03:37:30.460 --> 03:37:31.980]   "March!"
[03:37:31.980 --> 03:37:36.020]   Veridis shouted, his voice hoarse and dry.
[03:37:36.020 --> 03:37:39.820]   Bagging his sword against his shield to set time, he felt the whole shield wall move with
[03:37:39.820 --> 03:37:44.180]   him, some of the men behind him thudding their swords against shields in time with him, the
[03:37:44.180 --> 03:37:47.780]   front row still stabbing as they marched.
[03:37:47.780 --> 03:37:52.060]   They were a ragged mass compared to the disciplined ranks that Veridis was accustomed to leading
[03:37:52.060 --> 03:37:57.120]   but still he grinned with the joy of it as his enemy fell before him, felt as if they
[03:37:57.120 --> 03:38:03.300]   were unbeatable, unstoppable and then the pressure before them was gone, the sound of
[03:38:03.300 --> 03:38:08.540]   feet drumming on the road as men turned and ran before them.
[03:38:08.540 --> 03:38:10.380]   Veridis called a halt.
[03:38:10.380 --> 03:38:15.920]   The wall stumbled to a ragged stop and Veridis lowered his shield.
[03:38:15.920 --> 03:38:19.180]   Trees lay strewn everywhere.
[03:38:19.180 --> 03:38:23.980]   Trees loomed before them, the camp ablaze behind.
[03:38:23.980 --> 03:38:27.580]   Dim figures could be seen fleeing along the road, some escaping into the gloom of the
[03:38:27.580 --> 03:38:30.140]   forest to either side of the road.
[03:38:30.140 --> 03:38:33.140]   Not enough to challenge us again.
[03:38:33.140 --> 03:38:35.900]   Relief flooded through him.
[03:38:35.900 --> 03:38:37.940]   They are broken.
[03:38:37.940 --> 03:38:40.220]   With one.
[03:38:40.220 --> 03:38:43.620]   They had all known that the greatest threat would come from the warriors and workers who
[03:38:43.620 --> 03:38:47.140]   were away from the camp, spread along the road.
[03:38:47.140 --> 03:38:50.540]   They were the ones who would be alerted to the attack, would be able to gather their
[03:38:50.540 --> 03:38:56.700]   courage and attack unlike all those within the camp who would be caught by surprise.
[03:38:56.700 --> 03:38:59.580]   He looked and saw Bannon grinning.
[03:38:59.580 --> 03:39:04.460]   The recognition of survival, the joy of victory saw the same expression spreading amongst
[03:39:04.460 --> 03:39:07.020]   those about him.
[03:39:07.020 --> 03:39:10.060]   Then voices yelled a warning.
[03:39:10.060 --> 03:39:12.700]   Death screams rang out.
[03:39:12.700 --> 03:39:14.900]   Veridis spun around searching for the new danger.
[03:39:14.900 --> 03:39:17.140]   It came from behind.
[03:39:17.140 --> 03:39:21.460]   Figures were emerging from the camp, a solid mass of warriors appearing dressed in blackmail,
[03:39:21.460 --> 03:39:24.380]   curved swords in their hands.
[03:39:24.380 --> 03:39:26.620]   Kaddishim.
[03:39:26.620 --> 03:39:30.120]   They were running up the embankment, carving into the flank and rear of their edited shield
[03:39:30.120 --> 03:39:31.120]   wall.
[03:39:31.120 --> 03:39:35.300]   Twenty, forty, sixty of them, more appearing from amongst the tents as well as a tight
[03:39:35.300 --> 03:39:37.860]   knot of others behind them.
[03:39:37.860 --> 03:39:40.800]   Gundl and his honor guard.
[03:39:40.800 --> 03:39:43.500]   He cannot get away.
[03:39:43.500 --> 03:39:46.000]   Veridis began moving towards the Kaddishim.
[03:39:46.000 --> 03:39:50.220]   Even as his mouth opened to shout for the wall to reform, he knew it would not defeat
[03:39:50.220 --> 03:39:52.900]   these demons spawn.
[03:39:52.900 --> 03:39:58.500]   We have to take their heads and the war will not help us do that.
[03:39:58.500 --> 03:40:02.640]   He saw men crunching shields together, falling back on the strategy that had just served
[03:40:02.640 --> 03:40:07.460]   them so well, but a handful of Kaddishim leapt at the hastily formed wall, ripped it apart
[03:40:07.460 --> 03:40:11.700]   with savage fury, swords rising and falling and deadly arcs.
[03:40:11.700 --> 03:40:13.220]   My men are dying.
[03:40:13.220 --> 03:40:15.680]   The Kaddishim are slaughtering my men.
[03:40:15.680 --> 03:40:23.900]   Veridis broke into a run and hurled himself at the Kaddishim.
[03:40:23.900 --> 03:40:25.980]   Chapter 16
[03:40:25.980 --> 03:40:28.980]   JL
[03:40:28.980 --> 03:40:34.020]   JL ran through the camp with every jarring step, every wheezing breath, trying to somehow
[03:40:34.020 --> 03:40:38.580]   lessen the pain of his broken ribs, though that doesn't seem to be working.
[03:40:38.580 --> 03:40:42.340]   Blood was still leaking into his eyes from a wound on his forehead and McKean's sword
[03:40:42.340 --> 03:40:47.100]   cut on his leg and forearm burned as if he'd been branded.
[03:40:47.100 --> 03:40:50.960]   He took me by surprise, before I was ready.
[03:40:50.960 --> 03:40:54.980]   He risked a look over his shoulder, relieved to see that there was no lunatic armed to
[03:40:54.980 --> 03:41:01.660]   the brim with knives chasing after him, in fact, no one was in sight before or behind.
[03:41:01.660 --> 03:41:07.100]   It felt as if he was alone in a world of white tents and narrow aisles, of smoke and fire
[03:41:07.100 --> 03:41:10.020]   and distant screams.
[03:41:10.020 --> 03:41:14.180]   The last he'd seen of McKean had been rolling in the dirt with Dag.
[03:41:14.180 --> 03:41:18.660]   He looked like a man with a serious grudge and I really could do without that right now.
[03:41:18.660 --> 03:41:22.940]   Could be that Dag has killed McKean.
[03:41:22.940 --> 03:41:25.460]   Much as he wanted to believe it, he wasn't convinced.
[03:41:25.460 --> 03:41:28.540]   The ease with which McKean had shattered his ribs had shocked JL.
[03:41:28.540 --> 03:41:31.780]   "How did he move so fast?"
[03:41:31.780 --> 03:41:33.860]   "It must have been a lucky blow.
[03:41:33.860 --> 03:41:36.280]   He's old and broken."
[03:41:36.280 --> 03:41:40.780]   He heard screaming off to his left and so veered right, taking a new path through abandoned
[03:41:40.780 --> 03:41:43.200]   tents and cook fires.
[03:41:43.200 --> 03:41:46.500]   No more battle if I can help it.
[03:41:46.500 --> 03:41:51.140]   Ahead of him, the trees of fawn loomed, overlooking the fringes of the camp like a tribe of dour
[03:41:51.140 --> 03:41:53.640]   ogres.
[03:41:53.640 --> 03:41:57.100]   Nearly out of this hellhole, even if McKean still breathes, he'll never find me now.
[03:41:57.100 --> 03:42:02.700]   I just have to find my men, three hundred swords waiting for me half a league along
[03:42:02.700 --> 03:42:06.340]   Gundl's cursed road.
[03:42:06.340 --> 03:42:09.860]   McLamour of battle drifted down to JL.
[03:42:09.860 --> 03:42:12.140]   He was travelling straight towards it.
[03:42:12.140 --> 03:42:17.060]   He didn't turn away this time, though, as it was exactly where he needed to go.
[03:42:17.060 --> 03:42:21.740]   My men are out there somewhere and if I'm going to get out of fawn alive, I will need
[03:42:21.740 --> 03:42:24.080]   them about me.
[03:42:24.080 --> 03:42:28.020]   So JL gritted his teeth and ran on.
[03:42:28.020 --> 03:42:32.600]   He emerged from the tent into a scene of carnage.
[03:42:32.600 --> 03:42:37.020]   Warriors were masked upon the road, more of the enemy in the black and silver of Tenebrel,
[03:42:37.020 --> 03:42:41.940]   but to JL's pleasant surprise, the Ge'har were loose amongst them.
[03:42:41.940 --> 03:42:46.620]   The road was a heaving mass of battle, the path into the forest blocked for the moment,
[03:42:46.620 --> 03:42:50.500]   but the Ge'har were doing all that they could about that.
[03:42:50.500 --> 03:42:54.980]   Then as JL watched, he saw one of the Ge'har lift a warrior into the air and a hurl him
[03:42:54.980 --> 03:42:56.460]   down the embankment.
[03:42:56.460 --> 03:43:01.580]   He might be able to sneak through in the chaos, he thought, and began to climb.
[03:43:01.580 --> 03:43:03.840]   Then he saw Gundl.
[03:43:03.840 --> 03:43:08.100]   The young king of Carnotan was standing upon the road, separate from the battle.
[03:43:08.100 --> 03:43:12.800]   His sycophants huddled about him, though their numbers looked somewhat thinned.
[03:43:12.800 --> 03:43:16.700]   About them were a dozen or so Ge'har warriors, the rest of Gundl's honor guard trying to
[03:43:16.700 --> 03:43:22.060]   carve away through the wall of flesh and bone that barred the way to escape.
[03:43:22.060 --> 03:43:26.260]   From what JL could see, they were doing a good job of it.
[03:43:26.260 --> 03:43:30.300]   Stick with Gundl, or try and sneak past.
[03:43:30.300 --> 03:43:35.540]   A warrior in black and silver flew through the air, a hand span from JL, struck the ground
[03:43:35.540 --> 03:43:39.860]   and rolled bonelessly down the embankment, crashing into a tent and bringing it down
[03:43:39.860 --> 03:43:41.300]   around him.
[03:43:41.300 --> 03:43:46.060]   JL reached the road and tried to skirt the combat, which had broken down into a series
[03:43:46.060 --> 03:43:49.580]   of scattered and brutal skirmishes.
[03:43:49.580 --> 03:43:55.020]   The enemy looked to be rallying against the Ge'har, one man leading a charge that sent
[03:43:55.020 --> 03:43:58.380]   two of those disturbing black mists jetting into the air.
[03:43:58.380 --> 03:44:03.660]   "Break, damn you," JL muttered at the enemy, "Don't rally."
[03:44:03.660 --> 03:44:11.060]   "JL," a voice called, and for a terrifying moment, JL thought it was McKean.
[03:44:11.060 --> 03:44:16.140]   His head jerked around to see Gundl waving wildly to him from the midst of his protectors.
[03:44:16.140 --> 03:44:19.700]   "Over here," Gundl beckoned to him.
[03:44:19.700 --> 03:44:23.380]   For a moment, JL considered his options and quickly concluded that he was safer within
[03:44:23.380 --> 03:44:26.740]   a ring of Ge'har warriors.
[03:44:26.740 --> 03:44:30.620]   He hobbled over to Gundl and JL stepped out of the way to let him through.
[03:44:30.620 --> 03:44:33.860]   "I'm glad you're still alive," Gundl said.
[03:44:33.860 --> 03:44:35.820]   "Three hundred men, you say.
[03:44:35.820 --> 03:44:37.820]   Where are they?"
[03:44:37.820 --> 03:44:40.940]   For a moment, JL didn't understand what Gundl was talking about.
[03:44:40.940 --> 03:44:46.260]   Then he realized he was referring to JL's men, left waiting further along the road.
[03:44:46.260 --> 03:44:48.260]   Not a complete idiot, then.
[03:44:48.260 --> 03:44:54.020]   "That way," JL pointed over the combat before them into the dark tunnel of the road.
[03:44:54.020 --> 03:44:55.020]   "Good.
[03:44:55.020 --> 03:45:01.820]   Drasil is that way, too, and a few hundred more swords around me would be a good thing."
[03:45:01.820 --> 03:45:05.980]   He looked back at his camp, at the flames and the black clouds of smoke, at the dead
[03:45:05.980 --> 03:45:07.580]   scattered all around.
[03:45:07.580 --> 03:45:12.400]   "Look what they've done," Gundl wailed, face twisting in misery.
[03:45:12.400 --> 03:45:15.260]   "They've destroyed my camp, crushed my warband."
[03:45:15.260 --> 03:45:20.380]   "Most hope they don't do it to you, too, you whining little worm, and more importantly,
[03:45:20.380 --> 03:45:21.380]   not to me."
[03:45:21.380 --> 03:45:27.700]   "We need to move," JL muttered, not liking the feeling of standing still.
[03:45:27.700 --> 03:45:31.700]   The knowledge that McKean was out there somewhere, hunting him, hovered at the back of his mind
[03:45:31.700 --> 03:45:33.140]   like a black cloud.
[03:45:33.140 --> 03:45:34.140]   "Yes.
[03:45:34.140 --> 03:45:35.300]   Onwards!"
[03:45:35.300 --> 03:45:37.740]   Gundl yelled.
[03:45:37.740 --> 03:45:42.080]   A Jihar warrior turned its black eyes upon Gundl, then with a shrug, began to lead their
[03:45:42.080 --> 03:45:45.380]   small group along the road.
[03:45:45.380 --> 03:45:50.620]   The other Jihar, a dozen left with Gundl at best, fanned out in a tight half-circle, pushing
[03:45:50.620 --> 03:45:53.220]   into the fringes of battle.
[03:45:53.220 --> 03:45:58.580]   Then something crashed into their group from the left, sending men tumbling, Jihar reeling,
[03:45:58.580 --> 03:46:01.340]   turning to face this new attack.
[03:46:01.340 --> 03:46:04.980]   JL staggered into one of Gundl's followers, shoving the man to the ground as he righted
[03:46:04.980 --> 03:46:05.980]   himself.
[03:46:05.980 --> 03:46:10.860]   They'd been attacked by a knot of warriors in black and silver, charged and rammed by
[03:46:10.860 --> 03:46:14.420]   them all with shields raised and interlocked.
[03:46:14.420 --> 03:46:18.980]   Even as he looked, short swords darted out from the small wall of shields.
[03:46:18.980 --> 03:46:23.500]   Two of Gundl's followers were caught in the attack and fell, pierced many times.
[03:46:23.500 --> 03:46:27.920]   Gundl was shrieking, waving his sword around ineffectually.
[03:46:27.920 --> 03:46:32.220]   JL saw blades sink into the flesh of a Jihar, but it shrugged off the blows and grabbed
[03:46:32.220 --> 03:46:37.180]   a shield rim, dragging the warrior behind it forwards and chopping into his neck, sending
[03:46:37.180 --> 03:46:41.220]   him crashing to the ground in a spray of blood.
[03:46:41.220 --> 03:46:46.940]   The small shield wall fractured, men breaking away and attacking Gundl's party the old way,
[03:46:46.940 --> 03:46:49.300]   man to man.
[03:46:49.300 --> 03:46:51.860]   Not a wise choice against the Jihar.
[03:46:51.860 --> 03:46:57.620]   JL backed away, put a few of Gundl's followers between him and this new attack.
[03:46:57.620 --> 03:47:00.940]   I'm scared of no man but...
[03:47:00.940 --> 03:47:06.800]   He put a hand to his throbbing ribs, glanced down at the blood, crusting his thigh.
[03:47:06.800 --> 03:47:09.100]   Another warrior came at the first Jihar.
[03:47:09.100 --> 03:47:13.700]   This man in a black and silver commander's cuirass, using sword and shield together to
[03:47:13.700 --> 03:47:18.860]   push the creature back apace, sword darting out to stab at its thigh, shield boss punching
[03:47:18.860 --> 03:47:21.340]   into the Jihar's face.
[03:47:21.340 --> 03:47:24.540]   There was something familiar about the warrior.
[03:47:24.540 --> 03:47:27.300]   I know him.
[03:47:27.300 --> 03:47:32.900]   The Jihar staggered back a few steps, black blood dripping from its broken nose.
[03:47:32.900 --> 03:47:38.580]   Its face twisted in a snarl as it launched itself forwards, shoulder ramming into the
[03:47:38.580 --> 03:47:43.600]   warrior, sending him stumbling backwards, tripping over a corpse and falling hard.
[03:47:43.600 --> 03:47:49.020]   The Jihar stood over him, curved sword rising, then another figure was there, plunging a
[03:47:49.020 --> 03:47:52.540]   spear into the Jihar's throat.
[03:47:52.540 --> 03:47:54.820]   A woman.
[03:47:54.820 --> 03:48:01.140]   She was dressed in travelling fur and leather, richly made, dark hair pulled back tight.
[03:48:01.140 --> 03:48:05.140]   Then warriors were swarming either side of her, chopping at the wounded Jihar as she
[03:48:05.140 --> 03:48:08.300]   wrenched her spear free.
[03:48:08.300 --> 03:48:13.160]   The Jihar warrior went down in a hail of blows, its head hacked from its body, that black
[03:48:13.160 --> 03:48:15.780]   mist spilling from its neck.
[03:48:15.780 --> 03:48:20.340]   A figure formed in the air, black winged and red-eyed, hissing its fury.
[03:48:20.340 --> 03:48:24.560]   Then it was gone, only a few ragged wisps remaining.
[03:48:24.560 --> 03:48:28.180]   I wish they'd stop doing that.
[03:48:28.180 --> 03:48:31.700]   Gundal was screaming orders to attack, though nobody seemed to be paying much attention to
[03:48:31.700 --> 03:48:33.100]   him.
[03:48:33.100 --> 03:48:36.180]   Most of his hangars on were running in different directions.
[03:48:36.180 --> 03:48:40.100]   Jaiel saw one of the Jihar grab Gundal by the scruff of his neck and start dragging him
[03:48:40.100 --> 03:48:45.940]   through the crowd, three or four Jihar carving away for him through the melee.
[03:48:45.940 --> 03:48:50.460]   Gundal spluttered a protest, but the Jihar just marched resolutely on.
[03:48:50.460 --> 03:48:55.700]   Jaiel lurched into motion, saw them as his best way of getting out of this and stumbled
[03:48:55.700 --> 03:48:57.500]   close behind them.
[03:48:57.500 --> 03:49:04.660]   A huddle of warriors crashed into them, mostly enemy all striking at a Jihar in their midst.
[03:49:04.660 --> 03:49:10.380]   With a grimace, Jaiel drew his sword and pulled a knife from his belt.
[03:49:10.380 --> 03:49:14.060]   Pain over death always the better option.
[03:49:14.060 --> 03:49:20.620]   He hacked at a warrior's head, bursts of agony pulsing from his damaged ribs.
[03:49:20.620 --> 03:49:25.940]   He dented the man's helm, then slashed at another with his knife leaving a long red wound, this
[03:49:25.940 --> 03:49:27.740]   warrior lurching away.
[03:49:27.740 --> 03:49:32.860]   Then they were past them, Jaiel adding his blades to the Jihar as they cut, hewed, punched
[03:49:32.860 --> 03:49:37.100]   and stabbed their way through the battling mass.
[03:49:37.100 --> 03:49:41.900]   After his left, Jaiel saw the woman still wielding her spear, a group of warriors tight
[03:49:41.900 --> 03:49:42.900]   about her.
[03:49:42.900 --> 03:49:48.620]   He had seen her before, at the great council of Aquillus and Gerilyn.
[03:49:48.620 --> 03:49:52.340]   He blinked as recognition dawned.
[03:49:52.340 --> 03:49:54.340]   "Fidelae."
[03:49:54.340 --> 03:49:58.220]   Aquillus's wife, or widow, now, an affair's mother.
[03:49:58.220 --> 03:50:00.860]   "What is she doing here?
[03:50:00.860 --> 03:50:04.580]   And fighting against an affair's ally?"
[03:50:04.580 --> 03:50:09.540]   He grunted, as he ducked a sword blow aimed at his head, chopped at an ankle, then glanced
[03:50:09.540 --> 03:50:11.020]   back to Fidelae.
[03:50:11.020 --> 03:50:16.180]   She'd make a good hostage, either to buy me safe passage out of here or a good trophy
[03:50:16.180 --> 03:50:20.180]   to present an affair, something to win back some favour and prestige from the disastrous
[03:50:20.180 --> 03:50:23.400]   mess this campaign has become.
[03:50:23.400 --> 03:50:26.660]   They were almost through the main press of battle now.
[03:50:26.660 --> 03:50:32.660]   Jaiel could see empty road beyond a few clumps of combat, the darkness of fawn beckoning,
[03:50:32.660 --> 03:50:35.460]   promising safety.
[03:50:35.460 --> 03:50:38.720]   Battle cries snapped his attention back.
[03:50:38.720 --> 03:50:42.180]   Behind him, one of the jihar fell to its knee.
[03:50:42.180 --> 03:50:47.140]   It struggled to rise but another warrior lunged in close and his sword swing took the jihar's
[03:50:47.140 --> 03:50:51.140]   head, black vapour spewed from the wound.
[03:50:51.140 --> 03:50:55.820]   The jihar that had been dragging Gundl let go of him to join the fray, sword rising and
[03:50:55.820 --> 03:51:02.140]   falling, a warrior staggering away with a terrible gash from his forehead to his chin.
[03:51:02.140 --> 03:51:05.900]   Gundl slipped and fell to the ground beside Jaiel and grabbed at his boot.
[03:51:05.900 --> 03:51:12.580]   "Help me!" Gundl cried, trying to climb up Jaiel's leg and pull himself back to his feet.
[03:51:12.580 --> 03:51:16.940]   Jaiel sneered down at him, remembering how Gundl had mocked him back in his tent.
[03:51:16.940 --> 03:51:21.860]   "I don't need you or your horses now."
[03:51:21.860 --> 03:51:26.780]   He pulled his sword back and stabbed it into Gundl's screaming mouth, smashing teeth on
[03:51:26.780 --> 03:51:31.460]   into the soft tissue of his throat, jerked it out red, left the king of Carnatan bleeding
[03:51:31.460 --> 03:51:35.660]   out his life in the dirt of fawn.
[03:51:35.660 --> 03:51:40.340]   Looking up again, he saw that the last few moments of frantic combat had swung them close
[03:51:40.340 --> 03:51:43.180]   to the woman he was sure was Fidele.
[03:51:43.180 --> 03:51:48.500]   At last, fate smiles upon me once more.
[03:51:48.500 --> 03:51:56.900]   He swerved around a mass of combat and strode straight towards her.
[03:51:56.900 --> 03:52:02.540]   Chapter 17 Makiin
[03:52:02.540 --> 03:52:06.140]   Makiin burst out from the rows of tents onto the embankment.
[03:52:06.140 --> 03:52:09.420]   The tangled snare of fawn forest loomed close by.
[03:52:09.420 --> 03:52:15.820]   At the top of the embankment, Gundl's new road carved a line into the trees.
[03:52:15.820 --> 03:52:20.300]   Figures fought upon it, the clamour and stench of combat drifting down to Makiin.
[03:52:20.300 --> 03:52:22.820]   "Where is he?
[03:52:22.820 --> 03:52:25.300]   Where's Jaiel?"
[03:52:25.300 --> 03:52:30.620]   As he had run through the fractured camp, memory upon memory had flooded Makiin's mind.
[03:52:30.620 --> 03:52:36.820]   Her lifetime has served as Castel's oath-sworn shieldman of friendship, loyalty and love.
[03:52:36.820 --> 03:52:40.580]   And finally, one memory overwhelming all of the others.
[03:52:40.580 --> 03:52:46.840]   Of Jaiel plunging a sword into Castel's belly, those few heartbeats replayed in his mind
[03:52:46.840 --> 03:52:52.180]   time and time again until his whole world was a place of heartbreak and rage.
[03:52:52.180 --> 03:52:55.220]   "Where is he?"
[03:52:55.220 --> 03:52:56.220]   He came this way.
[03:52:56.220 --> 03:52:57.220]   I know it.
[03:52:57.220 --> 03:53:03.540]   Makiin had lived in fawn with the Gadre and learned the way of wood and forest.
[03:53:03.540 --> 03:53:06.220]   Not that Jaiel was hard to track.
[03:53:06.220 --> 03:53:09.220]   He'd left a trail of his own blood for Makiin to follow.
[03:53:09.220 --> 03:53:12.540]   But where now?
[03:53:12.540 --> 03:53:15.380]   Which way did he go?
[03:53:15.380 --> 03:53:18.900]   Makiin knelt in the grass, searching, fingertips running across the ground.
[03:53:18.900 --> 03:53:22.180]   They came away, sticky.
[03:53:22.180 --> 03:53:24.300]   Blood.
[03:53:24.300 --> 03:53:27.740]   Another patch apace up the embankment.
[03:53:27.740 --> 03:53:32.860]   Something crossed Makiin's face, part snarl, part smile, and he bounded up the slope to
[03:53:32.860 --> 03:53:35.260]   the road.
[03:53:35.260 --> 03:53:39.060]   Battle was mostly finished here, the dead littering the ground, others lying and waiting
[03:53:39.060 --> 03:53:42.820]   for death's last touch, wounds gaping.
[03:53:42.820 --> 03:53:50.100]   Screams and weeping, ragged breaths, some men just sitting, staring at blood-crusted palms.
[03:53:50.100 --> 03:53:55.300]   Gold still raged further along the road, the trees of fawn a tunnel about them.
[03:53:55.300 --> 03:54:00.300]   Makiin glimpsed Kadashim in their coats of dark mails scattered amongst the black and
[03:54:00.300 --> 03:54:03.460]   silver of Veridiss's rearguard.
[03:54:03.460 --> 03:54:07.940]   A figure moved beyond the combat, drawing his eye, disappeared, reappeared.
[03:54:07.940 --> 03:54:14.100]   A man, dark-haired, just a glimpse, but Makiin knew him.
[03:54:14.100 --> 03:54:15.980]   Jaiel.
[03:54:15.980 --> 03:54:21.340]   He ran, leaping the fawn, a short sword hissing from a scabbard across his back, a knife gripped
[03:54:21.340 --> 03:54:25.880]   in his other hand, never taking his eyes from Jaiel.
[03:54:25.880 --> 03:54:29.180]   Behind him, Makiin heard the drum of many feet.
[03:54:29.180 --> 03:54:34.460]   Over it, a heavier thud, knew that Alcion and the others had arrived.
[03:54:34.460 --> 03:54:39.580]   He ran on, skirting the combat, glimpsed Veridiss with a handful of men bring a Kadashim to
[03:54:39.580 --> 03:54:44.340]   bay like a hound snapping at a bear or wolfen.
[03:54:44.340 --> 03:54:48.660]   Makiin gave it all barely a glance because he was close to Jaiel now, so close he could
[03:54:48.660 --> 03:54:52.420]   see his eyes that cut across his scalp.
[03:54:52.420 --> 03:54:57.340]   He was heading diagonally across the combat through it and Makiin followed, a wraith that
[03:54:57.340 --> 03:55:04.220]   wound his way through the tumult, ducking, bending, swaying, always moving.
[03:55:04.220 --> 03:55:10.260]   Dimly behind him, he heard voices raised in battle cry, Alcion's deep bass rumbling over
[03:55:10.260 --> 03:55:13.940]   it like an avalanche as he joined the fray.
[03:55:13.940 --> 03:55:15.260]   Makiin hardly noticed.
[03:55:15.260 --> 03:55:19.300]   He was so close, a dozen paces behind Jaiel, when he lost sight of him for a moment, heard
[03:55:19.300 --> 03:55:24.520]   the harsh clang of iron, a grunt, the thud of a body hitting the ground, then a scream,
[03:55:24.520 --> 03:55:31.980]   higher pitched, a woman's scream, "No, dear Alcion, no."
[03:55:31.980 --> 03:55:38.300]   He knew that voice, would recognize it anywhere, fiddly.
[03:55:38.300 --> 03:55:41.900]   He shouldered one of Ripper's warriors out of the way and burst through the last knot
[03:55:41.900 --> 03:55:43.660]   of combat.
[03:55:43.660 --> 03:55:49.020]   A warrior lay dead at his feet, others standing, pointing swords and spears at a figure further
[03:55:49.020 --> 03:55:51.300]   along the road.
[03:55:51.300 --> 03:55:53.300]   Jaiel.
[03:55:53.300 --> 03:55:58.100]   He stood facing Makiin, one arm around Fidole's throat, resting his sword blade against the
[03:55:58.100 --> 03:56:02.340]   pulse in her neck, his other hand holding a knife tight to her ribs.
[03:56:02.340 --> 03:56:09.040]   "Follow me and she's dead," Jaiel said calmly.
[03:56:09.040 --> 03:56:12.260]   He shuffled backwards, dragging Fidole with him.
[03:56:12.260 --> 03:56:16.620]   She saw Makiin appear from the crowd, their eyes touching.
[03:56:16.620 --> 03:56:17.780]   She did not appear scared.
[03:56:17.780 --> 03:56:21.340]   If anything, she looked angry.
[03:56:21.340 --> 03:56:24.100]   An emotion I know well.
[03:56:24.100 --> 03:56:28.820]   A warrior beside Makiin took a step forwards and Jaiel moved, a line of blood trickled
[03:56:28.820 --> 03:56:32.060]   from the blade at Fidole's throat.
[03:56:32.060 --> 03:56:35.220]   Makiin grabbed a fistful of the warrior's shirt and held him still.
[03:56:35.220 --> 03:56:40.700]   "That's better," Jaiel said, a smile twitching his lips.
[03:56:40.700 --> 03:56:43.300]   How Makiin hated that smile.
[03:56:43.300 --> 03:56:46.180]   "I'm going to walk away.
[03:56:46.180 --> 03:56:47.180]   Have no fear.
[03:56:47.180 --> 03:56:48.340]   I'm not a harmless lady.
[03:56:48.340 --> 03:56:52.060]   I know who she is, Fidole of Tenabral.
[03:56:52.060 --> 03:56:55.700]   She will be safe with me, but she will stay with me.
[03:56:55.700 --> 03:56:58.880]   And if any of you should follow..."
[03:56:58.880 --> 03:57:02.660]   He prodded Fidole in the ribs with his knife, making her grimace.
[03:57:02.660 --> 03:57:05.340]   She was still staring at Makiin.
[03:57:05.340 --> 03:57:10.980]   "Trust me," Makiin mouthed, then stepped out from the crowd.
[03:57:10.980 --> 03:57:15.860]   The muscles in Jaiel's sword arm tensed, then he recognized Makiin and paused.
[03:57:15.860 --> 03:57:18.660]   "Not you again," Jaiel sighed.
[03:57:18.660 --> 03:57:21.660]   "Don't you ever give up."
[03:57:21.660 --> 03:57:23.100]   Makiin took a pace forwards.
[03:57:23.100 --> 03:57:28.060]   "Do you wish to be responsible for the death of Fidole, Lady of Tenabral?"
[03:57:28.060 --> 03:57:32.260]   Jaiel snapped, resuming his slow shuffle back down the road.
[03:57:32.260 --> 03:57:38.420]   "Kill her," Makiin growled, taking another step forwards, focused on Jaiel's eyes.
[03:57:38.420 --> 03:57:42.220]   "Stay back," Jaiel said, his voice rising in pitch.
[03:57:42.220 --> 03:57:43.220]   "Or she dies."
[03:57:43.220 --> 03:57:46.420]   "Did you not hear me?"
[03:57:46.420 --> 03:57:48.700]   Makiin said, taking another step.
[03:57:48.700 --> 03:57:50.060]   "Kill her.
[03:57:50.060 --> 03:57:51.700]   I cannot.
[03:57:51.700 --> 03:57:55.820]   Either way, this is where you die.
[03:57:55.820 --> 03:57:58.980]   Nothing will change that now."
[03:57:58.980 --> 03:58:04.180]   He took another pace forwards and another, closing a gap between them.
[03:58:04.180 --> 03:58:07.580]   Jaiel stumbled backwards, dragging Fidole with him.
[03:58:07.580 --> 03:58:09.540]   "Are you mad?
[03:58:09.540 --> 03:58:11.620]   She is the mother of Nethere.
[03:58:11.620 --> 03:58:13.780]   She is the first Lady of Tenabral.
[03:58:13.780 --> 03:58:16.580]   Her war band is standing behind you.
[03:58:16.580 --> 03:58:20.020]   Harm her and they will gut you."
[03:58:20.020 --> 03:58:21.020]   Makiin shrugged.
[03:58:21.020 --> 03:58:24.980]   "Once you're dead, they can do what they like to me."
[03:58:24.980 --> 03:58:29.500]   "Stop," Jaiel screeched, his knife hand pulling back.
[03:58:29.500 --> 03:58:30.500]   Makiin stopped.
[03:58:30.500 --> 03:58:36.300]   "I have an offer for you," he said as he slowly bent his knees, laid his sword and knife on
[03:58:36.300 --> 03:58:37.300]   the ground.
[03:58:37.300 --> 03:58:38.300]   "An offer?
[03:58:38.300 --> 03:58:39.300]   Aye."
[03:58:39.300 --> 03:58:45.300]   Makiin reached over his shoulder and drew his other sword, laid that on the ground too,
[03:58:45.300 --> 03:58:49.780]   unsheathed a knife from his belt, another from a shoulder strap, one from the back of
[03:58:49.780 --> 03:58:53.180]   his boot, laying them all upon the ground.
[03:58:53.180 --> 03:58:55.660]   "Let her go.
[03:58:55.660 --> 03:58:58.900]   I'll fight you unarmed.
[03:58:58.900 --> 03:59:02.020]   Keep your sword and your knife."
[03:59:02.020 --> 03:59:05.700]   He stood straight and raised his hands, started walking forwards again.
[03:59:05.700 --> 03:59:11.300]   "You're insane," Jaiel snorted, eyes glancing from Makiin to the pile of weapons on the
[03:59:11.300 --> 03:59:12.300]   ground.
[03:59:12.300 --> 03:59:15.180]   "Maybe," Makiin shrugged.
[03:59:15.180 --> 03:59:19.060]   "He murdered my wards, my friend.
[03:59:19.060 --> 03:59:22.060]   Castell was as a son to me.
[03:59:22.060 --> 03:59:30.040]   I will see you dead, even if I have to do it with my bare hands."
[03:59:30.040 --> 03:59:32.580]   He could see the indecision in Jaiel's eyes.
[03:59:32.580 --> 03:59:33.580]   The man was tempted.
[03:59:33.580 --> 03:59:37.460]   That was clear, and why not?
[03:59:37.460 --> 03:59:42.080]   He was a master with the sword, with any blade, and had both sword and knife in his hands
[03:59:42.080 --> 03:59:43.740]   against an unarmed man.
[03:59:43.740 --> 03:59:46.980]   "You've more knives hidden away?"
[03:59:46.980 --> 03:59:49.060]   "No," Makiin shook his head.
[03:59:49.060 --> 03:59:52.420]   "You're just afraid to fight me?"
[03:59:52.420 --> 03:59:54.980]   Jaiel snorted, but stopped his backward shuffling.
[03:59:54.980 --> 03:59:58.500]   "You're afraid," Makiin said louder.
[03:59:58.500 --> 04:00:06.060]   "You, Jaiel, murderer and usurper, are coward as well."
[04:00:06.060 --> 04:00:09.640]   A moment's pause, Jaiel's eyes narrowing.
[04:00:09.640 --> 04:00:14.020]   Then he was lifting his sword arm to club Fidele across the back of the head.
[04:00:14.020 --> 04:00:18.500]   In that breath, she stamped on his foot and drove an elbow into his ribs, spinning around
[04:00:18.500 --> 04:00:21.220]   and driving her knee into his groin.
[04:00:21.220 --> 04:00:26.580]   Jaiel staggered and rocked backwards, and then Fidele was leaping away from him.
[04:00:26.580 --> 04:00:27.580]   "Bitch!"
[04:00:27.580 --> 04:00:31.380]   Jaiel snarled, moving after her but clumsily.
[04:00:31.380 --> 04:00:34.180]   In a heartbeat, Makiin was standing in front of her.
[04:00:34.180 --> 04:00:35.180]   "Go!"
[04:00:35.180 --> 04:00:38.380]   Makiin breathed as he squeezed Fidele's hand.
[04:00:38.380 --> 04:00:42.740]   Dimly, he was aware of silence settling behind him.
[04:00:42.740 --> 04:00:48.460]   "Go!" he said firmer, and heard her footsteps pad a dozen or so paces away.
[04:00:48.460 --> 04:00:54.120]   Jaiel paused, looking at Makiin's empty hands.
[04:00:54.120 --> 04:00:58.340]   "You really don't have any more weapons?" he said.
[04:00:58.340 --> 04:00:59.340]   Another smirk.
[04:00:59.340 --> 04:01:01.620]   "You actually are insane.
[04:01:01.620 --> 04:01:02.820]   I'm going to enjoy this."
[04:01:02.820 --> 04:01:06.780]   "Don't need my own blade," Makiin said.
[04:01:06.780 --> 04:01:10.340]   "I'll just take one of yours."
[04:01:10.340 --> 04:01:15.540]   He strode forwards, swayed away from Jaiel's diagonally chopping sawn, pivoted past a stab
[04:01:15.540 --> 04:01:21.180]   of Jaiel's knife, stepped in close and punched Jaiel in the ribs, making him cry out.
[04:01:21.180 --> 04:01:26.020]   Another punch to the sword-cut on Jaiel's leg elicited a grunt of pain.
[04:01:26.020 --> 04:01:31.300]   "For Castell," Makiin said, close to Jaiel's ear.
[04:01:31.300 --> 04:01:33.960]   Then he was spinning away.
[04:01:33.960 --> 04:01:40.100]   Jaiel cursed, visibly mastered his pain, set his stance and came at Makiin, carefully,
[04:01:40.100 --> 04:01:43.460]   sword held high, knife low.
[04:01:43.460 --> 04:01:48.140]   Makiin stepped in to meet Jaiel, palm of his hand slapping the blade of Jaiel's sword away
[04:01:48.140 --> 04:01:52.580]   as he attempted a straight lunge, grabbed Jaiel's knife-wrist and head-butted the man
[04:01:52.580 --> 04:01:55.780]   full on the bridge of his nose.
[04:01:55.780 --> 04:02:00.020]   Jaiel spluttered, blood gushing, Makiin shoving him back.
[04:02:00.020 --> 04:02:03.820]   "For Castell," Makiin growled.
[04:02:03.820 --> 04:02:10.420]   Jaiel's spat, cuffed blood from his face, danced forward, swinging his sword.
[04:02:10.420 --> 04:02:14.700]   Pain ducked, air whistling over his head, he twisted, felt a hot pain lance along his
[04:02:14.700 --> 04:02:15.700]   ribs.
[04:02:15.700 --> 04:02:20.460]   Heard shouting behind him, punched Jaiel on his injured leg again as he spun out of range,
[04:02:20.460 --> 04:02:22.420]   heard another cry of pain.
[04:02:22.420 --> 04:02:26.660]   "For Castell," he breathed.
[04:02:26.660 --> 04:02:29.900]   Jaiel looked at a red line that his knife had scored through the leather of Makiin's
[04:02:29.900 --> 04:02:30.900]   jerkin.
[04:02:30.900 --> 04:02:31.900]   "Bleed!
[04:02:31.900 --> 04:02:34.580]   Like the rest of us then!"
[04:02:34.580 --> 04:02:39.260]   Makiin ignored him and darted forwards, weaved past a sword thrust, kicked out at Jaiel's
[04:02:39.260 --> 04:02:45.860]   ankle, connecting, hand chopping at Jaiel's throat, grabbing his knife hand and twisting.
[04:02:45.860 --> 04:02:50.860]   Jaiel squawked in pain, his knife clattering to the road, Makiin kicking it away and darting
[04:02:50.860 --> 04:02:52.460]   out of range.
[04:02:52.460 --> 04:02:56.780]   "For Castell," he said as he spun away again.
[04:02:56.780 --> 04:02:58.580]   "Stop saying that!"
[04:02:58.580 --> 04:03:04.300]   Jaiel yelled at him, spittle flying, then ran at him, more of a hobble.
[04:03:04.300 --> 04:03:08.900]   Makiin stooped to sweep up the fallen knife, twisting away from Jaiel's sword, slashed
[04:03:08.900 --> 04:03:11.180]   once with the knife.
[04:03:11.180 --> 04:03:15.180]   Jaiel cried out with pain as he stumbled on, almost falling.
[04:03:15.180 --> 04:03:19.100]   He regained his balance and backed away from Makiin, limping as blood ran down the back
[04:03:19.100 --> 04:03:20.980]   of his leg.
[04:03:20.980 --> 04:03:25.460]   Makiin strode at him, for the first time seeing fear in Jaiel's eyes.
[04:03:25.460 --> 04:03:27.940]   "Do you remember?
[04:03:27.940 --> 04:03:32.420]   In the tomb beneath Haldis," Makiin said, not breaking his stride.
[04:03:32.420 --> 04:03:37.300]   "It was a fair fight," Jaiel said, pleading, shuffling away, leaving a trail of blood from
[04:03:37.300 --> 04:03:38.660]   his wounded leg.
[04:03:38.660 --> 04:03:42.620]   "He was your kin, and you betrayed him.
[04:03:42.620 --> 04:03:48.260]   You murdered him," Makiin said, exploding into movement, leaping forwards, dancing to
[04:03:48.260 --> 04:03:55.060]   the side around Jaiel's sword, a slice at Jaiel's arm, a yell, and the sword was falling.
[04:03:55.060 --> 04:03:59.340]   They crashed into each other, limbs tangled, fell to the ground, rolled, Jaiel finding
[04:03:59.340 --> 04:04:03.900]   new strength as he punched, kicked, and bit at Makiin.
[04:04:03.900 --> 04:04:08.220]   Makiin grabbed one of Jaiel's arms, pinned it as they rolled together, inched his knife
[04:04:08.220 --> 04:04:11.020]   blade up towards Jaiel's throat.
[04:04:11.020 --> 04:04:19.340]   Jaiel's efforts redoubled, his free fist punching at Makiin's head, his guts, anywhere, everywhere.
[04:04:19.340 --> 04:04:22.460]   Makiin grunted but did not let go.
[04:04:22.460 --> 04:04:27.500]   Jaiel was grabbing at Makiin's wrist, unable to stop it moving remorselessly upwards.
[04:04:27.500 --> 04:04:33.900]   They rolled to a halt, Makiin squeezed, twisted, and Jaiel's pinned arm cracked.
[04:04:33.900 --> 04:04:40.020]   Jaiel screamed high and long as a stuck bore, the fight draining from him.
[04:04:40.020 --> 04:04:44.220]   Then Makiin's knife was at Jaiel's throat, tip pressing into the soft flesh at the base
[04:04:44.220 --> 04:04:45.220]   of the jaw.
[04:04:45.220 --> 04:04:48.220]   "Please," Jaiel sobbed.
[04:04:48.220 --> 04:04:51.740]   "For Castell," Makiin whispered.
[04:04:51.740 --> 04:04:56.580]   Then he shoved the blade up with all his strength.
[04:04:56.580 --> 04:05:01.220]   Jaiel made a choking sound, gurgling on dark blood that welled from his mouth dribble down
[04:05:01.220 --> 04:05:02.940]   his chin.
[04:05:02.940 --> 04:05:08.220]   He struggled, but Makiin pushed the blade deeper, on into his skull, kept pushing until the
[04:05:08.220 --> 04:05:12.800]   knife's hilt was tight to Jaiel's flesh.
[04:05:12.800 --> 04:05:19.420]   Jaiel's eyes bulged, then he spasmed, legs kicking, slowed, became still.
[04:05:19.420 --> 04:05:23.980]   Makiin rolled away, slowly stood and looked down upon Jaiel.
[04:05:23.980 --> 04:05:29.780]   He grimaced, part snarl, felt suddenly weak and dropped to his knees, then sat and stared
[04:05:29.780 --> 04:05:31.420]   at Jaiel's corpse.
[04:05:31.420 --> 04:05:38.380]   "You are avenged, Castell, you who were like a son to me."
[04:05:38.380 --> 04:05:44.100]   He felt his shoulders begin to shake, tears blur his vision, and then a hand was stroking
[04:05:44.100 --> 04:05:49.020]   his head, a warm body beside him pulling him into an embrace.
[04:05:49.020 --> 04:05:53.020]   He laid his head upon Fidele's breast and wept.
[04:05:53.020 --> 04:05:57.220]   He didn't know how long he remained like that, but in time, the world opened up from that
[04:05:57.220 --> 04:06:01.780]   small pinpoint of grief and he became aware of voices.
[04:06:01.780 --> 04:06:05.620]   He looked up and saw the warband of ripper gathered in a half-circle about him.
[04:06:05.620 --> 04:06:11.260]   There it is, Krellis, Albin, Alcion, and so many others, hundreds of them, all watching
[04:06:11.260 --> 04:06:12.860]   him.
[04:06:12.860 --> 04:06:19.800]   "Well, that was a cracking fire and all denying," Krellis said, nodding to Makiin, lifting a
[04:06:19.800 --> 04:06:22.820]   skin of mead to his lips and drinking deep.
[04:06:22.820 --> 04:06:25.580]   "What now?"
[04:06:25.580 --> 04:06:26.820]   Fidele answered.
[04:06:26.820 --> 04:06:33.380]   "Now, we march on Drassil."
[04:06:33.380 --> 04:06:35.580]   Chapter 18
[04:06:35.580 --> 04:06:38.980]   Coen
[04:06:38.980 --> 04:06:45.260]   Coen stood in the great courtyard before the gates of Drassil alongside her fellow prisoners.
[04:06:45.260 --> 04:06:48.380]   Calidus walked down the staircase that led to the battlements where he had announced
[04:06:48.380 --> 04:06:52.100]   his challenge to Corbin as he did each and every morning.
[04:06:52.100 --> 04:06:55.660]   "Save the lives of your people.
[04:06:55.660 --> 04:06:58.420]   Stop their torture."
[04:06:58.420 --> 04:07:05.420]   As always, Corbin did not come and now Calidus began the second half of each day's ritual,
[04:07:05.420 --> 04:07:10.340]   choosing a prisoner to be impaled within the courtyard.
[04:07:10.340 --> 04:07:15.700]   Almost a moon had passed since Drassil had fallen so unimaginably quickly, a moon of
[04:07:15.700 --> 04:07:19.540]   heartache and pain.
[04:07:19.540 --> 04:07:23.940]   Although she was a prisoner, Coen had been allowed to take charge of the makeshift hospice
[04:07:23.940 --> 04:07:28.580]   that she and Brina had spent so long stocking and preparing, choosing a few staff to help
[04:07:28.580 --> 04:07:31.860]   her from amongst the more able-bodied prisoners.
[04:07:31.860 --> 04:07:35.820]   She was permitted to heal the captured only if she also looked after those in the fairs'
[04:07:35.820 --> 04:07:39.540]   army who had been wounded in the battle.
[04:07:39.540 --> 04:07:46.900]   Such as Coen despised doing so, she knew it was the only way to help her own people.
[04:07:46.900 --> 04:07:51.380]   Calidus stopped a dozen steps up from the courtyard and looked at the gathered prisoners.
[04:07:51.380 --> 04:07:58.780]   "It seems that your bright star has better things to do than save your lives," he said,
[04:07:58.780 --> 04:08:01.060]   voice laced with anger.
[04:08:01.060 --> 04:08:05.860]   Coen shivered involuntarily at the thought of what was to come of the screams.
[04:08:05.860 --> 04:08:10.580]   She was no stranger to death now, but nothing could make her immune to the horror she witnessed
[04:08:10.580 --> 04:08:12.540]   each morning.
[04:08:12.540 --> 04:08:16.460]   "Corbin, come and save us."
[04:08:16.460 --> 04:08:19.180]   With each passing day it seemed more impossible.
[04:08:19.180 --> 04:08:23.700]   For the first few days she had been practically convinced that her brother would somehow return
[04:08:23.700 --> 04:08:28.420]   with a warband and a win-back Drassil defeat their enemy.
[04:08:28.420 --> 04:08:33.820]   But with each scream-filled mourning, that hope had withered.
[04:08:33.820 --> 04:08:38.500]   Calidus gave a curt nod and a cadishim stepped out from the shadows of the stable blocks,
[04:08:38.500 --> 04:08:42.380]   moving amongst the prisoners, dragging one forwards.
[04:08:42.380 --> 04:08:47.500]   As always, Coen's heart seemed to freeze, feeling as if it swelled to fill her chest
[04:08:47.500 --> 04:08:51.900]   as a single cadishim walked down the line that she was standing in.
[04:08:51.900 --> 04:08:57.860]   It was the figure that was always surrounded by billowing clouds of flies.
[04:08:57.860 --> 04:09:02.980]   It paused before her, one fist grabbing her chin and lifting it to stare into her eyes,
[04:09:02.980 --> 04:09:06.780]   though there was nothing there, its eyes were black, soulless wells.
[04:09:06.780 --> 04:09:12.700]   A lunatic grin twisted its mouth and a black tongue flickered out from its mouth, thick
[04:09:12.700 --> 04:09:16.860]   and swollen, and slowly licked her cheek.
[04:09:16.860 --> 04:09:22.100]   She retched from its foul breath, but the cadishim held her immovable while flies crawled
[04:09:22.100 --> 04:09:24.900]   over her face up her nose.
[04:09:24.900 --> 04:09:35.100]   "One day, soon," it whispered in her ear, "I will crush your skull and suck the jelly
[04:09:35.100 --> 04:09:39.000]   from your eyes."
[04:09:39.000 --> 04:09:43.520]   Then it released her, grabbing the man beside her, one of those who had been saved from
[04:09:43.520 --> 04:09:47.540]   the Venthallan orebenches, and dragged him towards a stake.
[04:09:47.540 --> 04:09:50.860]   He began to plead, then wail.
[04:09:50.860 --> 04:09:52.580]   It did no good.
[04:09:52.580 --> 04:09:58.380]   And soon his horrific screams were ringing out, a cacophony of torment.
[04:09:58.380 --> 04:10:00.640]   There was no hiding from it.
[04:10:00.640 --> 04:10:06.720]   The sound climbed, sweeping over the walls and on, out over the plains surrounding the
[04:10:06.720 --> 04:10:10.900]   fortress into the silent trees of Fawn.
[04:10:10.900 --> 04:10:15.820]   Have Corbin and the survivors fled or retreated?
[04:10:15.820 --> 04:10:19.960]   Caledas strode down from the battlement steps and with an irritable wave of his hand, signaled
[04:10:19.960 --> 04:10:23.180]   for the surviving prisoners to be taken away.
[04:10:23.180 --> 04:10:29.060]   The warriors of Tenerbrale, in black and silver, herded Corbin and the others out of the courtyard.
[04:10:29.060 --> 04:10:33.620]   She wrinkled her nose as they passed the stables, the stench of Nefairs draig clawing up her
[04:10:33.620 --> 04:10:34.620]   nose.
[04:10:34.620 --> 04:10:41.380]   She'd smelt a lot of bad things in her time, but nothing like the smell of draig dung.
[04:10:41.380 --> 04:10:45.380]   She heard a hoarse neigh as they moved past the stables.
[04:10:45.380 --> 04:10:47.540]   Shield.
[04:10:47.540 --> 04:10:52.900]   When Drassle had fallen to Caledas and Nefairs Warband, the stables had been full of horses,
[04:10:52.900 --> 04:10:57.220]   great warhorses that the Gehar rode, a whole herd that had been saved from the destruction
[04:10:57.220 --> 04:10:59.820]   of Graham's Hold.
[04:10:59.820 --> 04:11:04.220]   They were still there and created another task that the prisoners were used for, stable
[04:11:04.220 --> 04:11:08.260]   duty, tending to the horses.
[04:11:08.260 --> 04:11:13.660]   Every time that Cohen was picked she had managed to get close to Shield, Corbin's stallion.
[04:11:13.660 --> 04:11:18.260]   As they left the courtyard and entered a wide street, shouts rang out from the wall, then
[04:11:18.260 --> 04:11:21.180]   horns sounded.
[04:11:21.180 --> 04:11:25.100]   The great bars across the gates were drawn back and the gates opened with a juddering
[04:11:25.100 --> 04:11:27.860]   creak.
[04:11:27.860 --> 04:11:32.380]   Figures filled the open gates, silhouettes with the sun behind them.
[04:11:32.380 --> 04:11:35.260]   They became clearer as they spilt into the courtyard.
[04:11:35.260 --> 04:11:41.780]   Within Thallan, a score, two score, maybe more, many of them were wounded.
[04:11:41.780 --> 04:11:48.060]   So something is out there then, hidden within the trees of fawn, something with teeth of
[04:11:48.060 --> 04:11:50.580]   iron.
[04:11:50.580 --> 04:11:56.080]   As she was marched away from the courtyard, Cohen felt a seed of hope glimmer deep inside.
[04:11:56.080 --> 04:12:00.780]   It was feints and fragile and it wasn't helped much by what she saw around her on her way
[04:12:00.780 --> 04:12:03.900]   back to the hospice.
[04:12:03.900 --> 04:12:07.660]   Kaddashim were prowling the streets, moving like shadows, their heads twitching at every
[04:12:07.660 --> 04:12:09.860]   sound.
[04:12:09.860 --> 04:12:13.660]   All around her she saw a host of eagle guard in their black and silver manning gates and
[04:12:13.660 --> 04:12:18.860]   walls, filling once abandoned buildings, working at Forge and Barn, and the Vint Thallan were
[04:12:18.860 --> 04:12:21.020]   everywhere.
[04:12:21.020 --> 04:12:25.000]   Many of them were half drunk and fighting, loitering on street corners, sitting in impromptu
[04:12:25.000 --> 04:12:28.580]   circles and throwing dice of bone.
[04:12:28.580 --> 04:12:33.420]   The numbers of her enemy seemed vast, far more than Corbin's warband had ever been,
[04:12:33.420 --> 04:12:35.900]   even at full strength.
[04:12:35.900 --> 04:12:38.500]   Could we ever have won?
[04:12:38.500 --> 04:12:43.060]   The dead from the battle had mostly been cleared from the streets now, here and there a dark
[04:12:43.060 --> 04:12:47.580]   stain on a flagstone acting as a stark reminder.
[04:12:47.580 --> 04:12:53.500]   As Cohen turned a corner, she saw a dog sniffing at a heaped rubbish pile.
[04:12:53.500 --> 04:12:57.100]   The dog was small and white, a ratter.
[04:12:57.100 --> 04:12:59.340]   I know that dog.
[04:12:59.340 --> 04:13:01.460]   It was Halen's.
[04:13:01.460 --> 04:13:03.940]   What happened to him?
[04:13:03.940 --> 04:13:09.640]   She looked at the dog as she was marched past it, it was skinny and half-starved, ribs visible.
[04:13:09.640 --> 04:13:11.060]   Halen must be dead.
[04:13:11.060 --> 04:13:12.060]   He loved that dog.
[04:13:12.060 --> 04:13:14.860]   Pots, he called him.
[04:13:14.860 --> 04:13:19.800]   Just like my poor Budai, what happened to him?
[04:13:19.800 --> 04:13:22.700]   She had not seen him since before the battle.
[04:13:22.700 --> 04:13:28.460]   Perhaps he had been killed or maybe fled, though deep in her heart she doubted that.
[04:13:28.460 --> 04:13:32.860]   He was too loyal, would not have left me like that.
[04:13:32.860 --> 04:13:36.860]   She drew level with the white dog and clicked her tongue, reached inside a pocket in her
[04:13:36.860 --> 04:13:40.460]   cloak and pulled out a chunk of bread.
[04:13:40.460 --> 04:13:45.300]   The dog lifted its head, sniffing, and after a moment's cautious indecision, darted over
[04:13:45.300 --> 04:13:47.500]   to her.
[04:13:47.500 --> 04:13:52.540]   She dropped the piece of bread and it caught it deftly and it was gone.
[04:13:52.540 --> 04:13:56.340]   She watched its scamper away turn a corner and disappear.
[04:13:56.340 --> 04:14:02.460]   For a moment, she thought she saw something waiting for it, moving in the shadows.
[04:14:02.460 --> 04:14:06.780]   Kids ushered her and the other prisoners into the hospice, less than three hundred of them
[04:14:06.780 --> 04:14:10.280]   now because of Calidus' morning ritual.
[04:14:10.280 --> 04:14:13.700]   The building was large enough to accommodate their numbers with a lower floor made of two
[04:14:13.700 --> 04:14:17.220]   interlinking chambers.
[04:14:17.220 --> 04:14:20.780]   Part of it had been partitioned off for the care of the injured, the rest turned into
[04:14:20.780 --> 04:14:23.700]   a makeshift prison for the others.
[04:14:23.700 --> 04:14:28.220]   Only one guard came into the hospice, the rest sitting out in the courtyard.
[04:14:28.220 --> 04:14:31.940]   Cohen heard the sound of dice on a throw board.
[04:14:31.940 --> 04:14:36.300]   Automatically she went into the adjoining chamber and checked on the injured, not many
[04:14:36.300 --> 04:14:38.640]   of them left now.
[04:14:38.640 --> 04:14:42.540]   There had been a lot more after the battle but many had died, Cohen being unable to do
[04:14:42.540 --> 04:14:47.340]   little more for them than ease their passing across the bridge of swords.
[04:14:47.340 --> 04:14:52.420]   Now only a score remained in here, although, from what she'd just seen, she expected that
[04:14:52.420 --> 04:14:55.740]   her skill would now be required for the injured Vinthalan.
[04:14:55.740 --> 04:15:00.740]   Frankly, she'd rather poison them than heal them.
[04:15:00.740 --> 04:15:07.100]   Do not give up, she told herself, remembering her time as a prisoner with Nathair and Calidus.
[04:15:07.100 --> 04:15:09.980]   All had seemed hopeless then.
[04:15:09.980 --> 04:15:14.380]   That time, Corbin had come out of nowhere and rescued her.
[04:15:14.380 --> 04:15:19.060]   Although ma'am died in the undertaking, I'll not let that happen again, people dying for
[04:15:19.060 --> 04:15:20.060]   my saving.
[04:15:20.060 --> 04:15:21.220]   I'll not wait around to be rescued.
[04:15:21.220 --> 04:15:26.900]   I will make my own fortune, whatever the cost.
[04:15:26.900 --> 04:15:29.620]   Cohen opened her eyes.
[04:15:29.620 --> 04:15:34.060]   After counting a hundred heartbeats and not hearing anything else but the usual snoring,
[04:15:34.060 --> 04:15:37.480]   she turned her head to check on their Vinthalan guard.
[04:15:37.480 --> 04:15:41.240]   As expected, he was asleep.
[04:15:41.240 --> 04:15:45.940]   Beyond the doors she heard the muted sound of conversation, the occasional burst of laughter,
[04:15:45.940 --> 04:15:50.380]   the rest of their guards sitting in the courtyard drinking and gambling.
[04:15:50.380 --> 04:15:55.820]   At first, their guards had been vigilant and, rightly so, because there had been a smattering
[04:15:55.820 --> 04:16:00.880]   of jihar amongst the captives and they did not take well to being made prisoners.
[04:16:00.880 --> 04:16:05.420]   On the first night, two had attempted escape, killing eight guards, maiming three more and
[04:16:05.420 --> 04:16:07.580]   setting fire to another.
[04:16:07.580 --> 04:16:14.420]   Eventually, they had both been subdued and executed in the courtyard the next day.
[04:16:14.420 --> 04:16:19.620]   Since then, no more escapes had been attempted and over time, the guards had become correspondingly
[04:16:19.620 --> 04:16:22.500]   less vigilant.
[04:16:22.500 --> 04:16:26.580]   Cohen padded slowly from the room, making her way to a set of stairs leading up to a
[04:16:26.580 --> 04:16:32.180]   balcony that looked down upon the main hall with a dozen rooms opening off it.
[04:16:32.180 --> 04:16:35.540]   Almost silently, she passed into one of those rooms.
[04:16:35.540 --> 04:16:40.980]   There was one large window that let in a wide beam of moonlight, shockingly bright in the
[04:16:40.980 --> 04:16:43.380]   darkness.
[04:16:43.380 --> 04:16:47.980]   Cohen traced a familiar path to a cupboard, opened the door, shifted a loose board inside
[04:16:47.980 --> 04:16:50.540]   and lifted out a package.
[04:16:50.540 --> 04:16:55.420]   She shuffled over to the window, sat with her back to the wall, facing the dark silhouette
[04:16:55.420 --> 04:16:57.980]   of the open doorway.
[04:16:57.980 --> 04:17:04.040]   She opened the old linen she'd wrapped round it to reveal a book, leather-bound and worn.
[04:17:04.040 --> 04:17:08.860]   She opened it towards the back and started reading the spidery script.
[04:17:08.860 --> 04:17:23.260]   "Rut, eigen, lo, hara, agada," a guarding spell, "akachirantel," boiling water, wormroot,
[04:17:23.260 --> 04:17:25.700]   flayed skin.
[04:17:25.700 --> 04:17:30.620]   She paused there, a shiver goose-bumping her flesh.
[04:17:30.620 --> 04:17:33.720]   What did I expect from a book of giant spells?
[04:17:33.720 --> 04:17:36.820]   She pulled a face, fear and revulsion.
[04:17:36.820 --> 04:17:39.100]   It depends who the skin belonged to, I suppose.
[04:17:39.100 --> 04:17:44.980]   If it came from Calodus or Nefert or Lycus, Morkant or Wrynn, the list grew in her mind
[04:17:44.980 --> 04:17:49.100]   of enemies she'd like to do terrible things to.
[04:17:49.100 --> 04:17:53.140]   Brynner said, "It is a tool, not an evil of itself.
[04:17:53.140 --> 04:17:57.060]   It is how I use it that's important."
[04:17:57.060 --> 04:18:04.460]   She became aware of a sound, a soft snuffling from out of the window, leaves rustled.
[04:18:04.460 --> 04:18:11.140]   Looking in her beds, slowly, as quietly as she could manage, she peered up over the window's
[04:18:11.140 --> 04:18:13.700]   edge and looked out.
[04:18:13.700 --> 04:18:17.900]   Something was moving through the herb garden, nose to the ground, moving steadily towards
[04:18:17.900 --> 04:18:19.700]   the hospice.
[04:18:19.700 --> 04:18:24.660]   It paused, its white form reflecting moonlight, and looked up at Cohen.
[04:18:24.660 --> 04:18:29.500]   "It's the dog from earlier, Halen's ratter."
[04:18:29.500 --> 04:18:33.500]   The dog turned in a circle and jumped on the spot.
[04:18:33.500 --> 04:18:36.380]   As Cohen was scared, they would start barking.
[04:18:36.380 --> 04:18:41.740]   Then, movement caught her eye, further back in her shadowed recess on the far side of
[04:18:41.740 --> 04:18:45.580]   the herb garden, a solid patch in the darkness.
[04:18:45.580 --> 04:18:49.740]   It whined, moved into the moonlight.
[04:18:49.740 --> 04:18:53.020]   Cohen's breath caught in her chest.
[04:18:53.020 --> 04:18:54.300]   "Buddhye."
[04:18:54.300 --> 04:19:00.380]   Without thinking, she jumped from the window, dropping into the soft earth of the herb bed.
[04:19:00.380 --> 04:19:04.580]   As she had righted herself, Buddhye was bounding across the soft earth, hurling himself against
[04:19:04.580 --> 04:19:07.620]   her rough tongue, licking her face, whining.
[04:19:07.620 --> 04:19:14.100]   "Shh," she whispered, tears blurring her eyes as she kissed his muzzle.
[04:19:14.100 --> 04:19:16.340]   He didn't listen to her sloppily licking her face.
[04:19:16.340 --> 04:19:22.660]   "Where have you been?" she whispered, scratching him behind one floppy ear, running her other
[04:19:22.660 --> 04:19:25.340]   hand along the thick muscle of his neck.
[04:19:25.340 --> 04:19:29.700]   "Been feeding all right by the look of you."
[04:19:29.700 --> 04:19:32.020]   Nothing was tied around him.
[04:19:32.020 --> 04:19:37.740]   Cohen lifted it and inspected the long strip of leather, a leash.
[04:19:37.740 --> 04:19:42.220]   Then another sound caught her attention, a rustling close by in the herb bed amongst
[04:19:42.220 --> 04:19:45.580]   the thick leaves of the basil and peppermint.
[04:19:45.580 --> 04:19:52.300]   She squinted, narrowed her eyes, saw someone appear from between the greenery, a face small
[04:19:52.300 --> 04:19:55.780]   and pale, dirt-stained.
[04:19:55.780 --> 04:20:00.660]   It was Halen.
[04:20:00.660 --> 04:20:02.820]   Chapter 19 Huthas
[04:20:02.820 --> 04:20:13.420]   "Ravens and crows," Huthas muttered as he trudged through the marshland, eyes looking skyward.
[04:20:13.420 --> 04:20:18.780]   He stumbled, his foot sinking with a splash into a patch of soft ground, and he leaned
[04:20:18.780 --> 04:20:21.300]   on his spear to lever himself upright.
[04:20:21.300 --> 04:20:26.160]   Salak, his shieldman, reached out a steadying hand from behind him.
[04:20:26.160 --> 04:20:30.140]   "Marshland is not a good place for a giant to walk."
[04:20:30.140 --> 04:20:31.980]   "What's that?"
[04:20:31.980 --> 04:20:33.740]   Rin said.
[04:20:33.740 --> 04:20:37.860]   She was sitting in the stern of a large boat surrounded by a score of warriors as well
[04:20:37.860 --> 04:20:40.060]   as half a dozen rowers.
[04:20:40.060 --> 04:20:43.860]   Huthas was picking a path alongside the banks of the waterway.
[04:20:43.860 --> 04:20:48.820]   She was being rowed down, a line of banothi giants spread out along the bank behind him.
[04:20:48.820 --> 04:20:55.220]   "Ravens and crows," Huthas repeated, stopping and pointing up at the skies where a black
[04:20:55.220 --> 04:20:57.460]   shape spiralled high above them.
[04:20:57.460 --> 04:21:00.060]   "What about them?"
[04:21:00.060 --> 04:21:01.580]   Rin asked.
[04:21:01.580 --> 04:21:05.860]   She was in an unusually good mood this morning, the first that Huthas had seen since she had
[04:21:05.860 --> 04:21:11.180]   learned of her warband's defeat in the marshes and of the death of her huntsman, Braith.
[04:21:11.180 --> 04:21:18.180]   "I don't like them," Huthas grumbled, thinking of Fegh, Naman's treacherous raven.
[04:21:18.180 --> 04:21:21.500]   Rin stared up at the speck in the sky.
[04:21:21.500 --> 04:21:27.340]   "I've always rather like them," she said, "and I suppose this one suspects that we'll
[04:21:27.340 --> 04:21:28.780]   be providing its dinner."
[04:21:28.780 --> 04:21:32.020]   Huthas scowled up at the bird.
[04:21:32.020 --> 04:21:37.580]   "Aye, as long as it's not our eyeballs and innards that it is feasting upon."
[04:21:37.580 --> 04:21:39.540]   He looked around him.
[04:21:39.540 --> 04:21:43.700]   More boats filled the waterway bursting with over a thousand warriors.
[04:21:43.700 --> 04:21:49.000]   "Not likely that we'll be losing this battle," he thought, looking at the grim faces of men
[04:21:49.000 --> 04:21:54.980]   in every boat, bristling with iron and the fifty banathi warriors behind him.
[04:21:54.980 --> 04:21:58.860]   More than enough to put down this little uprising.
[04:21:58.860 --> 04:22:03.260]   But since they had left the tower at the marshland's edge, a dour mood had fallen across Huthas's
[04:22:03.260 --> 04:22:07.300]   shoulders like a heavy cloak and he could not shake it.
[04:22:07.300 --> 04:22:11.020]   We should be getting on with the important business of finding Evanis and the necklace.
[04:22:11.020 --> 04:22:13.940]   That is all that matters.
[04:22:13.940 --> 04:22:17.900]   Because when they found Nemaan's necklace, one of the seven treasures, then Huthas would
[04:22:17.900 --> 04:22:22.460]   be one huge step closer to achieving his dream.
[04:22:22.460 --> 04:22:24.500]   King of the Giants.
[04:22:24.500 --> 04:22:25.940]   No more clans.
[04:22:25.940 --> 04:22:27.100]   No more divisions.
[04:22:27.100 --> 04:22:29.700]   Just my kin behind me.
[04:22:29.700 --> 04:22:32.900]   But first I must find the necklace.
[04:22:32.900 --> 04:22:35.900]   Then it is to Daun and Dontaris to find the cup.
[04:22:35.900 --> 04:22:42.260]   And then... he saw Rafe appear up ahead, moving smoothly across the ground, his two hounds
[04:22:42.260 --> 04:22:43.980]   with him.
[04:22:43.980 --> 04:22:50.940]   He ran across the marshland towards them, hardly glancing at where he was putting his feet.
[04:22:50.940 --> 04:22:55.060]   Everything about the lad screamed vitality.
[04:22:55.060 --> 04:22:57.820]   Huthas rubbed at the small of his back and frowned.
[04:22:57.820 --> 04:23:02.500]   "There is something about him," Huthas mused, "different."
[04:23:02.500 --> 04:23:03.980]   He hides something.
[04:23:03.980 --> 04:23:08.860]   "Rafe comes," Huthas said across the water to Ryn.
[04:23:08.860 --> 04:23:11.260]   She held up a hand.
[04:23:11.260 --> 04:23:16.380]   The rudderman of her boat guided them towards the bank, the rowers slowing.
[04:23:16.380 --> 04:23:21.420]   All along their convoy, men did the same, the boats rippling to a halt like a long sinuous
[04:23:21.420 --> 04:23:22.420]   water snake.
[04:23:22.420 --> 04:23:24.420]   "Is he alone?"
[04:23:24.420 --> 04:23:28.540]   Ryn asked as Huthas took her hand and helped her step from the boat.
[04:23:28.540 --> 04:23:30.420]   "Aye."
[04:23:30.420 --> 04:23:35.060]   Huthas had been given a score of woodsman to help him scout out the rumin's of Duncryn,
[04:23:35.060 --> 04:23:37.060]   not that he seemed to need help.
[04:23:37.060 --> 04:23:41.460]   "Be careful," Huthas said, "I don't trust him."
[04:23:41.460 --> 04:23:47.020]   "I don't trust anyone," Ryn replied with a scathing look and fixed her eyes on Rafe as
[04:23:47.020 --> 04:23:48.860]   he approached them.
[04:23:48.860 --> 04:23:54.500]   His two hounds reached them first, prowling a circle around Huthas which he didn't like.
[04:23:54.500 --> 04:23:58.540]   Rafe sprang across a stream and pulled to a halt, dipping his head to Ryn.
[04:23:58.540 --> 04:24:01.340]   "My queen?" he said.
[04:24:01.340 --> 04:24:02.340]   "Well?"
[04:24:02.340 --> 04:24:03.340]   Ryn snapped.
[04:24:03.340 --> 04:24:05.780]   "Duncryn is ahead."
[04:24:05.780 --> 04:24:07.980]   A smile touched Ryn's mouth.
[04:24:07.980 --> 04:24:09.380]   "It is abandoned."
[04:24:09.380 --> 04:24:17.180]   "Well," he wasn't lying, Huthas thought, as he stepped around a long-branched willow
[04:24:17.180 --> 04:24:20.980]   and saw the ancient fortress towering out of the lake.
[04:24:20.980 --> 04:24:24.060]   He heard Salak mutter a curse behind him.
[04:24:24.060 --> 04:24:27.380]   His shieldmen had not seen Duncryn before and it was a tragic sight.
[04:24:27.380 --> 04:24:32.020]   The once-proud fortress laid low by time and circumstance.
[04:24:32.020 --> 04:24:36.780]   Dark walls and towers reared from the lake's water, like the submerged boughs of a rotting
[04:24:36.780 --> 04:24:41.260]   tree, reed and slime hanging from the decaying battlements.
[04:24:41.260 --> 04:24:44.340]   A great work brought down.
[04:24:44.340 --> 04:24:49.460]   When I am king, I will restore the glory of my kin.
[04:24:49.460 --> 04:24:52.100]   Ahead of him, Ryn hissed in frustration.
[04:24:52.100 --> 04:24:55.580]   "There's no one here," Morkant said.
[04:24:55.580 --> 04:25:02.500]   "Your powers of observation are staggering," Ryn said, barely contained rage dripping from
[04:25:02.500 --> 04:25:04.820]   each word.
[04:25:04.820 --> 04:25:08.940]   A strange sound rang out overhead, making Huthas jump.
[04:25:08.940 --> 04:25:14.160]   He looked up and saw a scruffy-looking crow sitting in the branches of a willow.
[04:25:14.160 --> 04:25:18.500]   It was making a clacking sound, almost like laughing.
[04:25:18.500 --> 04:25:20.980]   Huthas gave it a dark look.
[04:25:20.980 --> 04:25:27.220]   Still making the odd noise, the crow winged into the air, spiralled up and flew away.
[04:25:27.220 --> 04:25:32.300]   Warriors were disembarking from boats to stand all along the lakeshore.
[04:25:32.300 --> 04:25:37.980]   Others had rode out to the waterlogged fortress, men climbing up onto the ancient battlements.
[04:25:37.980 --> 04:25:43.060]   Huthas tugged on one of the worm teeth set in his necklace as he stared at Duncryn, eyes
[04:25:43.060 --> 04:25:47.260]   sweeping the lakeshore, the willows and alders that lined it.
[04:25:47.260 --> 04:25:54.060]   The signs of recent life were all about abandoned shelters, woven willow fences, cold firepits,
[04:25:54.060 --> 04:25:56.260]   fishing nets hanging.
[04:25:56.260 --> 04:26:01.660]   A pile of burned clothing, old boots and belts, some twisted war gear, nothing of much use.
[04:26:01.660 --> 04:26:05.580]   "The far shore," he said to Salak and Iza beside him.
[04:26:05.580 --> 04:26:07.900]   "They have younger eyes than I."
[04:26:07.900 --> 04:26:09.820]   "Men could be hiding there."
[04:26:09.820 --> 04:26:13.860]   "Can't see anything," Salak rumbled.
[04:26:13.860 --> 04:26:16.340]   He was disappointed, Huthas could tell.
[04:26:16.340 --> 04:26:19.060]   His shieldmen had been looking forward to a fight.
[04:26:19.060 --> 04:26:21.860]   "But it's far."
[04:26:21.860 --> 04:26:26.700]   "No one there," Raph said from a dozen strides away, his back to them.
[04:26:26.700 --> 04:26:29.260]   He was standing and staring at the far shore.
[04:26:29.260 --> 04:26:32.980]   "Your eyes are good," Huthas asked.
[04:26:32.980 --> 04:26:38.620]   "I can see a heron standing in the shade of that willow," Raph said, pointing.
[04:26:38.620 --> 04:26:43.780]   Huthas squinted but could see nothing, neither could Salak.
[04:26:43.780 --> 04:26:49.860]   Then there was a distant splash and a heron rose from deep shadows, flapping into the air.
[04:26:49.860 --> 04:26:54.420]   Rynn barked orders and warriors began to sweep around both arms of the lake shore, searching
[04:26:54.420 --> 04:26:57.940]   for hidden men wary of traps.
[04:26:57.940 --> 04:27:01.300]   Word of the last campaign against this fortress was in everyone's mind.
[04:27:01.300 --> 04:27:04.740]   "Why have they left here?"
[04:27:04.740 --> 04:27:06.260]   Morkant asked no one in particular.
[04:27:06.260 --> 04:27:11.020]   "To avoid you, I would suspect," Rynn said.
[04:27:11.020 --> 04:27:13.820]   Morkant nodded at that, thinking it a perfectly reasonable answer.
[04:27:13.820 --> 04:27:16.900]   "Well, we must chase them then," he said.
[04:27:16.900 --> 04:27:18.900]   "A fine idea," Rynn muttered.
[04:27:18.900 --> 04:27:20.020]   "Or maybe not.
[04:27:20.020 --> 04:27:22.740]   What do you think, Raph?"
[04:27:22.740 --> 04:27:25.660]   The young huntsman frowned at that, was silent a while.
[04:27:25.660 --> 04:27:30.740]   "I can track them for you, my lady," he eventually said, "but I don't think it would be wise
[04:27:30.740 --> 04:27:33.700]   for your whole war-band to give chase.
[04:27:33.700 --> 04:27:37.740]   We could be led straight into another trap like last time, or worse.
[04:27:37.740 --> 04:27:43.340]   Here we know the land, now, and your numbers would tell, out there," he gestured at the
[04:27:43.340 --> 04:27:47.340]   stinking marshland, "who knows?"
[04:27:47.340 --> 04:27:53.500]   Calls were drifting over from the fortress, men signaling that the ruins were empty.
[04:27:53.500 --> 04:27:57.580]   Other men started adding their voices from the lake shore as they circled around.
[04:27:57.580 --> 04:28:00.020]   "They're fled?"
[04:28:00.020 --> 04:28:01.020]   Salak rumbled.
[04:28:01.020 --> 04:28:03.020]   "Yes," Rynn agreed sourly.
[04:28:03.020 --> 04:28:07.180]   "But the question is not why, but where.
[04:28:07.180 --> 04:28:08.180]   Where are they?
[04:28:08.180 --> 04:28:11.460]   Why, we are stuck in the heart of Duncrynn.
[04:28:11.460 --> 04:28:12.460]   Where are they?
[04:28:12.460 --> 04:28:14.580]   And what are they doing?"
[04:28:14.580 --> 04:28:16.720]   "And where is Evaness?"
[04:28:16.720 --> 04:28:17.720]   Uthas thought.
[04:28:17.720 --> 04:28:20.020]   "He is the real prize.
[04:28:20.020 --> 04:28:22.900]   The only man with knowledge of where Naman's necklace is.
[04:28:22.900 --> 04:28:26.640]   All else is smoke on the wind."
[04:28:26.640 --> 04:28:29.140]   Voices shouted from further along the lake shore.
[04:28:29.140 --> 04:28:31.700]   A different tone and cadence.
[04:28:31.700 --> 04:28:36.900]   Men appeared with some undefinitely unworrier-like between them.
[04:28:36.900 --> 04:28:42.380]   She was brought before Rynn, a woman of exceeding beauty, Uthas surmised, beneath the starvation
[04:28:42.380 --> 04:28:45.380]   and grime that coated her.
[04:28:45.380 --> 04:28:48.400]   She was dark-haired with green eyes.
[04:28:48.400 --> 04:28:53.740]   As she was held before Rynn, Uthas saw her host of emotions sweep this new woman's face,
[04:28:53.740 --> 04:28:59.380]   pride, fear, hatred, hope.
[04:28:59.380 --> 04:29:06.420]   Rynn stared at her, then began to laugh.
[04:29:06.420 --> 04:29:08.180]   Question 20.
[04:29:08.180 --> 04:29:09.180]   Kamalyn
[04:29:09.180 --> 04:29:15.500]   "Torch it," Kamalyn said, lifting his bow.
[04:29:15.500 --> 04:29:20.740]   A flaming arrow leapt into the air, followed by 20 more, all rising high into the blue
[04:29:20.740 --> 04:29:25.820]   sky, then arcing and falling towards the wooden tower and surrounding walls.
[04:29:25.820 --> 04:29:31.940]   Again, Kamalyn ordered, as the first volley slammed into the wooden palisade, gates and
[04:29:31.940 --> 04:29:34.700]   buildings beyond.
[04:29:34.700 --> 04:29:39.540]   Meg dipped her torch into an iron brazier, crackling with fire and ran along the line
[04:29:39.540 --> 04:29:43.500]   igniting the arrows of Kamalyn and the 20 other archers.
[04:29:43.500 --> 04:29:48.100]   They were standing on a shallow slope between the marshes and Morcan's tower, it done as
[04:29:48.100 --> 04:29:51.860]   warbands spread in a loose circle about it.
[04:29:51.860 --> 04:29:58.180]   On a plane to Kamalyn's right stood the remains of an abandoned camp, trampled grass, firepits,
[04:29:58.180 --> 04:30:01.020]   torn tents, the stench of midden.
[04:30:01.020 --> 04:30:06.100]   A lot of men filled that space, Rynn's not underestimating us this time, though she'll
[04:30:06.100 --> 04:30:09.700]   be finding out soon that we're not playing by her rules.
[04:30:09.700 --> 04:30:16.660]   Kamalyn held his arrow tip in Meg's torch, the pitch and kindling catching with a hiss,
[04:30:16.660 --> 04:30:21.900]   and then he was aiming high and loosing, his arrow rising and falling amongst the others,
[04:30:21.900 --> 04:30:25.420]   disappearing beyond the wall of Morcan's tower.
[04:30:25.420 --> 04:30:29.900]   Already black smoke was billowing into the clear sky.
[04:30:29.900 --> 04:30:34.700]   "You'll see that for a fair few leagues around," Baird said behind him, grinning as if he was
[04:30:34.700 --> 04:30:37.260]   in a Midsummer's fair.
[04:30:37.260 --> 04:30:42.740]   He was stood to one side of Idana, Halien and Von close by, as well as Lorcan and his
[04:30:42.740 --> 04:30:44.540]   shieldmen, Brogan.
[04:30:44.540 --> 04:30:47.880]   "That's the idea," Idana said.
[04:30:47.880 --> 04:30:48.880]   She was sterner.
[04:30:48.880 --> 04:30:52.260]   "Too long, Rynn has had this war her own way."
[04:30:52.260 --> 04:30:55.900]   "Aye, this is a message as much as anything else.
[04:30:55.900 --> 04:31:00.300]   Well, we'll not be dancing to Rynn's tune any longer."
[04:31:00.300 --> 04:31:04.620]   Kamalyn held out another arrow for Meg to light.
[04:31:04.620 --> 04:31:10.000]   The Gate Tower was a crackling torch now, Morcan's tower beyond catching bright flames
[04:31:10.000 --> 04:31:12.940]   licking one side.
[04:31:12.940 --> 04:31:15.940]   Figures were running along the wall, buckets of water were being thrown, but it seemed
[04:31:15.940 --> 04:31:17.460]   to be having little effect.
[04:31:17.460 --> 04:31:20.140]   "Too few of them," Kamalyn thought.
[04:31:20.140 --> 04:31:24.060]   "Can't be more than thirty men in there."
[04:31:24.060 --> 04:31:27.740]   Rynn's taken everyone else into the marshes, looking for us.
[04:31:27.740 --> 04:31:30.940]   A broad smile cracked his face as he thought of Rynn's expression when she heard about
[04:31:30.940 --> 04:31:31.940]   this.
[04:31:31.940 --> 04:31:37.540]   "That should do it," he said, slapping men on shoulders, and the row of archers lowered
[04:31:37.540 --> 04:31:38.860]   their bows.
[04:31:38.860 --> 04:31:40.940]   "Now what?"
[04:31:40.940 --> 04:31:41.940]   Idana asked.
[04:31:41.940 --> 04:31:42.940]   "Now?
[04:31:42.940 --> 04:31:44.440]   We wait?"
[04:31:44.440 --> 04:31:45.440]   Kamalyn said.
[04:31:45.440 --> 04:31:47.860]   "Shouldn't take long."
[04:31:47.860 --> 04:31:48.860]   He was right.
[04:31:48.860 --> 04:31:50.820]   He didn't.
[04:31:50.820 --> 04:31:56.080]   Soon enough, the palisade and enclosure were burning like a forest fire.
[04:31:56.080 --> 04:32:00.140]   One desperate man leapt over the palisade, apprehended immediately by a pandathrin and
[04:32:00.140 --> 04:32:03.900]   his men, followed shortly by others.
[04:32:03.900 --> 04:32:08.420]   Soon after the gates creaked open, black clouds of smoke billowing out, and a huddle of men
[04:32:08.420 --> 04:32:13.020]   appeared, stumbling and coughing out onto the slope.
[04:32:13.020 --> 04:32:15.380]   Some collapsed to the ground.
[04:32:15.380 --> 04:32:20.760]   Others stood with their arms raised in surrender as Idana's warriors closed in.
[04:32:20.760 --> 04:32:24.740]   Idana herded the gathered prisoners down the slope.
[04:32:24.740 --> 04:32:30.080]   Kamalyn glanced at Idana as she sighed and strode off towards the prisoners.
[04:32:30.080 --> 04:32:32.380]   Kamalyn and the others followed.
[04:32:32.380 --> 04:32:36.940]   Thirty-six men were kneeling in the grass before Idana.
[04:32:36.940 --> 04:32:41.260]   They all wore the black and gold of Kamran, Rynn's realm.
[04:32:41.260 --> 04:32:43.380]   Idana stood and stared at them a long moment.
[04:32:43.380 --> 04:32:47.720]   "How many of you were ardent born?" she asked.
[04:32:47.720 --> 04:32:51.140]   Others looked up at her, some nodding, others raising her hand.
[04:32:51.140 --> 04:32:53.700]   "Twenty-eight," Kamalyn counted.
[04:32:53.700 --> 04:32:58.900]   "Narvon," Idana asked, and Drus stepped out from the warriors at her back.
[04:32:58.900 --> 04:33:01.340]   Five raised their hands.
[04:33:01.340 --> 04:33:03.620]   Drus narrowed his eyes and stared at them.
[04:33:03.620 --> 04:33:06.020]   "Which three are from Kamran?"
[04:33:06.020 --> 04:33:07.520]   Idana asked.
[04:33:07.520 --> 04:33:11.860]   Two raised their hands and Kamalyn saw one other who was staring fixedly at the grass
[04:33:11.860 --> 04:33:12.860]   at his knees.
[04:33:12.860 --> 04:33:19.900]   "Bring them before me," Idana said, and Halion, Baird and Von moved into the crowd, dragging
[04:33:19.900 --> 04:33:22.820]   the two who had raised their hands out of the group.
[04:33:22.820 --> 04:33:28.180]   "That one," Kamalyn said, pointing at the other one, and he was dragged forwards too
[04:33:28.180 --> 04:33:30.340]   and thrown to the ground before Idana.
[04:33:30.340 --> 04:33:33.180]   "You are from Kamran," she said.
[04:33:33.180 --> 04:33:40.100]   "You have come here to Arden with Rynn, invaded my country, killed my people."
[04:33:40.100 --> 04:33:42.060]   There was a tremor of rage in her voice.
[04:33:42.060 --> 04:33:46.740]   "You deserve death," Idana said, "and I sentence you to execution."
[04:33:46.740 --> 04:33:50.260]   Idana approached the other prisoners.
[04:33:50.260 --> 04:33:54.300]   "You others, you are Arden and Narvon born," she said.
[04:33:54.300 --> 04:33:55.300]   Men nodded eagerly.
[04:33:55.300 --> 04:33:56.300]   She frowned at them.
[04:33:56.300 --> 04:34:00.180]   "And yet you wear the colours of Rynn, Queen of Kamran.
[04:34:00.180 --> 04:34:04.340]   You have betrayed your country, served your enemy."
[04:34:04.340 --> 04:34:07.380]   Kamalyn saw fear ripple through them like wind through long grass.
[04:34:07.380 --> 04:34:10.340]   "I will offer you my forgiveness."
[04:34:10.340 --> 04:34:12.540]   "Once."
[04:34:12.540 --> 04:34:16.180]   "Think more and one of them will need to change their britches."
[04:34:16.180 --> 04:34:19.340]   "I will give you a choice.
[04:34:19.340 --> 04:34:23.960]   Fight for me, for your countries, or go home.
[04:34:23.960 --> 04:34:26.940]   Either way, you redeem yourselves."
[04:34:26.940 --> 04:34:28.940]   She looked long and hard at their faces.
[04:34:28.940 --> 04:34:34.820]   "If you go now, I shall not judge you, but if I see your faces again and you're standing
[04:34:34.820 --> 04:34:38.940]   against me, I'll see you die a death worthy of your betrayal.
[04:34:38.940 --> 04:34:45.300]   Make your choice," Idana said, and without waiting to see their reactions, she turned
[04:34:45.300 --> 04:34:47.700]   and strode away.
[04:34:47.700 --> 04:34:51.820]   Only Kamalyn saw the tears fill her eyes.
[04:34:51.820 --> 04:34:57.580]   Kamalyn sat with his back to a tree and watched Morcan's tower crumble in upon itself, a great
[04:34:57.580 --> 04:35:02.420]   cloud of smoke and ash billowing up into the air.
[04:35:02.420 --> 04:35:06.920]   He could see the bulk of Pendathrin as he led fifty men away to the east, skirting the
[04:35:06.920 --> 04:35:09.660]   tree line of the woods.
[04:35:09.660 --> 04:35:16.620]   Another group of men were waiting down there for Drust, going a separate ways for a while.
[04:35:16.620 --> 04:35:23.140]   The plan was to split into three groups, Pendathrin, Drust and Idana each leading a band of warriors,
[04:35:23.140 --> 04:35:28.560]   the overall goal of each to make life in Arden hard for Rin.
[04:35:28.560 --> 04:35:34.380]   With a loud crash, the final section of Morcan's tower collapsed.
[04:35:34.380 --> 04:35:38.540]   Regretting grinned, wishing he could see Morcan's face when he marched out of the marshes to
[04:35:38.540 --> 04:35:39.540]   see it.
[04:35:39.540 --> 04:35:45.300]   "A pretty sight, that's how a common down," he commented, as he leaned forwards and took
[04:35:45.300 --> 04:35:49.940]   a skewer of squirrel meat off the fire, tossing it to Meg.
[04:35:49.940 --> 04:35:55.200]   She took the meat, blowing on her fingers and biting, grease dripping down her chin.
[04:35:55.200 --> 04:35:58.740]   We'll have to talk to her soon.
[04:35:58.740 --> 04:36:02.180]   He was surprised to find he felt sad about that.
[04:36:02.180 --> 04:36:06.100]   Strange as it seems, she's not the worst company.
[04:36:06.100 --> 04:36:10.540]   The drumbeats of hooves drew his eyes, and Camlin watched a dozen riders countering away
[04:36:10.540 --> 04:36:15.100]   in different directions, each with a large bag of silver taken from Morcan's chest, each
[04:36:15.100 --> 04:36:19.780]   one tasked with travelling through as many villages and holds as possible, spreading
[04:36:19.780 --> 04:36:24.660]   the word of Idana's victory at Dunkrin that she was alive and well in Arden and that she
[04:36:24.660 --> 04:36:29.980]   was fighting, and of course distributing a little silver to show that there was a bit
[04:36:29.980 --> 04:36:32.900]   of profit to be had if you rode with Idana.
[04:36:32.900 --> 04:36:38.340]   "We're moving forwards, closer to the end whether that be victory or death."
[04:36:38.340 --> 04:36:43.660]   "We'll be leaving the marshes behind us soon," he said conversationally.
[04:36:43.660 --> 04:36:47.460]   "I know that," Meg said, as if he was stupid.
[04:36:47.460 --> 04:36:52.060]   "Might be best for you if you and I made a trip to the next village along the marshes
[04:36:52.060 --> 04:36:56.020]   edge, and I found a family to take you in."
[04:36:56.020 --> 04:36:58.620]   Her head snapped round and she glared at him.
[04:36:58.620 --> 04:36:59.620]   "No!"
[04:36:59.620 --> 04:37:04.100]   "This is your home, Meg," he said, with a jerk of his chin.
[04:37:04.100 --> 04:37:11.660]   "The marshlands, these people, we'll be leaving here, going back to Woodin Forest.
[04:37:11.660 --> 04:37:13.980]   That's where my kind of fighting works best."
[04:37:13.980 --> 04:37:19.020]   "We're going to war," he said, "and that's no place for you.
[04:37:19.020 --> 04:37:20.780]   You're eight summers old."
[04:37:20.780 --> 04:37:25.540]   "War's here too," she said, looking at her feet.
[04:37:25.540 --> 04:37:28.420]   "What do you call what happened to my village?
[04:37:28.420 --> 04:37:29.420]   My mum."
[04:37:29.420 --> 04:37:32.860]   There was a tremor in her voice now.
[04:37:32.860 --> 04:37:35.540]   He reached out and squeezed her hand.
[04:37:35.540 --> 04:37:37.820]   She sucked in a deep breath, stuck her lip out.
[04:37:37.820 --> 04:37:40.620]   "I've thought about it already," she said.
[04:37:40.620 --> 04:37:42.740]   "Bad things happen everywhere.
[04:37:42.740 --> 04:37:47.340]   My village didn't go marching off to war, but war still came and found them.
[04:37:47.340 --> 04:37:50.940]   You can leave me here, but who's to say 'Mork Ants'?"
[04:37:50.940 --> 04:37:55.060]   She paused at his name, her sharp featured face twisting with hatred.
[04:37:55.060 --> 04:37:58.380]   "Who's to say the same thing won't happen again?
[04:37:58.380 --> 04:38:01.140]   Warband's out there."
[04:38:01.140 --> 04:38:04.540]   She waved angry at the marshes, staring at him defiantly.
[04:38:04.540 --> 04:38:07.900]   "And you just leave me here and walk away?"
[04:38:07.900 --> 04:38:11.140]   "Well, didn't expect that."
[04:38:11.140 --> 04:38:16.940]   "Asphroth toals, but that's the most words you've put together since I met you," Kamlyn
[04:38:16.940 --> 04:38:19.380]   said, blowing out a long breath.
[04:38:19.380 --> 04:38:26.220]   "I like it here," she added, suddenly vulnerable, a child again, "and besides, try and leave
[04:38:26.220 --> 04:38:29.500]   me here, or anywhere, I'll just give 'em the slip and follow you.
[04:38:29.500 --> 04:38:31.060]   Done it before."
[04:38:31.060 --> 04:38:33.780]   She grinned mischievously.
[04:38:33.780 --> 04:38:34.780]   Kamlyn sighed.
[04:38:34.780 --> 04:38:39.060]   "Looks like you've thought it all through," she nodded.
[04:38:39.060 --> 04:38:43.700]   "Well, seems that's settled then."
[04:38:43.700 --> 04:38:48.340]   She gave him a long look, suspicious at first, which slowly changed to something resembling
[04:38:48.340 --> 04:38:52.660]   pleased, and she went back to eating her squirrel.
[04:38:52.660 --> 04:38:57.700]   He looked back to the tower, saw a black smudge swirl around the cloud of smoke and come flapping
[04:38:57.700 --> 04:38:59.340]   up the hill towards them.
[04:38:59.340 --> 04:39:02.380]   "Is that Kraft?"
[04:39:02.380 --> 04:39:07.020]   He felt a little jolt of relief and realised he'd been worried about the old crow.
[04:39:07.020 --> 04:39:11.700]   The crow saw him and spiralled down, starting cooing as it drew close and alighted upon
[04:39:11.700 --> 04:39:13.660]   a branch over his head.
[04:39:13.660 --> 04:39:14.660]   "Kraff?
[04:39:14.660 --> 04:39:15.660]   Hungry?"
[04:39:15.660 --> 04:39:21.020]   It squawked, beady-eyed, staring at the pile of skin, bone and offal that had been a squirrel
[04:39:21.020 --> 04:39:22.620]   a short while ago.
[04:39:22.620 --> 04:39:25.980]   "Help yourself," Kamlyn said with a wave of his hand.
[04:39:25.980 --> 04:39:30.460]   "Didn't think you usually asked," he added.
[04:39:30.460 --> 04:39:34.500]   When the crow had done, it hopped closer to Kamlyn.
[04:39:34.500 --> 04:39:35.500]   "Well?"
[04:39:35.500 --> 04:39:39.100]   Kamlyn asked, eager to hear the bird's news.
[04:39:39.100 --> 04:39:40.100]   "Idana?"
[04:39:40.100 --> 04:39:41.100]   Kraft squawked.
[04:39:41.100 --> 04:39:47.340]   "Aye, you're right," Kamlyn said, groaning at his stiff back as he stood.
[04:39:47.340 --> 04:39:49.860]   "Better off saying a news once.
[04:39:49.860 --> 04:39:52.580]   She's over there."
[04:39:52.580 --> 04:39:56.380]   Kamlyn strode through white-spaced woodland towards Idana.
[04:39:56.380 --> 04:40:01.260]   She had fewer about her now, just Halion, Von and Baird.
[04:40:01.260 --> 04:40:04.660]   Nothing of her earlier emotion showed on her face.
[04:40:04.660 --> 04:40:07.580]   She just looks tired, Kamlyn thought.
[04:40:07.580 --> 04:40:13.260]   "Kraff's back," Kamlyn announced, and the crow fluttered down onto the log Idana was
[04:40:13.260 --> 04:40:14.260]   sitting on.
[04:40:14.260 --> 04:40:17.740]   "You're right," Kamlyn asked Idana.
[04:40:17.740 --> 04:40:24.260]   "My queen," he added, "after, earlier, the prisoners."
[04:40:24.260 --> 04:40:26.620]   She passed a hand over her eyes and sighed.
[04:40:26.620 --> 04:40:28.980]   "So much death," she said.
[04:40:28.980 --> 04:40:31.140]   "Would there ever be an end to it?"
[04:40:31.140 --> 04:40:34.700]   "Gotta believe there will be," Kamlyn shrugged.
[04:40:34.700 --> 04:40:38.100]   "Call's hope have been told."
[04:40:38.100 --> 04:40:39.540]   He gave a lopsided grin.
[04:40:39.540 --> 04:40:45.040]   "Long as it doesn't end with ours, death, that is."
[04:40:45.040 --> 04:40:47.620]   She smiled at that, a little snort of laughter.
[04:40:47.620 --> 04:40:52.180]   "How many stays?" he asked, referring to the prisoners.
[04:40:52.180 --> 04:40:55.500]   "Twenty-eight," Halion said.
[04:40:55.500 --> 04:40:56.500]   Kamlyn nodded.
[04:40:56.500 --> 04:40:58.000]   "Shost them?"
[04:40:58.000 --> 04:41:00.860]   "Not really," Idana admitted.
[04:41:00.860 --> 04:41:05.380]   "But if I'm going to raise a warband, more than half the men of Arden are probably wearing
[04:41:05.380 --> 04:41:07.740]   Ryn's colors right now.
[04:41:07.740 --> 04:41:11.020]   I have to believe that it's against their will that they'd rather fight for me."
[04:41:11.020 --> 04:41:16.420]   "Think that's most likely true enough?
[04:41:16.420 --> 04:41:18.660]   Always some rotten apples in the battle, though."
[04:41:18.660 --> 04:41:22.940]   "I know," Idana said, "but how do we root them out?"
[04:41:22.940 --> 04:41:23.940]   "New recruits.
[04:41:23.940 --> 04:41:28.080]   Put 'em at the front of the first battle and the second.
[04:41:28.080 --> 04:41:31.380]   They'd improve themselves, risk dying for you.
[04:41:31.380 --> 04:41:35.700]   The baddens will most likely run first chance they get."
[04:41:35.700 --> 04:41:39.380]   Baird grunted approvingly, and Idana nodded thoughtfully at that.
[04:41:39.380 --> 04:41:41.220]   "I'll do that," she said.
[04:41:41.220 --> 04:41:44.300]   "Now, Kraff, what news have you for us?"
[04:41:44.300 --> 04:41:45.300]   "Ryn?
[04:41:45.300 --> 04:41:46.940]   At Dunk Ryn?"
[04:41:46.940 --> 04:41:48.020]   Kraff said.
[04:41:48.020 --> 04:41:51.940]   He paused and looked at them all, "Very angry!"
[04:41:51.940 --> 04:41:52.940]   Baird laughed at that.
[04:41:52.940 --> 04:41:53.940]   "How many?"
[04:41:53.940 --> 04:41:55.180]   Halion asked.
[04:41:55.180 --> 04:41:56.380]   "Lots?"
[04:41:56.380 --> 04:41:57.380]   Kraff muttered.
[04:41:57.380 --> 04:41:58.380]   "Thousand?
[04:41:58.380 --> 04:41:59.380]   Ten thousand?
[04:41:59.380 --> 04:42:00.380]   And giants?
[04:42:00.380 --> 04:42:02.660]   From Muryas?"
[04:42:02.660 --> 04:42:03.940]   Kamlyn raised his eyebrows.
[04:42:03.940 --> 04:42:07.980]   "That explains the strange tracks in the meadow near Morgant's Tower."
[04:42:07.980 --> 04:42:09.980]   "Godwar?"
[04:42:09.980 --> 04:42:12.940]   Kraff muttered, ruffling feathers with his beak.
[04:42:12.940 --> 04:42:15.420]   "That again."
[04:42:15.420 --> 04:42:17.220]   Von tense that Kraff's words.
[04:42:17.220 --> 04:42:22.060]   "It must be taken seriously," Von said.
[04:42:22.060 --> 04:42:27.020]   Von had already spoken to Idana and Kamlyn about this God-war, told them about how he
[04:42:27.020 --> 04:42:31.780]   had stolen the giant's book from his father, Evanus, which had, in turn, been taken from
[04:42:31.780 --> 04:42:35.820]   him by Brynner during their flight to Doan.
[04:42:35.820 --> 04:42:38.580]   Then, and Idana had witnessed this.
[04:42:38.580 --> 04:42:43.760]   But Von also told them of a necklace hidden in Evanus's tower at Dunkarrig, a necklace
[04:42:43.760 --> 04:42:46.380]   with a black stone as a pendant.
[04:42:46.380 --> 04:42:49.980]   "Ask Kraff what the seven treasures are," Von had said.
[04:42:49.980 --> 04:42:52.700]   "I don't need to ask Kraff," Idana had replied.
[04:42:52.700 --> 04:42:55.100]   "I know the old tales as well as any.
[04:42:55.100 --> 04:42:58.860]   Cauldron and cup, spear, axe and dagger, talk and necklace."
[04:42:58.860 --> 04:43:02.740]   "Aye, necklace," Von had said.
[04:43:02.740 --> 04:43:04.420]   "It makes sense.
[04:43:04.420 --> 04:43:07.740]   Dunkarrig, fortress of the Menothi, nimman their queen."
[04:43:07.740 --> 04:43:12.140]   "So what if you're right?"
[04:43:12.140 --> 04:43:13.140]   Kamlyn had asked.
[04:43:13.140 --> 04:43:18.820]   "If one of the seven treasures is in Dunkarrig, then we must do something about it.
[04:43:18.820 --> 04:43:22.640]   Kraff keeps squawking about the God-war, a prophecy about Corbin and the bright star
[04:43:22.640 --> 04:43:24.820]   and black sun, about the seven treasures."
[04:43:24.820 --> 04:43:30.020]   "It all sounds right, strange to me," Kamlyn had said.
[04:43:30.020 --> 04:43:32.500]   "Aye, me too," Von had agreed.
[04:43:32.500 --> 04:43:34.660]   "But you're not understanding.
[04:43:34.660 --> 04:43:39.580]   If Kraff is right, if this God-war is happening, then what is happening here in Arden is just
[04:43:39.580 --> 04:43:42.040]   a pebble in the ocean.
[04:43:42.040 --> 04:43:44.420]   If this is true, then we must help."
[04:43:44.420 --> 04:43:47.060]   "How would we help?"
[04:43:47.060 --> 04:43:48.060]   Idana had asked.
[04:43:48.060 --> 04:43:53.260]   "We must go and get the necklace and take it to Corbin in Drassil."
[04:43:53.260 --> 04:43:55.300]   Idana had just stared at Von.
[04:43:55.300 --> 04:43:57.980]   Kamlyn hadn't been sure if she thought he was mad.
[04:43:57.980 --> 04:44:02.860]   "I'll think on it." was all that she had said, and then left.
[04:44:02.860 --> 04:44:07.380]   "I am taking it seriously," Idana said to Von.
[04:44:07.380 --> 04:44:11.020]   "Then what will be done about it, the God-war, the necklace?"
[04:44:11.020 --> 04:44:12.020]   Von pressed.
[04:44:12.020 --> 04:44:19.580]   "I am going to retake Arden," Idana said slowly, "or die in the trying.
[04:44:19.580 --> 04:44:25.980]   If by some stroke of good fortune I am victorious and Ryn is slain or sent back to Cambran,
[04:44:25.980 --> 04:44:32.340]   then I will gladly tear Ebness's tower down, stone by stone, until this necklace is found
[04:44:32.340 --> 04:44:35.900]   and I will personally take it to Corbin in Drassil.
[04:44:35.900 --> 04:44:41.780]   But until then, I must concentrate on what is in front of me, Arden and Ryn first."
[04:44:41.780 --> 04:44:43.140]   "Wrong!"
[04:44:43.140 --> 04:44:44.140]   Kraff said.
[04:44:44.140 --> 04:44:46.340]   "I like that bird."
[04:44:46.340 --> 04:44:47.340]   Bear chuckled.
[04:44:47.340 --> 04:44:48.340]   "He's got stones.
[04:44:48.340 --> 04:44:49.340]   Speaks his mind."
[04:44:49.340 --> 04:44:55.420]   "Well, a good counsellor does, I suppose," Idana said, "but they also know when to stop
[04:44:55.420 --> 04:44:59.100]   and not labour a point," she added, with one eyebrow raised.
[04:44:59.100 --> 04:45:03.460]   "I have listened, weighed the choices, and I have made my decision.
[04:45:03.460 --> 04:45:11.700]   But," Von began, "no," Idana said, her voice rising, "enough, Von."
[04:45:11.700 --> 04:45:16.460]   Von scowled at her a long moment, jaw working as he struggled with the words itching to
[04:45:16.460 --> 04:45:18.180]   get out of his mouth.
[04:45:18.180 --> 04:45:25.020]   Then he clamped his jaw shut and nodded.
[04:45:25.020 --> 04:45:30.520]   Number 21, Halen.
[04:45:30.520 --> 04:45:34.700]   Halen stared at Corbin as moonlight silvered her face.
[04:45:34.700 --> 04:45:39.060]   He was terrified being out as he had grown so accustomed to hiding, but Budai had been
[04:45:39.060 --> 04:45:43.300]   uncontrollable after he got a sniff of pots, snapping his leash and heading off into the
[04:45:43.300 --> 04:45:47.260]   darkness, and pots had run with him.
[04:45:47.260 --> 04:45:52.260]   For one elongated moment, Halen had watched them go, then he had been scrambling after
[04:45:52.260 --> 04:45:56.340]   them, cursing them both the entire time it had taken him to catch up with Budai and wrap
[04:45:56.340 --> 04:46:00.260]   the remains of the torn leash about his arm.
[04:46:00.260 --> 04:46:04.000]   Budai had calmed for a while when they reached his courtyard.
[04:46:04.000 --> 04:46:08.620]   Maybe the sounds of guardsmen and the crackling fire reminded him that death lurked around
[04:46:08.620 --> 04:46:11.460]   every corner in this place.
[04:46:11.460 --> 04:46:15.420]   That was until the figure had appeared at the window.
[04:46:15.420 --> 04:46:19.620]   Budai had taken a few deep sniffs through his broad muzzle, whined, and then he was off
[04:46:19.620 --> 04:46:21.140]   again.
[04:46:21.140 --> 04:46:25.380]   One standing no chance of even slowing him, let alone stopping him.
[04:46:25.380 --> 04:46:28.620]   "Halen, what are you doing here?"
[04:46:28.620 --> 04:46:29.620]   Cohen whispered.
[04:46:29.620 --> 04:46:35.940]   "Chasing the dogs," he whispered back, eyes flitting between Cohen and the firelight flickering
[04:46:35.940 --> 04:46:38.780]   at the building's corner.
[04:46:38.780 --> 04:46:42.100]   Cohen smiled, ruffling Budai's fur.
[04:46:42.100 --> 04:46:45.240]   "I mean, how are you still alive?
[04:46:45.240 --> 04:46:46.740]   Where are you hiding?
[04:46:46.740 --> 04:46:47.740]   Are you alone?
[04:46:47.740 --> 04:46:51.040]   How do you have Budai with you?"
[04:46:51.040 --> 04:46:53.140]   She took a breath, clearly framing more questions.
[04:46:53.140 --> 04:46:55.820]   "It's not safe here," Halen said.
[04:46:55.820 --> 04:46:57.660]   "Come with me."
[04:46:57.660 --> 04:46:59.740]   He went to move away, but Cohen gripped his wrist.
[04:46:59.740 --> 04:47:03.680]   "I'll tell you everything, I promise," he said.
[04:47:03.680 --> 04:47:08.700]   He looked up, the open sky, moon, and stars feeling like it went on forever.
[04:47:08.700 --> 04:47:10.600]   He shudder.
[04:47:10.600 --> 04:47:12.100]   Cohen stared at him and nodded.
[04:47:12.100 --> 04:47:16.180]   "Follow me," he whispered, and ran.
[04:47:16.180 --> 04:47:21.620]   They passed through wide streets, always keeping to the edges, to the shadows.
[04:47:21.620 --> 04:47:25.420]   Soon they were entering a courtyard with an old oak at its centre, its trunk wide and
[04:47:25.420 --> 04:47:29.820]   thick, roots churning up the flag-stoned floor.
[04:47:29.820 --> 04:47:34.820]   Halen headed to a deeper shadow in its midst, and then he was scrambling into it.
[04:47:34.820 --> 04:47:39.280]   Climbing into the hole that led to his den, his sense of safety grew palpably with each
[04:47:39.280 --> 04:47:42.940]   step deeper into his underground hiding place.
[04:47:42.940 --> 04:47:49.100]   "This way," Halen whispered, as they slithered down a slope about the length of a man and
[04:47:49.100 --> 04:47:52.660]   reached the spot where you could turn left or right.
[04:47:52.660 --> 04:47:58.220]   The familiar stench from the left drifted up to him, but by now Halen hardly noticed.
[04:47:58.220 --> 04:48:02.860]   Cohen clearly did, though, wrinkling her nose and then putting a hand over her mouth.
[04:48:02.860 --> 04:48:06.580]   "That's disgusting," she whispered.
[04:48:06.580 --> 04:48:08.500]   Halen grunted and turned right.
[04:48:08.500 --> 04:48:13.700]   They shuffled along a dark, narrowing space, forced onto hands and knees, as the tunnel
[04:48:13.700 --> 04:48:19.020]   they were in followed a twisting root, then Halen heard a welcoming whine and saw a flicker
[04:48:19.020 --> 04:48:20.300]   of light.
[04:48:20.300 --> 04:48:22.180]   He smiled.
[04:48:22.180 --> 04:48:26.820]   A space opened up before him, wide enough for about six men to stand abreast, and about
[04:48:26.820 --> 04:48:29.540]   a dozen paces long.
[04:48:29.540 --> 04:48:35.780]   Beyond that, the tunnel narrowed again, twisting off about the root it followed.
[04:48:35.780 --> 04:48:40.780]   The small chamber was lit by a bowl of oil on a knot in a thick root, flame dancing upon
[04:48:40.780 --> 04:48:43.380]   its surface.
[04:48:43.380 --> 04:48:49.100]   Two faces greeted him, swain and sif, wolf's son and daughter, and six bundles of fur,
[04:48:49.100 --> 04:48:54.780]   boot-eyes and storm's cubs bouncing and leaping in their excitement at his return.
[04:48:54.780 --> 04:48:58.500]   Seeing them like this, he realised how they'd grown.
[04:48:58.500 --> 04:49:03.340]   They were only five or six moons old, but already they were all taller than pots, their
[04:49:03.340 --> 04:49:06.780]   necks and broad chests thickening with muscle.
[04:49:06.780 --> 04:49:07.780]   Like boot-eye.
[04:49:07.780 --> 04:49:13.820]   They'll not grow as big a storm, but big enough, and they'll be wide and strong, I don't doubt.
[04:49:13.820 --> 04:49:19.020]   "Calm down," sif scolded the cubs as they bounced into her.
[04:49:19.020 --> 04:49:22.820]   She was on her hands and knees, playing with her bag of stones and nuts, rolling them into
[04:49:22.820 --> 04:49:24.660]   each other.
[04:49:24.660 --> 04:49:27.220]   Some of them sifachalked white.
[04:49:27.220 --> 04:49:32.100]   I still don't understand that game, but it's kept sif quiet for over a moon.
[04:49:32.100 --> 04:49:37.020]   Giant pots burst into the chamber, making the cubs even more excited.
[04:49:37.020 --> 04:49:42.540]   One of them froze, black-faced and brindle-coated, and stared at the darkness of the tunnel.
[04:49:42.540 --> 04:49:46.900]   It growled, revealing a row of razor-sharp puppy teeth.
[04:49:46.900 --> 04:49:53.940]   "Shadow," Halen said, reaching out her hand to the cub, but she didn't stop growling.
[04:49:53.940 --> 04:49:58.100]   The other cubs stopped their frolicking and stared, too, cocking heads, and then they
[04:49:58.100 --> 04:50:01.380]   were all growling as Cohen emerged from the darkness.
[04:50:01.380 --> 04:50:07.820]   "Shadow," the black-faced cub, took a snarling step forwards, legs bunching about to leap,
[04:50:07.820 --> 04:50:12.420]   the others moving tight about her, all growling hackles up.
[04:50:12.420 --> 04:50:18.700]   Halen felt a real moment of panic, snapping a command at them that was completely ignored.
[04:50:18.700 --> 04:50:24.420]   Then Budai was standing between the cubs and Cohen, baring his teeth, daring them.
[04:50:24.420 --> 04:50:29.580]   The cubs stopped, tails dropping, submitting.
[04:50:29.580 --> 04:50:33.620]   Shadow gave a last little growl of protest, and then she, too, was quiet.
[04:50:33.620 --> 04:50:34.620]   Thank Elion.
[04:50:34.620 --> 04:50:40.340]   "I thought they were going to attack me," Cohen said, looking relieved as she stroked
[04:50:40.340 --> 04:50:42.940]   Budai's broad head.
[04:50:42.940 --> 04:50:47.060]   Then she threw her head back and laughed, long and sounding slightly mad.
[04:50:47.060 --> 04:50:53.500]   "I can't believe you're all here," Cohen said, sitting down and cuddling Budai.
[04:50:53.500 --> 04:50:56.700]   Pots put his forelegs on Cohen's shoulder and licked one of her ears.
[04:50:56.700 --> 04:51:00.500]   The cubs tentatively approached her, sniffing.
[04:51:00.500 --> 04:51:04.460]   Cohen held her arms out and beckoned to Sif, who walked over and hesitantly allowed Cohen
[04:51:04.460 --> 04:51:06.940]   to hug her.
[04:51:06.940 --> 04:51:12.620]   After about a count of ten, Sif was sitting in Cohen's lap, hugging her tightly in return.
[04:51:12.620 --> 04:51:15.140]   "How's this happened?"
[04:51:15.140 --> 04:51:16.140]   Cohen asked.
[04:51:16.140 --> 04:51:19.100]   "The battle," Swain started.
[04:51:19.100 --> 04:51:22.700]   "When it happened, we were here with the cubs.
[04:51:22.700 --> 04:51:26.940]   As Corbin had asked us to look after them," Sif said with big serious eyes.
[04:51:26.940 --> 04:51:29.740]   "He did, I remember," Cohen agreed.
[04:51:29.740 --> 04:51:33.700]   "We didn't know what to do," Swain continued.
[04:51:33.700 --> 04:51:38.180]   I was terrified, Halem thought, remembering the distant din of battle, the screams and
[04:51:38.180 --> 04:51:40.420]   battle cries, flames, smoke.
[04:51:40.420 --> 04:51:44.540]   He'd been in the courtyard above, playing tug with Shadow.
[04:51:44.540 --> 04:51:49.020]   She'd heard it first, stopping and staring, ears going flat to her head.
[04:51:49.020 --> 04:51:54.580]   "Budai was here with the cubs," Swain continued, "but he ran off when the fighting started,
[04:51:54.580 --> 04:51:56.900]   and then all the cubs were off as well following him.
[04:51:56.900 --> 04:52:00.340]   We chased them, and then a man appeared in front of us."
[04:52:00.340 --> 04:52:04.860]   "He had rings in his beard," Sif said.
[04:52:04.860 --> 04:52:08.220]   "Aye," Swain said, eyes distant, remembering.
[04:52:08.220 --> 04:52:11.980]   "He was going to kill us, tried to, but Budai killed him.
[04:52:11.980 --> 04:52:16.340]   Ripped his throat out," Sif added, matter of factly.
[04:52:16.340 --> 04:52:21.060]   "We picked up all the cubs between us and tricked Budai into following us back here."
[04:52:21.060 --> 04:52:23.700]   "How did you manage that?"
[04:52:23.700 --> 04:52:25.020]   Cohen asked.
[04:52:25.020 --> 04:52:27.580]   They were silent a few moments.
[04:52:27.580 --> 04:52:33.420]   "I pinched one of the cubs, twisted her ear, and made her cry," Halem said.
[04:52:33.420 --> 04:52:35.140]   He still felt guilty about that.
[04:52:35.140 --> 04:52:38.660]   "Budai followed us back here, and then we tied him up.
[04:52:38.660 --> 04:52:41.820]   We were scared he'd get killed," Sif said.
[04:52:41.820 --> 04:52:46.300]   "You were right to do it," Cohen said, stroking Sif's hair.
[04:52:46.300 --> 04:52:48.380]   "Budai would have been killed."
[04:52:48.380 --> 04:52:54.380]   "I think you saved his life," Sif smiled at that, nodding.
[04:52:54.380 --> 04:52:59.500]   By now all six cubs were rubbing up against Cohen, sniffing, nibbling her clothing.
[04:52:59.500 --> 04:53:02.740]   One was tugging at her hair, and she absently pushed it off.
[04:53:02.740 --> 04:53:08.220]   "And since then," Swain went on, "we've just stayed hidden.
[04:53:08.220 --> 04:53:12.460]   Every now and then me or Halem sneak out for food and water.
[04:53:12.460 --> 04:53:15.700]   Pots is good at foraging for the cubs, he's always disappearing and coming back with something
[04:53:15.700 --> 04:53:17.820]   for them."
[04:53:17.820 --> 04:53:21.020]   Sif screwed her face up at that, and Halem remembered some of the things Pots had returned
[04:53:21.020 --> 04:53:22.020]   with.
[04:53:22.020 --> 04:53:23.900]   An arm, once.
[04:53:23.900 --> 04:53:25.860]   The cubs hadn't complained.
[04:53:25.860 --> 04:53:27.580]   "What's happening?"
[04:53:27.580 --> 04:53:30.500]   "Up there," Swain asked Cohen.
[04:53:30.500 --> 04:53:33.180]   "I'm a prisoner," Cohen said.
[04:53:33.180 --> 04:53:37.180]   "I tend to the sick, wounded from the battle.
[04:53:37.180 --> 04:53:41.420]   Most have recovered or died, but there are still a few to tend to."
[04:53:41.420 --> 04:53:46.260]   "I meant Corbin," Swain said. "And Dar?
[04:53:46.260 --> 04:53:47.260]   Wolf?
[04:53:47.260 --> 04:53:52.860]   I think he escaped," Cohen said, and Swain and Sif physically drooped with relief.
[04:53:52.860 --> 04:53:53.860]   "Tahir.
[04:53:53.860 --> 04:53:57.620]   What are my shieldmen and my friend?"
[04:53:57.620 --> 04:54:02.300]   Tahir had driven Halem mad with his strict rules about where Halem could and couldn't
[04:54:02.300 --> 04:54:06.820]   go, what he could and couldn't do, and his mam's old sayings.
[04:54:06.820 --> 04:54:09.900]   "I wish I could see him and hear one of those sayings now."
[04:54:10.900 --> 04:54:13.540]   "Tahir?" he asked.
[04:54:13.540 --> 04:54:17.260]   "You're a shieldman, I don't know," Cohen shrugged.
[04:54:17.260 --> 04:54:19.780]   "There was a lot of confusion.
[04:54:19.780 --> 04:54:23.660]   Many escaped," she said hopefully, "and they're in foreign, still fighting."
[04:54:23.660 --> 04:54:28.820]   "How do you know if you're a prisoner?"
[04:54:28.820 --> 04:54:30.780]   Halem asked suspiciously.
[04:54:30.780 --> 04:54:34.820]   He wanted good news, but he didn't want to be lied to, treated like a child.
[04:54:34.820 --> 04:54:37.780]   "A patrol of Venthallen came back this morning.
[04:54:37.780 --> 04:54:38.780]   I saw them.
[04:54:38.780 --> 04:54:41.860]   They were more dead and wounded than the living amongst them."
[04:54:41.860 --> 04:54:44.340]   "Huh," Swain barked a laugh.
[04:54:44.340 --> 04:54:48.260]   "My daars work for sure, no doubt," Cohen said.
[04:54:48.260 --> 04:54:51.020]   "So what now?"
[04:54:51.020 --> 04:54:52.020]   Halem asked.
[04:54:52.020 --> 04:54:54.140]   "You could stay with us," Sif said.
[04:54:54.140 --> 04:54:57.900]   "I wish I could," Cohen replied, "but I can't.
[04:54:57.900 --> 04:55:00.940]   I tend to sick and cannot abandon them.
[04:55:00.940 --> 04:55:06.420]   Besides, if Khaled has found me gone, he'd tear Drassle apart looking for me.
[04:55:06.420 --> 04:55:08.620]   He might find you.
[04:55:08.620 --> 04:55:10.260]   Why would he do that?"
[04:55:10.260 --> 04:55:11.260]   Sif asked.
[04:55:11.260 --> 04:55:16.420]   "Because I am Corbin's kin, and he thinks Corbin will come for me.
[04:55:16.420 --> 04:55:18.700]   I am bait in a trap."
[04:55:18.700 --> 04:55:21.460]   "Will Corbin come?"
[04:55:21.460 --> 04:55:23.140]   Halem, Swain, and Sif asked together.
[04:55:23.140 --> 04:55:26.460]   "I don't know," Cohen shook her head.
[04:55:26.460 --> 04:55:30.860]   "He did the last time, when I was Khaledis' prisoner.
[04:55:30.860 --> 04:55:36.140]   But if it's a trap," Halem said, "then Corbin cannot come.
[04:55:36.140 --> 04:55:39.100]   He is our hope."
[04:55:39.100 --> 04:55:44.580]   Halem loved Corbin, admired him as the greatest warrior and leader the world had ever seen.
[04:55:44.580 --> 04:55:47.060]   "Then you have to escape.
[04:55:47.060 --> 04:55:50.620]   Get out of here before Corbin comes for you."
[04:55:50.620 --> 04:55:55.220]   A smile twitched Cohen's mouth, not light-hearted but serious and determined.
[04:55:55.220 --> 04:56:00.740]   "My thought exactly," she said, "is just the how that I'm struggling with.
[04:56:00.740 --> 04:56:06.020]   And now that I know you're here," she smiled, "you'll have to come with me, as Khaledis
[04:56:06.020 --> 04:56:08.980]   may find you in his search for me."
[04:56:08.980 --> 04:56:12.500]   That thought both excited and scared Halem.
[04:56:12.500 --> 04:56:17.020]   To be away from this danger, the daily fear of being discovered in court, but being away
[04:56:17.020 --> 04:56:22.260]   from our den which has kept us safe and hidden the whole moon.
[04:56:22.260 --> 04:56:27.260]   And talking of being discovered, I should go back to the hospice, as the sun will be
[04:56:27.260 --> 04:56:29.620]   rising.
[04:56:29.620 --> 04:56:33.820]   Sif squeezed her harder, and Cohen squeezed her in return.
[04:56:33.820 --> 04:56:39.780]   "I cannot tell you how happy I am to know that you're alive and here," Cohen said, "and
[04:56:39.780 --> 04:56:41.660]   my Budai."
[04:56:41.660 --> 04:56:43.780]   She hugged the hound's neck, kissing him.
[04:56:43.780 --> 04:56:49.700]   "I'll return soon," she said, then made her goodbyes, ruffling the cub's heads and hugging
[04:56:49.700 --> 04:56:51.680]   Sif again.
[04:56:51.680 --> 04:56:57.260]   She gave Budai a stern order to stay and then backed into the darkness of the tunnel.
[04:56:57.260 --> 04:57:00.980]   Budai whined, but he did not follow her.
[04:57:00.980 --> 04:57:05.740]   Cohen did, though, and soon they were at the slope that led up to the courtyard.
[04:57:05.740 --> 04:57:07.620]   Moonlight showed them the way.
[04:57:07.620 --> 04:57:13.300]   "That smell," Cohen said, wrinkling her nose as they stood in the darkness at the base
[04:57:13.300 --> 04:57:15.200]   of the slope.
[04:57:15.200 --> 04:57:18.620]   She was staring into the darkness of the tunnel where the smell was drifting from.
[04:57:18.620 --> 04:57:24.220]   "I recognize it," she said quietly, her expression changing.
[04:57:24.220 --> 04:57:25.220]   She looked scared.
[04:57:25.220 --> 04:57:28.300]   "Is that another tunnel?" she asked him.
[04:57:28.300 --> 04:57:33.420]   "It is," he said, remembering the first time he'd found this place, how he'd crawled that
[04:57:33.420 --> 04:57:36.300]   way first, eventually stopping and coming back.
[04:57:36.300 --> 04:57:39.300]   "It gets too narrow."
[04:57:39.300 --> 04:57:41.500]   Strangely the cubs never went that way.
[04:57:41.500 --> 04:57:45.900]   "Good," Cohen said, her expression relaxing.
[04:57:45.900 --> 04:57:46.900]   "Why?"
[04:57:46.900 --> 04:57:56.340]   "Because I know that smell and I think there are dregs down there."
[04:57:56.340 --> 04:58:01.740]   Chapter 22 Corbin
[04:58:01.740 --> 04:58:06.740]   Corbin sat upon a giant bear, hands gripping the high pommel of a saddle as it shambled
[04:58:06.740 --> 04:58:13.020]   along a fresh-built road that cut like a spear through the trees and undergrowth of fawn.
[04:58:13.020 --> 04:58:16.580]   Jail's road, which he built almost from the boundaries of Graham's Hold to see him and
[04:58:16.580 --> 04:58:20.180]   his warband to the walls of Drassil.
[04:58:20.180 --> 04:58:25.180]   The bear's pace was surprisingly fast, eating up the leagues at a relentless pace throughout
[04:58:25.180 --> 04:58:27.660]   each day's travel.
[04:58:27.660 --> 04:58:32.060]   His legs were aching, the girth of a bear was unsuitable for his human legs.
[04:58:32.060 --> 04:58:37.540]   "I miss shield," he thought, "not for the first time."
[04:58:37.540 --> 04:58:42.460]   The trees were thinning now, the terrain changing and more sunlight breaking through the canopy
[04:58:42.460 --> 04:58:43.460]   above.
[04:58:43.460 --> 04:58:48.980]   There was less vine and thorn on the ground, more grass and wildflowers.
[04:58:48.980 --> 04:58:55.100]   And then Corbin saw the stumps of trees, a whole vale harvested of timber.
[04:58:55.100 --> 04:58:58.380]   We are close to Graham's Hold.
[04:58:58.380 --> 04:59:03.340]   With every league that he had travelled, every day that had passed, he had felt his spirit
[04:59:03.340 --> 04:59:05.340]   sink.
[04:59:05.340 --> 04:59:11.180]   After Michael's revelation about the prophecy, Corbin had been in the deepest depths of despair,
[04:59:11.180 --> 04:59:15.140]   but focusing on the hope of being reunited with Cohen and his friends had given him the
[04:59:15.140 --> 04:59:17.820]   strength to endure.
[04:59:17.820 --> 04:59:21.780]   It had been something to live for, to fight for.
[04:59:21.780 --> 04:59:26.500]   Now he knew that, with every breath that he drew, he was being taken further away from
[04:59:26.500 --> 04:59:31.940]   them, if they still lived, and despondency had morphed into anger.
[04:59:31.940 --> 04:59:34.500]   Hated faces appeared in his mind.
[04:59:34.500 --> 04:59:41.060]   Calydus, Nathair, Ildair, Rin, Michael.
[04:59:41.060 --> 04:59:45.700]   He had thought about escape, but the simple truth was that even if he could somehow break
[04:59:45.700 --> 04:59:50.060]   his bonds and slip away from his giant captors, he would not have been able to walk half a
[04:59:50.060 --> 04:59:52.940]   league because of his injuries.
[04:59:52.940 --> 04:59:58.380]   Even now, over a moon from when he'd been captured, they were still not fully recovered.
[04:59:58.380 --> 05:00:02.100]   Soon, though, perhaps.

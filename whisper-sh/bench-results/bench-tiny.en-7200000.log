[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840]   This is audible. Harper Collins presents The Hobbit, or there and back again by J.R.R. Tolkien,
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.000]   read by Andy Serkis.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.720]   Chapter 1 - An Unexpected Party
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:28.880]   In a hole, in the ground, they lived a Hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole filled with the
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.600]   ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.840]   down on or to eat. It was a Hobbit hole, and that means comfort. It had a perfectly round
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.520]   door like a porthole painted green with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.360]   The door opened onto a tube shaped hole like a tunnel, a very comfortable tunnel without smoke
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:02.160]   with panel walls and floors, tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs and lots and lots
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:10.000]   of pegs for hats and coats. The Hobbit was fun to visit us. The tunnel wound on and on going fairly,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.880]   but not quite straight into the side of the hill. The hill, as all the people for many miles
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.800]   round called it, and many little round doors opened out of it first on one side and then on another.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.760]   No going upstairs for the Hobbit, bedrooms, bathrooms, sellers, pantries, lots of these,
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:35.680]   wardrobes, he had whole rooms devoted to clothes, kitchens, dining rooms, all were on the same floor
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.840]   and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left hand side going in,
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.680]   for these were the only ones to have windows, deep set round windows looking over his garden and
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:56.320]   meadows beyond, sloping down to the river. This Hobbit was a very well-to-do Hobbit,
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.440]   and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses had lived in the neighborhood of the hill for
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.080]   time out of mind and people considered them very respectable. Not only because most of them were
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.760]   rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.120]   You could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:30.240]   This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure and found himself doing and saying things
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.360]   altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbor's respect, but he gained, well, you will see
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.600]   whether he gained anything in the end. The mother of our particular Hobbit,
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.360]   What is a Hobbit? I suppose Hobbits need some description nowadays since they have become rare and shy
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.880]   of the big people as they call us. They are, or were, a little people about half a height and smaller
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.760]   than the bearded dwarfs. Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no magic about them except the
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.640]   ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.440]   like you and me come blundering along making a noise like elephants that they can hear a mile off.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.920]   They are inclined to be fat in the stomach. They dress in bright colours chiefly green and yellow,
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:27.120]   where no shoes because their feet grow natural leathery souls and thick warm brown hair like
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:34.400]   the stuff on their heads, which is curly. Have long, clever brown fingers, good-natured faces,
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.720]   and laugh deep fruity laughs, especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.920]   get it. Now you know enough to go on with. As I was saying, the mother of this Hobbit,
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.480]   Bilbo Baggins, that is, was the famous Bella Donut Took, one of the three remarkable daughters of
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.320]   the Old Took, head of the Hobbits who lived across the water, the small river that ran at the foot of
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:07.840]   the hill. It was often said in other families that, long ago, one of the Took ancestors must have taken
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.920]   a very wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still something not entirely
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.880]   Hobbit like about them. And once in a while, members of the Took clan would go and have adventures.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.880]   They discreetly disappeared and the family hushed it up, but the fact remained that the Took's
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:34.000]   were not as respectable as the Bagginses, though they were undoubtedly richer. Not that Bella Donut Took
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.080]   ever had any adventures after she became Mrs. Bungo Baggins. Bungo, that was Bilbo's father,
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.760]   built the most luxurious Hobbit hole for her, and partly with her money. That was to be found
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:52.080]   either under the hill or over the hill or across the water, and there they remain to the end
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:05:00.160]   of their days. Still, it is probable that Bilbo, her only son, Loki looked and behaved exactly like
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.760]   a second edition of his solid and comfortable father, got something a bit queer in his makeup from the
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:14.800]   Took side, something that only waited for a chance to come out. The chance never arrived until Bilbo
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:22.000]   Baggins was grown up, being about 50 years old or so, and living in the beautiful Hobbit hole
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.880]   built by his father, which I've just described for you until he had in fact apparently settled down
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:37.280]   immovably. By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.400]   less noise and more green and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous and Bilbo Baggins
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.920]   was standing at his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached down
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:57.440]   nearly to his wooly toes neatly brushed. Gandalf came by. Gandalf. If you had heard only a
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.080]   quarter of what I have heard about him, and I've only heard very little of all there is to hear,
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:09.280]   you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale. Tales and adventures sprouted up all
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.920]   over the place wherever he went in the most extraordinary fashion. He had not been down that way
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.400]   under the hill for ages and ages not since his friend the all-took died, in fact, and the hobbits
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.400]   had almost forgotten what he looked like. He had been away over the hill and across the water on
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:36.000]   businesses of his own since they were all small hobbit boys and hobbit girls. All that the unsuspecting
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.040]   Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long gray
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:51.360]   cloak, a silver scarf over which his long white beard hung down below his waist and immense black
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:58.880]   boots. "Good morning," said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining and the grass was very green,
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:05.520]   but Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:14.160]   this shady hat. "What do you mean?" he said. "Do you wish me a good morning or mean that it is a good
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.080]   morning whether I wanted or not or that you feel good this morning or that it is a morning to be good
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:27.200]   on?" "All of them at once," said Bilbo, and a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.160]   into the bargain. "If you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a full of mine. There's no
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:38.480]   hurry we have all the day before us." Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:44.400]   and blew out a beautiful gray ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:51.840]   and floated away over the hill. "Very pretty," said Gandalf, "but I have no time to blow
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:58.480]   smoke rings this morning. I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:05.440]   and it's very difficult to find anyone." "I should think so in these parts, we are plain quiet
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:10.880]   folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things make you late for dinner.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:16.000]   I can't think what anybody sees in them," said I Mr. Baggins, and stuck one thumb behind his braces
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.720]   and blew out another even bigger smoke ring. Then he took out his morning letters and began
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:28.480]   to read, pretending to take no more notice of the old man. He had decided that he was not quite
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:36.080]   his sort and wanted him to go away. But the old man did not move. He stood leaning on his stick
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:42.480]   and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:50.320]   little cross. "Good morning," he said at last. "We don't want any adventures here, thank you.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:56.640]   You might try over the hill or across the water," by this he meant that the conversation was at an end.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:04.080]   "What a lot of things you do use good morning for," said Gandalf. "Now you mean you want to get rid
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:11.520]   of me and that it won't be good till I move off. Not at all, not at all that is, let me see. I don't
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:20.560]   think I know your name." "Yes, yes, my dear sir, and I do know your name Mr. Bilbo Baggins,
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:29.040]   and you do know my name, though you don't remember that I belonged to it. I am Gandalf,
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:35.120]   and Gandalf means me to think that I should have lived to be good morning by
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.480]   a bear-led-on-a-took sun as if I was selling buttons at the door."
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:45.600]   Gandalf, Gandalf, good gracious me, not the wandering wizard that gave old
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.840]   took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came undone until ordered,
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:55.040]   not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties about dragons and goblins and
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.480]   giants and the rescue of princesses and the unexpected lack of widow's sons, not the man that used
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:06.160]   to make particularly excellent fires go, I remember those, or toot you to have them on mid-summers
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.680]   Eve, splendid, they used to go up like great litties and stuck dragons and the burnings of fire
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:17.200]   and hang in the twilight all evening. You will notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:24.880]   so prosy as he liked to believe, also that he was very fond flowers. "Dear me," he went on,
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.160]   "not the Gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the blue
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:36.720]   who've had adventures, anything from climbing trees to visiting elves or sailing and ships sailing
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:42.800]   to other shores, bless me life used to be quite into…" I mean, you used to upset things badly
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:48.160]   in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no idea that you were still in business.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:55.920]   "Where else should I be?" said the wizard. "All the same, I am pleased to find you remember something
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:02.800]   about me. You seem to remember my fireworks kindly at any rate, and that is not without hope. Indeed,
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:10.400]   for your old grandfather took sake, and for the sake of poor Beladonna, I will give you what you
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:19.520]   asked for. I beg your pardon, I haven't asked for anything. Yes, you have. Twice now, my pardon,
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:28.400]   I give it to you. In fact, I will go so far as to send you to this adventure. Very amusing for me,
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:37.360]   very good for you, and profitable to very likely if you ever get over it. Sorry, I don't want any
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.480]   adventures. Thank you, not today. Good morning, but please come to tea anytime you like. Why not tomorrow?
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.360]   Come tomorrow. Goodbye." With that, the Hobbit turned and scuttled inside his round ring door and
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.960]   shut it as quickly as he dared, not to seem rude. Wizards, after all, are wizards.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:58.720]   What an earth did I ask him to tea for he said to himself as he went to the pantry.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.120]   He had only just had breakfast, but he thought a cake or two and a drink of something would
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:10.240]   do him good after his fright. Gandalf, in the meantime, was still standing outside the door
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:18.960]   and laughing long, but quietly. After a while, he stepped up and with the spike on his staff scratched
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:25.440]   a queer sign on the Hobbit's beautiful green front door. Then he strode away just about the time
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.920]   when Bilbo was finishing his second cake and beginning to think that he had escaped
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:38.960]   adventures very well. The next day, he'd almost forgotten about Gandalf. He did not remember things
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:45.120]   very well unless he put them down on his engagement tablet like this. Gandalf, tea Wednesday.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.520]   Yesterday, he had been too flustered to do anything of the kind.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:58.000]   Just before tea time, there came a tremendous ring on the front doorbell and then he remembered.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.200]   He rushed and put the kettle on and put out another cut and saucer and an extra cake or two
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:10.560]   and ran to the door. I am so sorry to keep you waiting, he was going to say when he saw that it was
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:19.520]   not Gandalf at all. It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt and very bright
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:25.600]   eyes under his dark green hood. As soon as the door was opened, he pushed inside just as if he had
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:33.440]   been expected. He hung his hoodied cloak on the nearest peg and "Warlen, at your service,"
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:40.400]   he said with a low bow. "Uh, Bilbo Baggins, at yours," said the Hobbit to surprise to ask any
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:46.000]   questions for the moment. When the silence that followed had become uncomfortable, he added,
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:54.400]   "I'm just about to take tea. The break come and have some with me. A little stiff that,
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:59.280]   but he meant it kindly." And what would you do if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:04.480]   things up in your hall without a word of explanation? They had not been at the table long. In fact,
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:10.480]   they had hardly reached the third cake when they came another, even louder ring at the bell.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:18.080]   Excuse me, he said the Hobbit and off he went to the door. So you have got here at last.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.480]   That's what he was going to say to Gandalf this time, but it was not Gandalf.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:30.400]   Instead, there was a very old looking dwarf on the step with a white beard and a scarlet hood,
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.800]   and he too hopped inside as soon as the doors opened just as if he'd been invited.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:41.840]   "See, they began to arrive already," he said when he caught sight of Diwarlen's green hood hanging up.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:49.840]   He hung his red one next to it and "Barlen, at your service," he said with his hand on his breast.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:58.080]   "Thank you," said Bilbo with a gasp. "It was not the correct thing to say, but they have begun to arrive
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:03.360]   had flustered him badly." He liked visitors, but he liked to know them before they arrived,
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.000]   and he preferred to ask them himself. He had a horrible thought that the cakes might run short
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.880]   and then he, as the host, he knew his duty and stuck to it however painful he might have to go
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:22.640]   without… couple of years and have some tea, he managed to say after taking a deep breath.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:28.080]   "A little beer would suit me better if it was all the same to Yuma good sir," said Bilbo with
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:33.120]   the white beard. "But I don't mind some cake, see cake if you have any."
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:39.520]   Lots, Bilbo found himself answering to his surprise, and he found himself scuttling off too
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:45.440]   to the cellar to fill a pint beer mug and then to a pantry to fetch two beautiful round
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:51.600]   sea cakes which he had baked that afternoon for his after supper morsel. "When he got back,
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:58.800]   Balen and Dwayne were talking at the table like old friends. As a matter of fact, they were brothers.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:04.480]   Bilbo plumped down the beer and the cake in front of them when loud came a ring at the bell
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:10.400]   again and then another ring. And Al for certain this time he thought as he puffed along the passage,
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:16.560]   but it was not. It was two more dwarves, both with blue hood silver belts and yellow beers and each
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:23.040]   of them carried a bag of tools and a spade. In they hopped as soon as the door began to open."
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:29.360]   Bilbo was hardly surprised at all. "What can I do for you, my dwarfs?" he said,
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:35.440]   "killy at your service," said the one, "and filly added the other and they both swept off their blue
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:42.560]   hoods and bowed at your horse and your families," replied Bilbo remembering his manners this time.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.920]   "Dwayne and Balen here already I see," said killy. "Let us join a throm."
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.720]   "Throm," I thought, "Mr. Bangings, I don't like the sound of that. I really must
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:59.120]   sit down for a minute and collect my wits and have a drink." He had only just had a sip in the corner
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:05.760]   while a four dwarf sat round the table and talked about mines and gold and troubles with the goblins
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.400]   and the depredations of dragons and lots of other things which he did not understand and did not
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:17.200]   want to for they sounded much too adventurous when ding dongling dang his bell rang again,
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.400]   as if some naughty little hobbit boy was trying to pull the handle off.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:28.000]   "Someone at the door," he said blinking. "It's some four, I should say by the sound," said Bilbo.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.880]   Besides we saw them coming along behind us in the distance, the poor little hobbit sat down in the
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.760]   hall and put his head in his hands and wondered what had happened and what was going to happen
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.240]   and whether they would all stay for supper."
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:47.600]   Then the bell rang again, loud enough that any had to run to the door it was not for
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:53.200]   after all it was five. Another dwarf had come along while he was wondering in the hall.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.440]   He had hardly turned the knot before they were all inside bowing and saying "get your service,"
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:04.480]   one after another. Dory norie, orie, owing and glowing were their names and very soon two purple
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:09.760]   hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood and a white hood were hanging on the pegs and off they marched
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:14.480]   with their broad hands stuck in their golden silver belts to join the others.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:22.720]   Already it had almost become a throng. Some called for ale, some for porter
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:28.240]   and one for coffee and all of them for cakes so the hobbit was kept very busy for a while.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:33.520]   A big jug of coffee had just been set in the hearth, the seed cakes were gone and the dwarves
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:40.800]   were starting on around a buttered scones when they came a loud knock. Not a ring, but a hard
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:49.200]   racket on the hobbit's beautiful green door. Somebody was banging with a stick. Bilbo rushed along
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:55.200]   the passage very angry and altogether bewildered and bewildered. This was the most awkward
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:00.400]   Wednesday he ever remembered. He pulled open the door with a jerk and they all fell in one
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:07.680]   on top of the other. More dwarfs, four more and there was Gandalf behind, leaning on his staff
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:15.440]   and laughing. He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door. He had also by the way knocked out the
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:22.240]   secret mark that he had put there the morning before. "Carefully, carefully!" he said. "It's not like
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:28.720]   you Bilbo to keep friends waiting on the mat and then open the door like a pop gun. Let me introduce
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:37.600]   before buffer bomber and especially Thorin." "At your service," said Biffer buffer and bomber,
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:43.760]   standing in a row. Then they hung up two yellow hoods and a pale green one and also a sky blue one
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:50.480]   with a long silver tassel. This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously important dwarf. In fact,
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:58.080]   no other than the great Thorin, Oconshield himself, who was not at all pleased at falling flat
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.160]   on Bilbo's mat with Biffer buffer and bomber on top of him. For one thing,
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:10.320]   Bomba was immensely fat and heavy. Thorin, indeed, was very haughty and said nothing about service,
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:17.040]   but Paul Mr. Baggins said he was sorry so many times that at last he grunted, "Pray, don't mention it,
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:25.040]   and stop frowning." "Now we are all here," said Gandalf, looking at the row of 13 hoods,
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:32.080]   the best detachable party hoods and his own hat hanging on the pegs. "Quite a merry gathering,
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:37.760]   I hope there is something left for the late comers to eat and drink. But what's that tea,
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:46.000]   oh no thank you, a little red wine?" "I think for me." "And for me," said Thorin. "And
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.440]   raspberry jam and apple tart," said Biffer, "it's poise and cheese," said Biffer.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:58.480]   Import by and salad," said Bumper. "But more cakes than I ill and coffee if you love mine,"
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.360]   called the other dwarves through the door. "Put on a few eggs, there's a good fellow,"
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:08.960]   Gandalf called after him as the hobbit stumped off to the pantries and just bring out the cold
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:14.800]   chicken and pickles. "Seems to know as much about the inside of my lard as I do myself," thought
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.280]   Mr. Baggins, who was feeling positively flummox and was beginning to wonder whether a
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:25.520]   most wretched adventure had not come right into his house. By the time he had got all the bottles and
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:31.040]   dishes and knives and forks and glasses and plates and spoons and things piled up on big trays,
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:39.280]   he was getting very hot and red in the face and annoyed. "Confosticate him, but bother these dwarves,"
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:46.320]   he said aloud. "Why don't they come and lend a hand?" Lo and behold, this stood balim and dwelling
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:50.640]   at the door of the kitchen and feely and killy behind them, and before he could say knife,
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:55.200]   they had whisked the trays and a couple of small tables into the parlor and set everything out of
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:04.160]   fresh." Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the 13 dwarves all round and Bilbo sat on a stool
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:10.320]   at the fireside nibbling at a biscuit. His appetite was quite taken away and trying to look as if
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:17.440]   this was all perfectly ordinary and not in the least an adventure. The dwarves ate and ate and
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:26.240]   talked and talked and time got on. At last they pushed their chairs back and Bilbo made a move
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:32.640]   to collect the plates and glasses. "I suppose you will all stay to supper," he said in his
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:40.720]   politest, unpressing tones. "Of course," said Thorin, "and after we shunt get through the business
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:46.480]   till late." And we must have some music first. "Now, to clear up."
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:52.240]   Thereupon the twelve dwarves, not Thorin, he was too important and stayed talking to Gandalf,
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:57.200]   jumped to their feet and made tall piles of all the things. Off they went, not waiting for
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.160]   trays, balancing columns of plates, each with a bottle on the top, with one hand while the hobbit
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:07.040]   ran after them almost squeaking with fright. "Oh please be careful, and please don't travel like I can
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:14.080]   manage." But the dwarves only started to sing. "Ship the glasses and crack the plates, blood the
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:20.240]   knives and bend the forks. That's what Bilbo baggings hates. Smash the bottles and burn the corks.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.760]   Cut the cloths and tread on the fat. Pour the milk on the pantry floor. Leave the bone and
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:32.400]   bedroom mats, splash the wine on every door. Jumped the crocs in a boiling bowl, pound them up with
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:39.600]   a thumping pole, and when you finish them any a hole, send them down the halter roll. That's
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:45.280]   what Bilbo baggings hates. So carefully, carefully with the plates." And of course they did
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:50.480]   none of these dreadful things, and everything was cleaned and put away safe as quick as lightning,
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:54.800]   while the hobbit was turning round and round in the middle of the kitchen, trying to see what they
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:00.640]   were doing. Then they went back and found thorrin with his feet on the fender, smoking a pipe.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:08.640]   He was blowing the most enormous smoke rings, and wherever he told one to go, it went. Up the chimney,
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:14.080]   or behind the clock on the mantelpiece, or under the table or round and round the ceiling, but
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:21.440]   wherever it went, it was not quick enough to escape Gandalf. Pop. He sent a smaller smoke ring from
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:28.080]   his short clay pipe, straight through each one of thorrin's, then Gandalf smoke ring would go green
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:33.280]   and come back to hover over the wizard's head. He had a cloud of them about him already,
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:40.560]   and in the dim light it made him look strange and saucerous. Bilbo stood still and watched.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:47.600]   He loved smoke rings, and then he blushed to think how proud he had been yesterday morning,
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.200]   and the smoke rings he had sent up the wind over the hill.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:58.480]   "Now for some music," said Thorrin. "Bring out the instruments."
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:04.640]   Killian Philly rushed for their bags and brought back little fiddles. Dory, nori, and Orie
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.640]   brought out flutes from somewhere inside their coats. Bilbo produced a drum from the hall,
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:13.040]   Biffer and Buffle went out to and came back with clarinets that they had left among the walking sticks.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:22.240]   Dwellin and Balin said, "Excuse me, I left mine in the porch. Just bring mine in with you," said Thorrin.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:29.360]   They came back with vials as big as themselves and with Thorrin's harp wrapped in a green cloth.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:35.360]   It was a beautiful golden harp, and when Thorrin struck it the music began all at once,
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:44.400]   so sudden and sweet that Bilbo forgot everything else and was swept away into dark lands,
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:51.680]   under strange moons, far over the water, and very far from his hobbit hole under the hill.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:57.280]   The dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of the hill.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:05.520]   The firelight flicked. It was April, and still I played on while the shadow of Gandalf's beard.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.280]   wagged against the wall. The dark filled all the room and the fire died down and the shadows
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:20.960]   were lost and still they played on, and suddenly, first one, and then another began to sing as they
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:26.640]   played deep-throated singing of the dwarfs in the deep places of their ancient homes.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:33.040]   And this is like a fragment of their song, if it can be like their song without their music.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:50.880]   All over, the misty mountains cold, to dungeons deep, and caverns old, we must away,
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:27:08.240]   airbreak of day, to seek the pain, and shunned to gold, the doors of your maiden mighty spells,
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:22.560]   while hammers fell like ringing bells in places deep, where dark things sleep in hollow
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:38.880]   holes beneath the fells, for a shunned king, and Elvish lord, their menier gleaming golden hoard,
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:51.760]   they shaped and wrought and light they caught, to hide in gems on hilltop's sword,
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:28:04.640]   all silver necklaces they strung, the flowering stars, on crowns they hung, the dragon fire
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:19.920]   in twisted wire, they meshed the light of moon and sun, far over, the misty mountains cold,
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:35.760]   to dungeons deep, and caverns old, we must away, airbreak of day, to claim our long, for
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:49.040]   garden gold, goblets they carved, therefore themselves, and hops of gold, were no mandels,
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:29:03.120]   they lay their long, and many a song was sung and heard by men or elves, the pines were roaring
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:14.960]   on the height, the winds were moaning in the night, the fire was red, its flaming spread,
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:28.320]   the trees like torches blazed with light, the bells were ringing in the dale, and men looked up,
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:39.440]   with faces pale, then dragons o'er, more fierce than fire, laid low their towers,
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:50.640]   and houses frail, the mountain smoked beneath the moon, the dwarves they heard,
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:30:06.240]   the tramp of doom, they fled their whole, to dying fall beneath his feet, beneath the moon,
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:18.800]   far over, the misty mountains grim, to dungeons deep, and caverns dim,
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:35.200]   we must away, airbreak of day, to win our harps, and gold from him."
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:42.960]   As they sang, the Hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands,
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:49.440]   and by cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce and a jealous love,
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:57.680]   the desire of the hearts of dwarves, then something tuckish woke up inside him,
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:04.240]   and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine trees and the waterfalls
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:11.120]   and explore the caves and wear a sword instead of a walking stick. He looked out of the window,
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:19.120]   the stars were out in a dark sky above the trees, he thought of the jewels of the dwarves shining
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:24.400]   in dark caverns, suddenly in the wood beyond the water, a flame leaped up,
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.880]   probably someone lighting a woodfire, and he thought of plundering dragons settling on his
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:36.080]   quiet hill and kindling it all to flames. He shuddered, and very quickly he was plain
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:44.160]   Mr Baggins' a bag end under hill again. He got up, trembling. He had less than half a mind
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:48.720]   to fetch the lamp and more than half a mind to pretend to, and go and hide behind the
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.400]   the beer barrels in the cellar and not come out again until all the dwarves had gone away.
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:57.600]   Suddenly he found that the music and the singing had stopped, and they were all looking at him,
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.920]   with eyes shining in the dark.
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:08.320]   "Where are you going?" said Thorin, in a tone that seemed to show that he guessed both halves
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:16.400]   of the hobbits' mind. "What about a little light?" said Bilbo, apologetically.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:25.920]   "We like the dark," said all the dwarves, "dark for dark business. There are many hours before dawn."
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:31.920]   "Of course!" said Bilbo, and sat down in a hurry. He missed the stool and sat in the
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:38.240]   fender knocking over the pocket and shovel with a crash. "Hush!" said Gandalf. "Let Thorin speak."
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:49.840]   And this is how Thorin began. Gandalf dwarves and Mr Baggins. We are met together in a house of our
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:55.360]   friend and fellow conspirator this most excellent and audacious hobbit made the hair on his toes
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:01.600]   never fall out, all praise to his wine and ale. He paused for breath and for a polite remark from
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:06.000]   the hobbit, but the compliments were quite lost on poor Bilbo Baggins, who was wagging his mouth in
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.240]   protest at being called audacious and worst of all fellow conspirator, though no noise came out,
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:20.080]   he was so flummoxed, so Thorin went on. "We are met to discuss our plans, our ways,
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:27.280]   means, policy and devices. We shall soon, before the break of day, start on our long journey,
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:32.080]   a journey from which some of us, or perhaps all of us, except our friend and council of the
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:41.200]   ingenious wizard, Gandalf, may never return. It is a solemn moment. Our object is, I take it,
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:46.640]   well known to us all, to the estimable Mr Baggins, and perhaps to one or two of the younger dwarves,
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:52.160]   I think I should be right in naming Kili in Philly, for instance, the exact situation at the moment,
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:59.680]   may require a little brief explanation." This was Thorin's style, he was an important dwarf,
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.120]   if he'd been allowed he probably would have gone on like this until he was out of breath,
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:09.120]   without telling anyone there anything that was not known already. But he was rudely interrupted,
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:15.680]   poor Bilbo couldn't bear it any longer, at may never return, he began to feel a shriek coming up
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:22.160]   inside and very soon it burst out like the whistle of an engine coming out of a tunnel. All the dwarves
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:27.680]   sprang up, knocking over the table, Gandalf struck a blue light on the end of his magic staff,
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:33.200]   and in its firework glare, the poor hobbit could be seen kneeling on the half-rug,
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:38.400]   shaking like a jelly that was melting. Then he fell flat on the floor and kept calling out,
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:45.040]   "Screw my lightning!" "Screw my lightning!" Over and over again, and that was all they could get
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:50.080]   out of him for a long time, so they took him and laid him out of the way on the drawing sofa
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:57.200]   with a drink at his elbow, and they went back to their dark business. "You're excitable little fellow,"
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:03.680]   said Gandalf, as they sat down again, "gets funny queer fits, but he is one of the best.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:08.160]   One of the best, as fierce as a dragon in a pinch."
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:13.360]   If you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch, you will realize that this was only
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:19.040]   a pre-poeticle exaggeration applied to any hobbit, even to old Took's great-grand Uncle
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.600]   Bulrora, who was so huge for hobbit that he could ride a horse.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:29.680]   He charged the ranks of the goblins of Mount Graham in the Battle of the Greenfields,
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:35.680]   and knocked their king, Gulfimbles head clean off with a wooden club. It sailed a hundred yards
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:41.440]   through the air and went down a rabbit hole, and in this way, the battle was one,
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:47.360]   and the game of Gulf invented at the same moment. In the meanwhile, however, Bulrora's gentler
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:53.200]   descendant was reviving in the drawing room, after a while and a drink he crept nervously to the
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:36:01.440]   door of the parlor. "This is what he heard, blowing speaking." "Hm, or some snort more or less like
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:07.280]   that. Will he do, do you think?" "It's all very well for Gandalf to talk about this,
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:12.480]   hobbit being fierce, but one shriek like that in a moment of excitement would be enough to
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:19.280]   weak the dragon, and all his relatives, and kill a lot of us. I think it sounded more like
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:24.720]   fright than excitement. In fact, if it had not been for the sign on the door, I should have been
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:30.560]   sure we'd come to the wrong house, as soon as I clapped eyes on the little fellow bobbing and puffing
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:36.320]   on the mat, the head and my notes. He looks more like a grocer than a burglar."
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:44.240]   Then, Mr. Baggins turned the handle and went in. The took side had won. He suddenly felt he
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:50.640]   would go without bed and breakfast to be thought fierce. That's for the little fellow bobbing on
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:57.360]   the mat, it almost made him really fierce. Many a time afterwards, the Baggins' part regretted
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:03.440]   what he did now, and he said to himself, "Bobo, you were a fool, you were writing and put your
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:09.440]   foot in it. Pardon me," he said. "If I have overheard words that you were saying, I don't pretend
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:15.600]   to understand what you are talking about or to your reference to burglars, but I think I'm writing
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:23.680]   believing this is what he called being on his dignity, that you think I am no good. I will show you.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:30.240]   I have no signs on my door. It was painted a week ago, and I'm quite sure you've come to the wrong
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:35.200]   house. As soon as I saw your funny faces on the doorstep, I had my doubts. But treatise as the
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:42.320]   right one, tell me what you want done and I will try. If I have to walk from here to the east of
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:49.280]   east and fight the wild, wear worms in the last desert, I had a great, great, great grand uncle
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:56.560]   once. Borrower took and, yes, yes, but that was long ago who said glowing. I was talking about you,
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:02.960]   and I assure you there is a mark on this door, the usual one in the trade, or used to be,
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:09.840]   burglar wants a good job plenty of excitement and reasonable reward. That's how it's usually read.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:14.560]   But you can say expert treasure hunter instead of burglar, if you like, some of them do,
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:19.440]   it's all that seemed to us. Gandalf told us there was a man of the sort, these parts looking for a
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:24.560]   job at once, and that he had arranged for a meeting here this Wednesday, tea time.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:32.000]   "Of course there is a mark," said Gandalf. "I put it there myself. For very good reasons.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:39.680]   You asked me to find the 14th man for your expedition, and I chose Mr. Baggins,
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:44.400]   just let anyone say I chose the wrong man or the wrong house, and you could stop at 13 and
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.600]   have all the bad luck you like, or go back to digging coal."
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:55.840]   He scowls so angrily at blowing that the dwarf huddled back in his chair, and when Bilbo
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:01.600]   tried to open his mouth to ask a question, he turned and frowned at him and stuck out his
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.480]   bushy eyebrows till Bilbo shut his mouth tight with a snap.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:12.560]   "That's right," said Gandalf. "Let's have no more argument. I have chosen Mr. Baggins,
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:20.640]   and that ought to be enough for all of you. If I say he is a burglar, a burglar he is,
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:25.280]   or will be when the time comes. There is a lot more in him than you guess,
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:32.960]   and a deal more than he has any idea of himself. You may, possibly, all live to thank me yet.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:39.520]   Now, Bilbo, my boy, fix the lamp, and let's have a little light on this."
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:47.360]   "On the table, in the light of a big lamp with a red shade, he spread a piece of parchment,
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.960]   rather like a map."
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:57.040]   "This was made by Thor, your grandfather Thorin," he said in answer to the dwarf's excited
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:04.160]   questions. "It is a plan of the mountain. I don't see that this will help as much," said Thorin,
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:09.040]   disappointingly after a glance. "I remember the mountain well enough, and the lands about it,
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:13.360]   and I know where my wood is, and the withered heath, where the great dragons bred."
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:19.840]   "There is a dragon marked in red on the mountain," said Bilbo, "but it will be easy enough to find
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.800]   him without that, if we ever arrive there."
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:29.520]   "There is one point you haven't noticed," said the withered, "and that is the secret entrance.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:34.480]   You see that rune on the west side, and the hand pointed to it from the other rooms.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.760]   That marks a hidden passage to the lower halls."
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:44.880]   "It may have been secret once," said Thorin. "But how do we know that it is secret any longer?
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:50.960]   Old Smaug is lived there long enough now to find out anything there is to know about those caves."
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:54.720]   "He may, but he can't have used it for years and years."
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:58.000]   "Why? Because it is too small.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:05.120]   Five feet high the door and three may walk abreast," said the runes, "but Smaug could not creep
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:12.480]   into a hole that size, not even when he was a young dragon, certainly not after devouring so many
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.560]   of the dwarves and men of Dale."
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:23.200]   "It seems a great big hole to me," squeaked Bilbo, who had no experience of dragons and
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:28.720]   only of hobbit holes. He was getting excited and interested again so that he forgot to keep his mouth shut.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:34.800]   He loved maps, and in his hall there hung a large one of the country around with all his
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:41.680]   favorite walks marked on it in red ink. "How could such a large door be kept secret from everybody
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:46.960]   outside, apart from the dragon?" he asked. "He was only a little hobbit you must remember."
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:53.680]   "In lots of ways," said Gandalf, "but in what way this one has been hidden we don't know
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.120]   without going to see."
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:01.520]   "From what it says on the map I should guess there is a closed door which has been made to look
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:08.560]   exactly like the side of the mountain. That is the usualed war's method, I think that is right, isn't it?"
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:16.320]   "Quite right," said Thoran. "Also," went on Gandalf, "I forgot to mention that with the map
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:26.640]   went a key, a small and curious key. Here it is," he said, and handed to Thoran a key with a long barrel
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:30.560]   and intricate wards made of silver. "Keep it safe."
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:36.640]   "Indeed I will," said Thoran, and he fastened it upon a fine chain that hung about his neck
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:42.400]   and under his jacket. "Now things begin to look more hopeful. This news alters the much
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:48.960]   for the better. So far we have had no clear idea what to do. We thought to go an east. As quiet
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:54.320]   and careful as we could as far as the long lake. After that the trouble would begin."
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:43:00.160]   "Or long time before that if I know anything about the route east," interrupted Gandalf.
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:06.240]   "We might go from there, up along the river running," went on Thoran taking no notice,
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:11.680]   and so to the ruins of Dale, the old town in the valley there under the shadow of the mountain.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.720]   "But we none of us like the idea of the front gate. The river runs right out of it
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:22.480]   through the great cliff at the south of the mountain, and out of it comes the dragon to far too
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:29.120]   often. Unless he's changed his habits." "That would be no good," said the wizard. "Not without a mighty
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:35.120]   warrior, even a hero. I tried to find one but warriors of busy fighting one another in distant lands,
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:40.640]   and in this neighborhood heroes are scarce or simply not to be found. Swords in these parts are
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:47.440]   mostly blunt and axes are used for trees and shields as cradles or discovers and dragons are
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:56.960]   comfortably far off, and therefore legendary. That is why I settled on burglary. Especially when
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:05.440]   I remember the existence of a side door, and here is our little Bilbo Baggins, the burglar,
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:14.000]   the chosen and selected burglar. So now, let's get on and make some plans." "Very well, then," said Thoran.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:20.240]   "Supposing the burglar gives us some ideas or suggestions," he turned with mock politeness to Bilbo.
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:28.880]   "Well, first I should like to know a bit more about things," said he, feeling all confused
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:32.960]   a bit shaky inside, but so fast, still took his lead determined to go on with things.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:40.160]   I mean, about the gold and the dragon and all that, and how it got there and who it belongs to,
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:47.280]   and so on and further, bless me," said Thoran. "I haven't you got a map, and didn't you hear our
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:54.080]   song, and haven't we been talking about all this for hours?" "All the same, I should like it,
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:58.960]   all plain and clear," said he, obviously, putting on his business manner, usually reserved for
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.720]   people who tried to borrow money off him, and doing his best to appear wise and prudent and
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:08.800]   professional and lived up to Gandalf's recommendation. Also, I should like to know about risks,
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:14.640]   out of pocket expenses, his time required and remuneration and so forth, by which he meant,
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.360]   what am I going to get out of it, and am I going to come back alive?"
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:21.440]   "Very well," said Thoran.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:31.280]   "Long ago, in my grandfather's thraws time, our family was driven out of the far north,
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:35.920]   and came back with all their wealth and their tools to this mountain on the map.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:43.520]   It had been discovered by my far ancestor, Thrain, the old, but now they mined and they tunneled,
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:50.000]   and they made huge halls and great workshops, and in addition, I believe they found a good deal
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:57.360]   of gold and a great many jewels too. Anyway, the grew immensely rich and famous and my grandfather
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:03.600]   was king under the mountain again, and treated with great reverence by the mortal men who lived
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:07.520]   to the south and were gradually spreading up the running river as far as the valley over shadowed
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:14.240]   by the mountain. They built the merry town of Dale there in those days. Kings used to send for
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:20.960]   our smiths and reward even the least skillful most richly. Fathers would beggars to take their
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:27.040]   sons as apprentices and pay us handsomely, especially in food supplies which we never bothered to
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:33.520]   grow or find for ourselves. All together, those were good days for us, and the poorest of us had money
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:40.320]   to spend, and to lend, and leisure to make beautiful things just for the fun of it. Not to speak
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:46.080]   of the most marvelous and magical toys, the like of which is not to be found in the world nowadays.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:53.760]   So, my grandfather's halls became full of armor and jewels and carvings and cups,
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:47:01.600]   and the toy market of Dale was the wonder of the north. Undoubtedly, that was what brought the dragon.
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:09.920]   Dragons steal gold and jewels, you know, from men and elves and dwarves, wherever they can find them,
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:14.400]   and they guard their plunder as long as they live, which is practically forever unless they're killed.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:22.320]   I never enjoy a brass ring of it. Indeed, they hardly know a good bit of work from a bad,
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:27.680]   though they usually have a good notion of the current market value, and they can't make a thing
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:33.200]   for themselves, not even mend a little loose scale of their armor. There were lots of dragons in
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:37.600]   the north in those days, and gold was probably getting scarce up there with the dwarves flying
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:43.040]   south for getting killed, and all the general waste and destruction that dragons make, going from
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:53.280]   bad to worse. There was a most specially greedy, strong, and wicked worm called Smaug.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:48:00.240]   One day flew up into the air and came south. The first we heard of it was a noise like a hurricane
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:05.440]   coming from the north, and the pine trees and the mountain creaking and cracking in the wind.
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:09.840]   Some of the dwarves who happened to be outside, I was one luckily a fine adventure
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:13.920]   is lighting those days, always wondering about and it saved my life that day.
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:20.240]   Well, from a good way off we saw the dragon settle on our mountain in a spout of flame.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:26.720]   Then he came down the slopes, and when he reached the woods they all went up in fire,
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:30.160]   but at that time all the bells were ringing in Dale and the warriors were arming.
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:35.920]   The dwarves rushed out of their great gate, but there was the dragon waiting for him,
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:43.600]   non-escape that way. The river rushed up in steam and a fog fell on Dale and in the fog,
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:49.520]   the dragon came on them and destroyed most of the warriors, the usual unhappy story.
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:53.840]   He was only too common in those days, then he went back and crept in through the front gate
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:59.760]   and routed out all the halls and lanes and tunnels, alleys, sellers, mansions and passages.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:06.080]   After that there were no dwarves left alive inside, and he took all their wealth
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:13.280]   for himself, probably for that is the dragon's way, he has piled it all up in a great ape far inside
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:20.960]   and sleeps on it for a bed. Later, he used to crawl out of the great gate and come by night to Dale
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:26.160]   and carry away people, especially maidens, to eat until Dale was ruined.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:32.160]   And all the people dead are gone. What goes on there now, I don't know for certain,
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:37.360]   but I don't suppose anyone lives nearer to the mountain than the far edge of the long late nowadays.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:45.040]   The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding and cursing smog,
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:53.840]   and there we were, unexpectedly joined by my father and grandfather with singed beards.
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.680]   They looked very grim, but they said very little.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:03.440]   When I asked how they'd got away they told me to hold my tongue and said that one day in the
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:10.560]   proper time I should know. After that we went away and we had to earn our livings as best we could
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:17.120]   up and down the lands, often enough sinking as low as blacksmith work or even coal mining.
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:24.560]   But we have never forgotten our stolen treasure. And even now when I will allow we have a good bit
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:30.720]   laid by and are not so badly off. Here, for in stroked the gold chain around his neck,
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:36.800]   we still mean to get it back and to bring our curses home to smog if we can.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:41.920]   I've often wondered about my father's and my grandfather's escape.
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:49.520]   I see now they must have had a private side door which only they knew about but apparently
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:55.760]   they made a map and I should like to know how Gandalf got hold of it and why it did not come down to me,
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:56.720]   the rightful heir.
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:05.280]   I did not get hold of it. I was given it, said the wizard. Your grandfather Thore was
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:13.360]   killed, you remember, in the minds of Moria by Azog the Goblin. Because his name, yes,
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:20.320]   said Thore. And Thrain your father went away on the 21st of April 100 years ago last Thursday
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:26.080]   and has never been seen by you since. True, true, said Thore.
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:34.960]   Well, your father gave me this to give you and if I have chosen my own time and way for handing it
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:40.880]   over, you can hardly blame me considering the trouble I had to find you. Your father could not
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:46.480]   remember his own name when you came to give me the paper and he never told me yours. So on the
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:54.640]   whole I think I ought to be praised and thanked. Here it is," said he, handing the map to Thore.
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:52:00.080]   "I don't understand," said Thore. And Bilbo felt he would like to say the same.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:03.840]   The explanation did not seem to explain.
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:12.800]   Your grandfather said the wizard slowly and grimly gave the map to his son for safety.
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:19.440]   Before he went to the minds of Moria, your father went away to try his luck with the map
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:25.680]   after your grandfather was killed and lots of adventures of a most unpleasant sort he had.
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:32.320]   But he never got near the mountain. How he got there, I don't know. But I found him a prisoner
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:41.280]   in the dungeons of the necromancer. Whatever were you doing there, I was throwing with a shudder
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:47.680]   and all the dwarves shoot. "Never you mind. I was finding things out as usual
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:56.080]   and a nasty dangerous business it was. Even I, Gandalf, only just escaped. I tried to save your
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:53:03.440]   father but it was too late. He was wickless and wandering and if we got an almost everything except the
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:12.400]   map and the key. We have long ago paid the goblins of Moria," said Thore. "We must give a thought to
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:19.600]   the necromancer." "Don't be absurd. He is an enemy far beyond the powers of all the dwarves put
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:23.840]   together if they could all be collected again from the four corners of the world.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:29.760]   The one thing your father wished was for his son to read the map and use the key.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:35.040]   The dragon and the mountain are more than big enough tasks for you."
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:38.160]   "Yeah," said Bilbo and accidentally said it aloud.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:43.200]   "Here what?" they all said, turning suddenly towards him and he was so flustered that he
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:46.400]   answered. "Here what I have got to say."
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:53.920]   "What's that?" they asked. "Well, I should say that you ought to go east and have a look around
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:59.360]   and after all there is a side dawn dragon must sleep sometimes. I suppose if you sit on the door
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:03.280]   step long enough, I dare say you'll think of something and well don't you know?"
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:09.040]   "I think we have talked long enough for one night if you see what I mean. What about bed and an early
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:11.840]   start and all that? I'll give you a good breakfast before you go."
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:17.120]   "Before we go." "I suppose you mean," said Thoreen.
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:24.640]   "Aren't you the burger? And isn't sitting on the doorstep your job? Not to speak of getting inside
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:31.520]   the door, but I agree about bed and breakfast. I like six eggs with me ham when starting on a journey,
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:34.080]   fried not poached and mind you, don't break him."
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:39.840]   After all the others had ordered their breakfast without so much as a pleas which in
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:47.440]   we'd build by very much they all got up. The Hobbit had to find room for all of them and filled
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:53.040]   all his spare rooms and made beds on chairs and sofas before he got them all stowed and went to his
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:55:00.400]   own little bed very tired and not all together happy. One thing he did make his mind up about was
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:05.520]   not to bother to get up very early and cook everybody else's wretched breakfast.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:13.040]   The tuckishness was wearing off and he was not now quite so sure that he was going on any journey
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:19.760]   in the morning. As he lay in bed, he could hear Thoreen still humming to himself in the best
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:32.800]   bedroom next to him. Far over, a misty mountains cold, two dungeons deep, and caverns old,
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:45.440]   we must stay, air break of day, to find our home, forgotten goal.
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:53.200]   Bilbo went to sleep with that in his ears and it gave him very uncomfortable dreams.
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:57.840]   It was long after the break of day when he woke up.
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:04.160]   Chapter 2. Roast Mutton
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:09.840]   Up jumped Bilbo and putting on his dressing gown went into the dining room. There he saw
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:16.160]   nobody but all the signs of a large and hurried breakfast. There was a fearful mess in the room
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:20.560]   and piles of unwashed crocs in the kitchen nearly every pot and pan he possessed seemed to have
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:25.760]   been used. The washing up was so dizzmily real that Bilbo was forced to believe the party of the
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:32.080]   night before had not been part of his bad dreams as he had rather hoped. Indeed, he was really
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:36.800]   relieved to think that they had all gone without him and without bothering to wake him up but
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:43.200]   never thank you, he thought, and yet in a way he could not help feeling just a trifle disappointed.
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:48.480]   The feeling surprised him. "Don't be a full Bilbo Baggins," he said to himself,
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:53.760]   thinking of dragons and all that outlandish nonsense at your age, so he put on an apron,
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:57:00.160]   lit fires, boiled water, and washed up. Then he had a nice little breakfast in the kitchen before
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:05.040]   turning out the dining room. By that time the sun was shining and the front door was open,
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:11.760]   letting in a warm spring breeze. Bilbo began to whistle loudly and to forget about the night before.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:16.400]   In fact, he was just sitting down to a nice little second breakfast in the dining room by the
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:24.480]   open window when in walked Gandalf. "My dear fellow, city, whenever are you going to come? What about
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:31.360]   an early start? And here you are having breakfast or whatever you call it at half past 10.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:37.200]   They left you the message because they could not wait. But what message," said Paul Mr. Baggins
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:42.640]   all in a fluster. "Great elephant," said Gandalf. "You are not at all yourself this morning.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:48.640]   You have never dusted the mantelpiece. What's that got to do with it? I've had enough to do with
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:55.120]   washing up for fourteen. If you had dusted the mantelpiece, you would have found this just under the clock,"
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:58:00.800]   said Gandalf, handing Bilbo a note written, of course, on his own note paper. "This is what he
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:08.400]   read." Thoreen and company to burglar Bilbo greeting. "For your hospitality are since
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:13.280]   serious thanks and for your offer of professional assistance, our grateful acceptance.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:19.280]   Terms, cash on delivery, up to and not exceeding one-fourteenth of total profits, if any,
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:25.440]   all travelling expenses guaranteed in any event. Funeral expenses to be defraid by us or are
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:30.240]   representatives, if occasion arises and the matter is not otherwise arranged for."
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:36.560]   Thinking it unnecessary to disturb your esteemed repose, we have proceeded in advance
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:41.840]   to make requisite preparations and shall await your respected person at the green dragon in
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:49.040]   by water at eleven AM sharp, trusting that you will be punctual. We have the honour to remain
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:56.320]   yours deeply, thoreen and co. "That leaves you just ten minutes. You will have to run,"
[00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:00.800]   said Gandalf, "but," said Bilbo, "no time for it," said the wizard, "but," said Bilbo again,
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:06.240]   "no time for that either, off you go." To the end of his days Bilbo could never remember how he
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:11.520]   found himself outside without a hat, a walking stick or any money, or anything that he usually
[00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:16.480]   took when he went out, leaving his second breakfast half finished and quite unwashed up,
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:21.360]   pushing his keys into Gandalf's hands and running as fast as his furry feet could carry him
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:25.840]   down the lane past the great mill across the water and then on for a mile or more.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:30.400]   Very puffed he was when he got to buy water just on the stroke of eleven and he found he had
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:37.040]   come without a pocket handkerchief. "Bravo," said Bilbo, who was standing at the indoor,
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:42.240]   looking out for him. Just then all the others came around the corner of the road from the village.
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:48.000]   They were on ponies and each pony was slung about with all kinds of baggages,
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:53.680]   packages, parcels, and paraphernalia. There was a very small pony, apparently for Bilbo.
[00:59:53.680 --> 01:00:01.360]   "Up you to get an off we go," said Thoreen. "Oh, I'm awfully sorry," said Bilbo, "but I have come
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:06.560]   without my hat and I have left my pocket handkerchief behind and I haven't got any money and I didn't
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:11.040]   get your note until after 1045 to be precise, don't be precise."
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:15.680]   Said, "Dwellen, I don't worry. You will have to manage without pocket handkerchiefs
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:19.840]   and are good many other things before you get to the journey's end. As for a hat,
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:22.160]   I have got a spare hood and a cloak in my luggage."
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:28.320]   That's how they all came to start jogging off from the inn one fine morning just before
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:35.680]   May on laden ponies and Bilbo was wearing a dark green hood a little weather stain and a dark
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:41.200]   green cloak borrowed from dwelling. They were too large for him and he looked rather comic.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:46.640]   What his father bungo would have thought of him, I danc'd think, his only comfort was he couldn't
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:53.360]   be mistaken for a dwarf as he had no beard. They had not been riding very long when up came Gandalf
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:59.360]   very splendid on a white horse. He had brought a lot of pocket handkerchiefs and Bilbo's pipe
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:05.040]   and tobacco, so after that the party went along very merrily and they told stories or sang
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:09.680]   songs as they rode forward all day except of course when they stopped for meals. These didn't
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:13.920]   come quite as often as Bilbo would have liked them but still he began to feel that
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:20.240]   adventures were not so bad after all. At first they had passed through Hobbit lands, a wide,
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:26.240]   respectable country inhabited by decent folk with good roads and in or two and now and then a
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:32.160]   dwarf for a farmer ambling by on business. Then they came to lands where people spoke strangely
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:38.560]   and sang songs Bilbo had never heard before. Now they had gone on far into the lowlands
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:45.440]   where there were no people left, no inns and the roads grew steadily worse. Not far ahead were
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:52.640]   dreary hills rising higher and higher dark with trees. On some of them were old castles
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:59.440]   with an evil look as if they had been built by wicked people everything seemed gloomy.
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:04.560]   For the weather that day had taken a nasty turn. Mostly it had been as good as may can be
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:12.560]   even in merry tales but now it was cold and wet. In the lowlands they had been obliged to camp
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:20.480]   when they could but at least it had been dry. To think it'll soon be June, grumbled Bilbo as he
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:27.040]   splashed along behind the others in a very muddy track. It was after tea time. It was pouring
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:34.000]   with rain and had been all day. His hood was dripping into his eyes. His cloak was full of water
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:39.360]   the pony was tired and stumbled on stones. The others were too grumpy to talk.
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:44.800]   And I'm sure the rain has got into the dry clothes and into the food bags for Bilbo.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:51.760]   Both are burgling and everything to do with it. I wish I was at home in my nice hole by the fire
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:56.480]   with the kettle just beginning to sing. It was not the last time he'd wished that.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:01.920]   Still the dwarves jogged on never turning around or taking any notice of the hobbit.
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:08.960]   Somewhere behind the grey clouds the sun must have gone down for it began to get dark as they went down
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:15.920]   into a deep valley with a river at the bottom. Wind got up and willows along its bank's bent and
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:23.280]   sigh. Fortunately the road went over an ancient stone bridge for the river sworn with the rains
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:28.400]   came rushing down from the hills and mountains in the north. It was nearly night when they had
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:34.720]   crossed over. The wind broke up the grey clouds and a wandering moon appeared above the hills
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:40.880]   between the flying rags. Then they stopped and thuring muttered something about supper
[01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:47.680]   and where should we get a dry patch to sleep on. Not until then did they notice that Gandalf was missing.
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:54.000]   So far he had come all the way with them never saying if he was in the adventure or merely
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:00.960]   keeping them company for a while he had eaten most talked most and laughed most but now he was simply
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:08.080]   not there at all. Just when a wizard would have been most useful too, grown dory and nori who shared
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:13.760]   the hobbits of use about regular meals plenty and often. They decided in the end they would
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:19.600]   have to camp where they were. They moved to a clump of trees and thought it was drier under them.
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:25.760]   The wind shook the rain off the leaves and the drip drip was most annoying. Also the mischief
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:32.160]   seemed to have got into the fire. Dwarves can make a fire almost anywhere out of almost anything
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:37.600]   wind or knowing but they could not do it that night not even Owen and glowing who were specially
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:44.720]   good at it. Then one of the ponies took fright at nothing and bolted. He got into the river before
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:51.120]   they could catch him and before they could get him out again filly and killy when nearly drowned and
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:56.880]   all the baggage that he carried was washed away off him. Of course it was mostly food and there
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:03.680]   was mighty little left for supper and less for breakfast. There they all sat, glum and wet
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:08.560]   and muttering while Owen and glowing went on trying to light the fire and quarreling about it.
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:16.160]   Bilbo was sadly reflecting that the benches are not all pony rides in May sunshine when
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:23.040]   Balen who was always there look out man said there's a light over there. There was a hill
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:28.880]   somewhere off with trees on it pretty thick in parts out of the dark mass of the trees they could
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:37.200]   now see a light shining, a reddish comfortable looking light as it might be a fire or torches twinkling.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:45.200]   When they had looked at it for some while they fell to arguing some said no and some said
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:52.080]   yes some said they could but go and see and anything was better than little supper less breakfast
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:58.480]   and wet clothes all the night. Others said these parts are none too well known
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:02.640]   and attunier the mountains traveler seldom come this way now the old maps are no use
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:08.400]   things have changed for the worse and the road is unguarded they have seldom even heard of the king
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:14.000]   around here and the less inquisitive you are as you go along the less trouble you are likely to find
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:23.280]   some said after all there are 14 of us other said here is Gandalf got to this remark was repeated by
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:29.200]   everybody then the rain began to pour down worse than ever and Owen and glowing began to fight
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:35.920]   that settled it after all we have got a burglar with us they said and so they made off
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:41.840]   leading their ponies with all due and proper caution in the direction of the light they came to the
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:47.440]   hill and were soon in the wood up the hill they went but there was no proper path to be seen
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:52.880]   such as might lead to a house or a farm and do what they could they made a deal of rustling and
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:58.240]   crackling and creaking and a good deal of grumbling and ratting as they went through the trees in
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:05.840]   a pitch dark suddenly the red light shone out very bright through the tree trunks not far ahead
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:13.840]   now it is the burglar's turn they said meaning Bilbo you must go on and find out all about that light
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:18.720]   and what it is for and if all is perfectly safe and canny said thaw into the hobbit
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:24.400]   now scuttle off and come back quick if all is well if not come back if you can
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:29.360]   if you can't whoop twice like a barn owl and once like a screech owl we will do what we can
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:36.320]   off Bilbo had to go before he could explain that he could not hoot even once like any kind of owl
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:43.840]   any more than fly like a bat but at any rate hobbits can move quietly inwards absolutely quietly
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:49.600]   they take pride in it and Bilbo had sniffed more than once at what he called all this
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:54.480]   dwarfish racket as they went along though I don't suppose you or I would have noticed anything
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:59.680]   at all on a windy night not if the whole kaval caid had passed two feet off
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:05.920]   as for Bilbo walking primly towards the red light I don't suppose even a weasel would have
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:13.680]   stirred a whisker at it so naturally he got right up to the fire for fire it was without disturbing
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:26.000]   anyone and this is what he saw three very large persons sitting round a very large fire of beach logs
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:32.000]   they were toasting mutton on long spits of wood and licking the gravy of their fingers
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:38.720]   there was a fine tooth and smell also there was a barrel of good drink at hand and they were
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:43.440]   drinking out of jugs but they were trolls obviously
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:50.800]   trolls even Bilbo in spite of his sheltered life could see that from the great heavy faces of them
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:56.560]   and their size and the shape of their legs not to mention their language which was not drawing
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:05.440]   ronfashion at all at all mutton yesterday mutton today and blind if he don't look like mutton again
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:12.480]   tomorrow sit one of the trolls never a blinking bit of maneflish we have prolonged enough
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:18.480]   set a second what the air william was a thinking of to bring us into these parts of soul
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:24.000]   beats me under drink running short once more he said jogging the elbow of william who was taking
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:31.120]   a pull of his jug william choked fragile mouth he said as soon as he could you can't expect
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:38.000]   folk to stop here forever just to react by you and burr you veg a village and a half between
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.920]   your sins we come down from the mountains how much more do you want and times being up our way
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:49.440]   when you'd have said thank you bill for a nice bit of fat valley mutton like what this is
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:56.720]   he took a big bite off sheep's leg he was toasting and wiped his lips on his sleeve yes i am a
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:04.560]   afraid trolls do behave like that even those with only one head each after hearing all this
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:07.840]   Bilbo ought to have done something at once either he should have gone back quietly and warned
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:13.440]   his friends that there were three fair sized trolls at hand in an nasty mood quite likely to try
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:19.440]   toasted dwarf or even pony for a change or else he should have done a bit of good quick birdling
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:23.920]   a really first class legendary burglar would at this point have picked the trolls pockets
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:28.880]   it is nearly always worthwhile if you can manage it pinch the very mutton off the spits
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:35.360]   polyn the beer and walked off without there noticing him others more practical but with less
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:40.800]   professional pride would perhaps have stuck a dagger into each of them before they observed it
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:47.520]   then the night could have been spent cheerily billbo knew it he had read of a good many things he
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:53.440]   had never seen or done he was very much alarmed as well as disgusted he wished himself a hundred
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:59.840]   miles away and yet somehow he could not go straight back to Thorin and company empty handed so he stood
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:05.200]   and hesitated in the shadows of the various burglarious proceedings he had heard of picking the
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:12.400]   trolls pockets seemed the least difficult so at last he crept behind a tree just behind William
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:19.120]   Bert and Tom went off to the barrel William was having another drink then Bilbo plucked up courage
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:26.880]   and put his little hand in Williams enormous pocket there was a person it as big as a bag to
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:35.280]   Bilbo ha thought he warming to his new work as he lifted it carefully out this is a beginning
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:45.920]   it was trolls purses are the mischief and this was no exception yeah oh you it squeaked as it
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:51.200]   left the pocket and William turned round at once and grabbed Bilbo by the neck before he could
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:53.840]   duck behind the tree
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:12:03.360]   I've got said William what is it said the others coming up let me find oh oh yeah
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:12.560]   Bilbo Baggins a burr hobbit said Paul Bilbo shaking all over and wondering how to make owl noises
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:19.440]   before they throttled him a burr hobbit said they a bit startled trolls are slow in the uptake and mighty
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:27.120]   suspicious about anything new to them what a burr hobbit got to do in my pocket anyway said William
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:34.880]   and can you cook them said Tom you could try said Bert picking up a skewer he wouldn't make a
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:40.960]   buffer mouthful said William who'd already had a fine supper not when he was skinned and boned
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:46.640]   perhaps there's more like him routed out and we might make a pie said Bert
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:53.840]   here you are there any more he all sorts sneaking in these earwoods you're nasty they're all
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:59.440]   rabbit said he looking at the hobbits furry feet and he picked him up by the toes and shook him
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:04.560]   yes lots said Bilbo before you remember not to give his friends away
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:12.240]   no none at all not one he said immediately afterwards what do you mean said Bert holding him right
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:18.960]   way up by the hair this time what I say said Bilbo gasping and please don't cook me kind
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:24.400]   sirs I'm a good cook myself and cook better than I cook if you see what I mean I cook beautifully
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:31.120]   for you a perfectly beautiful breakfast for you he won't have me for super poor little brighter
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:37.680]   said William he had already had as much supper as he could hold also he had had lots of beer
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:48.960]   poor little blier lame go not he says what he means by lots and none at all said Bert I don't
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:55.520]   want to have me throw cut me sleep I'll these toes in the fire till eat silks
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:04.960]   I won't have it say William or call him anyway you're a fat fool willy him say Bert as I've said
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:12.560]   a four this evening and you're allowed and I won't take that from you Bill Huggins said
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:21.200]   Bert and puts his fist in William's eye then there was a gorgeous row Bilbo had just
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:25.280]   enough wits left when Bert dropped him on the ground to scramble out of the way of their feet
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:31.840]   before they were fighting like dogs and calling one another all sorts of perfectly true and applicable
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:39.040]   names in very loud voices soon they were locked in one another's arms and rolling nearly into
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:43.920]   the fire kicking and thumping while Tom whacked at them both with a branch to bring them to their
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:48.480]   senses and that of course only made them mader than ever that would have been the time for Bilbo
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:53.440]   to have left but his poor little feet have been very squashed in Bert's big poor and he had no breath
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:15:00.720]   in his body and his head was going round so there he lay for a while panting just outside the circle
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:06.000]   of fire light right in the middle of the fight up came Ballin the dwarves had heard noises
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.520]   from a distance and after waiting for some time for Bilbo to come back or to hoot like an owl
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:16.080]   they started off one by one to creep towards the light as quietly as they could
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:23.920]   no sooner did Tom see Ballin come into the light than he gave an awful how trolls simply detest
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:31.760]   the very sight of dwarves uncooked Bert and Bil stopped fighting immediately and a sack come quick
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:36.640]   they said before Ballin who was wondering where in all this commotion Bilbo was knew what was
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:43.360]   happening a sack was over his head and he was down there's more to come yet said Tom or I might
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:51.840]   he always took lots and none at all it is said he no burrow of it but lots of these year dwarves
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:59.680]   that's about a shape of it I reckon you're right said Bert then we best get out of the light
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:06.400]   and so they did with sacks in their hands that they used for carrying off mutton and other plunder
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:12.560]   they waited in the shadows as each dwarf came up and looked at the fire and the spilled jugs
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:18.880]   and the lord mutton in surprise pop went a nasty smelly sack over his head and he was down
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:24.720]   soon dwelling lay by Ballin and filly and killy together and dory and nori and ori all in a heap
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:29.200]   and owing and glowing and biffer and buffer and bumber piled uncomfortably near the fire
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:36.480]   "doubt teacher" said Tom for biffer and bumber had given a lot of trouble and fought like mad as
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:44.800]   dwarves will when cornered Thorin came last and he was not caught unawares he came expecting
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:49.040]   mischief and didn't need to see his friends leg sticking out of sacks to tell him that things
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:55.920]   were not all well he stood outside in the shadows somewhere off and said "what's all this
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:02.640]   troll who's been knocking my people about it's trolls" said Bilbo from behind a tree they had
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:09.840]   forgotten all about him they're hiding in the bushes with sacks said he "oh are they?" said Thorin
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:15.200]   and he jumped forward to the fire before they could leap on him he caught up a big branch all on
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:20.480]   fire at one end and birt got that end in his eye before he could step aside that put him out of
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:25.440]   the battle for a bit Bilbo did his best he caught hold of Tom's leg as well as he could it was
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:31.440]   thick as a young tree trunk but he was sent spinning up into the top of some bushes when Tom kicked
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:38.560]   the sparks up in Thorin's face Tom got the branch in his teeth for that and lost one of the front ones it
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:43.760]   made him how I can tell you but just at that moment William came up behind and popped a sack right
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:50.960]   over Thorin's head and down to his toes and so the fight ended a nice pickle they were all in now
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:57.360]   all neatly tied up in sacks with three angry trolls and two with burns and bashes to remember
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:02.880]   sitting by them arguing whether they should roast them slowly or mince them fine and boil them
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:09.520]   or just sit on them one by one and squash them into jelly and Bilbo up in a bush with his clothes
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:17.040]   and his skin torn not daring to move for fear they should hear him it was just then that Gandalf
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:23.520]   came back but no one saw him the trolls had just decided to roast the dwarves now and eat them later
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:30.240]   that was bird's idea and after a lot of argument they had all agreed to it no good roasting them
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:38.960]   now it'll take all night set of voice but thought it was Williams don't start a argument all over again
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:45.680]   Bill he said or it will take all night who's arguing said William who thought it was bird who had
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:52.880]   spoken you are said but you're a liar said William and so the argument began all over again
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:59.600]   in the end they decided to mince them fine and boil them so they got a great black pot and they took out
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:07.440]   their knives no good boiling and we ain't got no water and it's a long way down to the well and all
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:14.400]   set of voice Burton William thought it was Tom's shut up said they or will never have done
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:21.360]   and you can fetch the war yourself if you say any more shut up yourself said Tom who thought it
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:30.400]   was William's voice oh he's arguing but you are like to know you're a booby said William booby yourself
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:36.240]   said Tom and so the argument began all over again and went on hotter than ever until at last
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:40.640]   they decided to sit on the sacks one by one and squash them and boil them next time
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:48.640]   oh shall we sit on first said the voice better sit on the last fella first said bird who's
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:55.600]   I had been damaged by thuring he thought Tom was talking don't talk to yourself said Tom
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:20:02.640]   back to you wants to sit on the last one sit on him which is he the bottom of the yellow stockings
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:10.160]   said birth nonsense the one with a gray stockings said a voice like Williams I made sure it
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:17.360]   was yellow said but yellow it was said William then what did you say it was crying for said
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:26.800]   but I never did Tom said it that I never did say Tom it was you two to one to shut your mouth said
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:36.080]   bird oh you are talking to said William now stop it said Tom and bird together the nice gain on
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:43.760]   and Tom comes early let's get on with it don't take you all and be stoned to you said a voice
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:49.440]   that sounded like Williams but it wasn't for just at that moment the light came over the hill
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:55.040]   and there was a mighty twitter in the branches William never spoke for he stood turned to stone
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:21:02.160]   as he stopped and bird and Tom were stuck like rocks as they looked at him and there they stand
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:08.080]   to this day all alone unless the birds perch on them for trolls as you probably know must be
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:12.960]   underground before dawn or they go back to the stuff of the mountains they are made of
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:22.000]   and never move again that is what happened to bird and Tom and William excellent said Gandalf was he
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:28.560]   stepped from behind a tree and helped Bilbo decline down out of a thorn bush then Bilbo understood
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:33.280]   it was the wizard's voice that had kept the trolls bickering and quarreling until the light came
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:39.120]   and made an end of them the next thing to do was to untie the sacks and let out the dwarves
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:46.800]   they were nearly suffocated and very annoyed they had not at all enjoyed lying here listening
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:51.120]   to the trolls making plans for roasting them and squashing them and mincing them
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:57.680]   they had to hear Bilbo's account of what had happened to him twice over before they were satisfied
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:03.360]   silly time to go practicing pinching and pocket picking said bomber when what we wanted was fire and
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:08.560]   food and that's just what you wouldn't have got for those fellows without a struggle in any case
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:14.960]   again elf anyhow you are wasting time now don't you realize that the trolls must have a cave
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:20.880]   or a whole dug somewhere near to hide from the sun in we must look into it they searched about
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:26.640]   and soon found the marks of trolls stony boots going away through the trees they followed the
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:34.400]   tracks up the hill until hidden by bushes they came on a big door of stone leading to a cave
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:41.200]   but they could not open it not though they all pushed while Gandalf tried various incantations
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:47.520]   would this be any good as Bilbo when they were getting tired and angry I found it on the ground
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:53.040]   where the trolls had their fight he held out a largeish key though modout William thought it very
[01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:58.080]   small and secret it must have fallen out of his pocket very luckily before he was turned to stone
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:06.320]   why on earth didn't you mention it before they cried Gandalf grabbed it and fitted it into the keyhole
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:12.000]   then the stone door swung back with one big push and they all went inside there were
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.920]   bones on the floor and a nasty smell was in the air but there was a good deal of food jumbled
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:24.160]   carelessly on shelves on the ground among an untidy litter of plunder of all sorts from
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:30.160]   brass buttons to pots full of gold coins standing in a corner there were lots of clothes too hanging on
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:36.400]   the walls too small for trolls I'm afraid they belong to victims and among them were several
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:42.720]   swords various makes shapes and sizes to caught their eyes particularly because of their beautiful
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:49.920]   scabbards and jewel hills Gandalf and thuring each took one of these and Bilbo took a knife
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:56.400]   in a leather sheath it would have made only a tiny pocket knife for a troll but it was as good as a
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:03.680]   short sword for the hobbit these look like good blades said the wizard half drawing them and
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:09.520]   looking at them curiously they were not made by any troll nor by any smith among men in these
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:14.240]   parts and days but when we can read the rooms on them we shall know more about them
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:21.040]   let's get out of this horrible smell said filly so they carried out the pots of coins and such
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:28.160]   fooders untouched and looked fit to eat also one barrel of ale which was still full by that time
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:32.400]   they felt like breakfast and being very hungry they did not turn their noses up at what they
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:39.600]   had got from the trolls larda their own provisions were very scanty now they had bread and cheese
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:47.120]   and plenty of ale and bacon to toast in the embers of the fire after that they slept for their night
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:52.560]   had been disturbed and they did nothing more till the afternoon then they brought up their ponies
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:58.400]   and carried away the pots of gold and buried them very secretly not far from the track by the river
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:04.000]   putting a great many spells over them just in case they ever had the chance to come back
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:10.480]   and recover them when that was done they all mounted once more and jogged along again on the path
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:17.520]   towards the east where did you go to if I may ask said thawing to Gandalf as they wrote along
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:26.400]   to look ahead said he and what brought you back in the nick of time looking behind city
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:36.560]   exactly said thawing but could you be more plain I went on to spy out our road it will soon become
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:43.040]   dangerous and difficult also I was anxious about replenishing our small stock of provisions I had
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:52.000]   not gone very far however when I met a couple of friends of mine from river no where's that
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:57.840]   oh spill though don't interrupt said Gandalf you will get there in a few days now if we're lucky
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:05.440]   and find out all about it as I was saying I met two of Elrond's people they were hurrying
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:10.560]   along for fear of the trolls it was they who call me that the three of them had come down from
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:16.800]   the mountains and settled in the woods not far from the road they had frightened everyone away
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:24.800]   from the district and they way laid strangers I immediately had a feeling that I was wanted back
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:33.280]   looking behind I saw a fire in the distance and made for it so now you know please be more careful
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:39.040]   next time or we shall never get anywhere thank you said thawing
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:50.240]   chapter three a short rest they did not sing or tell stories that day even though the weather
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:56.240]   improved nor the next day nor the day after they had begun to feel that danger was not far away on
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:01.600]   either side they camped under the stars and their horses had more to eat than they had for there
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:06.800]   was plenty of grass but there was not much in their bags even with what they had got from the trolls
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:13.840]   one morning they folded a river at a wide shallow place full of the noise of stones and foam
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:19.680]   the far bank was steep and slippery when they got to the top of it leading their ponies they saw
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:25.520]   that the great mountains had marched down very near to them already they seen only a days easy
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:32.480]   journey from the feet of the nearest dark and rear it looked though there were patches of sunlight
[01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:42.800]   on its brown sides and behind its shoulders the tips of snow peaks bleed is that the mountain
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:49.760]   us build on a solemn voice looking at it the round eyes he had never seen a thing that looked
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:57.760]   so big before of course not said by that is only the beginning of the misty mountains
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:03.440]   and we have got to get through or over or under though somehow before we can come mental
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:10.000]   will the land be on it is a deal of a way even from the other side of them to the lonely mountain
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:18.080]   and the east where small lies on our treasure oh said Bilbo and just at that moment he felt
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:24.400]   more tired than he ever remembered feeling before he was thinking once again of his comfortable chair
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:31.200]   before the fire in his favorite sitting room in his hobbit hall and of the kettle singing not to the
[01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:39.680]   last time now Gandalf led the way we must not miss the road or we should be done for he said we
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:46.400]   need food for one thing and rest in reasonable safety also it is very necessary to tackle the
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:52.400]   misty mountains by the proper path or else you will get lost in them and have to come back and
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:59.120]   start at the beginning again if you ever get back at all they asked him where he was making for
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:05.440]   and he answered you are come to the very edge of the wild some of you may know hidden somewhere ahead
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:12.800]   of us is the fair valley of river no where El Rond lives in the last homely house I sent a message
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:19.680]   by my friends and we are expected that sound in nice and comforting but they had not got there
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:24.800]   yet and it was not so easy as it sounds to find that last homey house west of the mountains
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:30.960]   there seemed to be no trees and no valley and no hills to break the ground in front of them
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:37.120]   only one vast slope going slowly up and up to meet the feet of the nearest mountain
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:43.760]   wide land the color of heather and crumbling rock with patches and slashes of grass green
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:52.880]   and moss green showing where water might be morning past afternoon came but in all the silent waste
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:59.200]   there was no sign of any dwelling they were growing anxious for they saw now that the house
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:06.160]   might be hidden almost anywhere between them and the mountains they came on unexpected valleys
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:12.240]   narrow with steep sides that opened suddenly at their feet and they looked down surprised to see
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:18.720]   trees below them and running water at the bottom there were gullies that they could almost leap over
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:24.880]   but very deep with waterfalls in them there were dark ravines that one could neither jump over
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:30.960]   nor climb into there were bogs some of them green pleasant places to look at with flowers growing
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:36.320]   bright and tall but a pony that walked there with a pack on its back would never have come out again
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:44.720]   it was indeed a much wider land from the fort and the mountains than ever you would have guessed
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:50.960]   Bilbo was astonished the only path was marked with white stones some of which were small the
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:57.040]   others were half covered with moss or heather all together it was a very slow business following
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:01.680]   the track even guided by Gandalf who seemed to know his way about pretty well
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:07.680]   his head and beard wagged this way and that as he looked for the stones and they followed
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:12.880]   his lead but they seemed no nearer to the end of the search when the day began to fail
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:19.120]   tea time had long gone by and it seemed suppertime would soon do the same
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:26.640]   there were moths fluttering about and the light became very dim for the moon had not risen
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:33.440]   Bilbo's pony began to stumble over roots and stones they came to the edge of a steep fall
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:40.400]   in the ground so suddenly that Gandalf's horse nearly slipped down the slope here it is at last
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:48.960]   called and the others gathered round him and looked over the edge they saw a valley far below
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:54.080]   they could hear the voice of hurrying water in a rocky bed at the bottom the scent of trees was
[01:31:54.080 --> 01:32:01.520]   in the air and there was a light on the valley side across the water Bilbo never forgot the way
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:07.840]   they slivered and slipped in the dusk down the steep zigzag path into the secret valley of Rivendell
[01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:14.640]   the air grew warmer as they got lower and the smell of the pine trees made him drowsy
[01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:19.760]   so that every now and again he nodded and nearly fell off or bumped his nose on the pony's neck
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:26.880]   their spirits rose as they went down and down the trees changed to beach and oak
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:34.000]   and there was a comfortable feeling in the twilight the last green had almost faded out of the grass
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.680]   when they came at length to an open glade not far above the banks of the stream
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:50.880]   smells like elves thought Bilbo and he looked up at the stars they were burning bright and blue
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:58.480]   just then they came a burst of song like laughter in the trees
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:05.280]   oh what are you doing and where are you going your ponies need shoeing the river is flowing
[01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:11.680]   or tralelele here down in the valley oh what are you seeking and what are you making the
[01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:18.320]   faggots are wreaking the banox are baking oh tralelelelele the valley is jolly ha ha
[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:25.840]   oh where are you going with beards all are wagging no knowing no knowing what brings mr.
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:31.520]   baggins and ballon and wellen down into the valley in june ha ha
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:38.960]   oh will you be staying or will you be flying your ponies are straying and daylight is dying
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:47.600]   to fly would be folly to stay would be jolly and listen and hark till the end of the
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:57.680]   dog to a tune oh so they laughed and sang in the trees and pretty fair nonsense i dare say you
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:03.920]   think not that they would care they would only laugh all the more if you told them so they were
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:12.080]   elves of course soon Bilbo caught glimpses of them as the darkness deep and he loved elves
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:19.200]   though he seldom met them but he was a little frightened of them too dwarves don't get on well with them
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:24.160]   even decent enough dwarves like thorin and his friends think them foolish which is a very foolish
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:30.000]   thing to think or get annoyed with them for some elves tease them and laugh at them and most of
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:39.040]   all at their beards well well said a voice just look Bilbo the hobbit on a pony my dear isn't
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:47.520]   delicious most astonishing wonderful that off they went into another song as ridiculous as the one I
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:55.440]   had written down in full at last one a tall young fellow came out from the trees and bowed to
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:35:04.240]   Gandalf and to thorin welcome to the valley he said thank you said thorin a bit gruffly but Gandalf
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:10.560]   was already off his horse and among the elves talking merrily with them you are a little out of your way
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:15.680]   said the elf that is if you are making for the only path across the water and to the house beyond
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:22.640]   we will set you right but you had best get on foot until you are over the bridge are you going to
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:28.800]   stay a bit and sing with us or will you go straight on supper is preparing over there you said
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:36.080]   I can smell the wood fires for the cooking tired as he was Bilbo would have liked to stay a while
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:43.360]   elvish singing is not a thing to miss in june under the stars not if you care for such things
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:48.320]   also he would have liked to have a few private words with these people that seem to know his
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:54.240]   names and all about him although he had never seen him before he thought their opinion of his
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:36:01.920]   adventure might be interesting elves know a lot and are wondrous folk for news and know what is going
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:08.240]   on among the peoples of the land as quick as water flows or quicker but the dwarves were all
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:14.400]   for supper as soon as possible to stand and would not stay on they all went leading their ponies
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:20.480]   till they were brought to a good path and so at last the very brink of the river it was flowing
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:27.120]   fast and noisily as mountain streams do of a summer evening when sun has been all day on the snow far
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:34.240]   up above there was only a narrow bridge of stone without a parapet as narrow as a pony could well
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:42.240]   walk on and over that they had to go slow and careful one by one each leading his pony by the
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:49.280]   bridal the elves had brought bright lanterns to the shore and they sang a merry song as a party when
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:57.280]   to cross don't dip your beard in the foam father they cried to thorrin who was bent almost onto his hands
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:04.240]   and knees it is long enough without watering it mind Bilbo doesn't eat all the cakes they called
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:12.320]   he is too fat to get through key holes yet hush hush good people and good night said young elf who
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:22.800]   came last valleys have ears and some elves have over merry tongues good night and so at last they
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:30.800]   all came to the last homely house and found its doors flung wide now it is a strange thing but
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:37.040]   think that a good to have and days that a good to spend are soon told about and not much to listen
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:43.920]   to while things that are uncomfortable palpitating and even gruesome may make a good tale and
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:51.600]   take a deal of telling anyway they stayed long in that good house 14 days at least and they found
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:58.080]   it hard to leave Bilbo would gladly stop there forever and ever even supposing a wish would have
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:03.600]   taken him right back to his hobby a whole without trouble yet there is little to tell about their
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:10.240]   yesterday the master of the house was an elf friend one of those people whose fathers came into the
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:15.680]   strange stories before the beginning of history the wars of the evil goblins and the elves and the
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:22.240]   first men in the north in those days of our tale there were still some people who had both elves
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:28.640]   and heroes of the north for ancestors and Elrond the master of the house was their chief
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:38.240]   he was as noble and as fair in face as an elf lord a strong as a warrior as wise as a wizard
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:46.640]   as venerable as a king of dwarves and as kind as summer he comes into many tales but his part
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:52.560]   in the story of Bilbo's great adventure is only a small though important as you will see if we ever
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:39:02.400]   get to the end of it his house was perfect whether you liked food or sleep or work or story telling
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:10.800]   or singing or just sitting and thinking best or a pleasant mixture of them all evil things did not
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:17.920]   come into that valley i wish i had time to tell you even a few of the tales or one of two of the
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:24.480]   songs that they heard in that house all of them the ponies as well grew refreshed and strong in a
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:30.000]   few days there the clothes were mended as well as their bruises their tempers and their hopes
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:36.240]   their bags were filled with food and provisions light to carry but strong to bring them over the
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:42.400]   mountain passes their plans were improved with the best advice so the time came to mid summer
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:50.320]   and they were to go on again with the early sun on mid summer morning Elrond knew all about
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:56.000]   runes of every kind that day he looked at the swords they had brought from the trolls lair and he
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:06.880]   said these are not trolmick they are old swords very old swords of the high elves of the west
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:14.960]   my kin they were made in gondolin for the goblin wars they must have come from a dragon's horde
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:20.080]   or goblin plunder for dragons and the goblins destroyed that city many ages ago
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:29.680]   this for it the runes name or christ the goblin cleaver in the ancient tongue of gondolin
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:40.240]   it was a famous blade this gandalf was gloundering fo hammer that the king of gondolin once wore
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:42.320]   keep them well
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:49.600]   whence did the trolls get them i wonder said thor it looking at his sword with new interest
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:57.360]   i could not say said Elrond but one may guess that your trolls had plundered other plunderers
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:01.840]   or come on the remnants of all robberies in some hole in the mountains of all
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:09.360]   i have heard that there are still forgotten traders to be found in the deserted caverns of the
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:17.200]   minds of moria since the dwarf and goblin war thor it pondered these words i will keep this
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:22.640]   sword in honor he said may his soon cleave goblin this once again
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:31.440]   a wish that is likely to be granted soon enough in the mountains said el one but show me now your map
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:38.640]   he took it and gazed long at it and he shook his head for if he did not all together approve of
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:45.040]   dwarves and their love of gold he hated dragons and their cruel wickedness and he grieved to
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:50.480]   remember the ruin of the town of dale and its merry bells and the burnt banks of the bright river
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:59.920]   running the moon was shining in a broad silver crescent he held up the map and the white light shone
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:08.720]   through it what is this he said there are moon letters here beside the plain runes which say
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:16.400]   five feet high the door and three may walk abreast and what a moon letters asked the hobbit
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:22.400]   full of excitement he loved maps as i have told you before and he also like rooms and letters
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:26.880]   and cunning handwriting though when he wrote himself it was a bit thin and spidery
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:35.520]   moon letters are room letters but you cannot see them said el one not when you look straight at them
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:40.880]   they can only be seen when the moon shines behind them and what is more
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:47.760]   with the more cunning sword it must be a moon of the same shape and season as the day when they were written
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:53.600]   the dwarves invented them and wrote them with silver pens as your friends could tell you
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:43:00.400]   these must have been written on a midsummer's eve in a crescent moon a long while ago
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:07.760]   what do they say asked Gandalf and Thorin together a bit vexed perhaps that even Elrond
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:12.880]   should have found this out first the really there had not been a chance before and there would
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:15.200]   not have been another until goodness knows when
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:26.320]   stand by the grace stone when the thrush knocks red Elrond and the setting sun with the last light
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:36.880]   of daurin's day will shine upon the keel daurin daurin said thaurin he was the father of the fathers of
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:42.160]   the eldest race of dwarves the long beards and my first ancestor i am his heir
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:50.400]   then what is daurin's day the first day of the dwarves new year said thaurin
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:54.800]   it is as all should know the first day of the last moon of autumn on the threshold of winter
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:44:02.320]   we still call it daurin's day when the last moon of autumn and the sun are in the sky together
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:08.640]   but this will not help as much affair for it passes our skill in these days to guess when such a time
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:18.080]   will come again that remains to be seen said Gandalf is there any more writing none to be seen
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:25.440]   by this moon said Elrond and he gave the map back to thaurin and then they went down to the water
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:33.360]   to see the elves dance and sing upon the midsummer's eve the next morning was a midsummer's
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:41.920]   morning as fair and fresh as could be dreamt blue sky and never a cloud and the sun dancing on
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:48.880]   the water now they rode away amid songs of farewell and good speed with their hearts ready
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:54.160]   for more adventure and with the knowledge of the road they must follow over the misty mountains
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:45:07.600]   to the land beyond chapter four over hill and under hill there were many paths that led up into
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:13.200]   those mountains and many passes over them but most of the paths were cheats and deceptions
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:20.720]   and led nowhere or to bad ends and most of the passes were infested by evil things and dreadful
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:28.480]   dangers the dwarfs and the hobbit helped by the wise advice of Elrond and the knowledge and memory
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:36.080]   of Gandalf took the right road to the right pass long days after they had climbed out of the valley
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:45.360]   and left the last homely house miles behind they were still going up and up and up it was a hard path
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:53.440]   and a dangerous path a crooked way and a lonely and a long now they could look back over the
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:46:01.120]   lands they had left laid out behind them far below far far away in the west where things were blue
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:09.840]   and faint build a new their lay his own country of safe and comfortable things and his little hobbit
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:17.120]   hole he shivered it was getting bitter cold up here and the wind came shrill among the rocks
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:23.520]   bolders too at times came galloping down the mountainsides let loose by midday sign upon the snow
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:30.080]   and passed among them which was lucky or over their heads which was alarming the nights were
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:38.800]   comfortless and chill and they did not dare to sing or talk too loud for the echoes were uncanny
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:44.640]   and the silence seemed to dislike being broken except by the noise of water on the wail of wind and the
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:51.360]   crack of stone the summer is getting on down below thought below and he making is going on and
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:57.520]   pic mix they will be harvesting and blackberry before we even begin to go down the other side
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:02.640]   at this rate and the others were thinking equally gloomy thoughts although when they had said
[01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:08.000]   goodbye to Elrond in the high hope of a mid summer morning they had spoken gaily of the passage of
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:15.440]   the mountains and a riding swift across the lands beyond they had thought of coming to the secret
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:22.400]   door in the lonely mountain perhaps that very next moon of autumn and perhaps it will be during
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:28.960]   the day he had said only Gandalf for shaking his head and said nothing doors had not passed that
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:36.560]   way for many years but Gandalf had and he knew how evil and danger had grown and thriven in the
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:41.760]   wild since the dragons had driven men from the lands and the goblins had spread in secret after the
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:48.320]   battle of the mines of Moria even the good plans of wise wizards like Gandalf and of good friends
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:54.240]   like Elrond go astray sometimes when you are off on dangerous adventures over the edge of the wild
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:48:01.440]   and Gandalf was a wise enough wizard to know he knew something unexpected might happen
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:06.800]   and he hardly dared to hope that they would pass without fearful adventure over those great tall
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:15.920]   mountains with lonely peaks and valleys where no king ruled they did not all was well until one day
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:24.880]   they met a thunderstorm more than a thunderstorm a thunder battle you know how terrific a really
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:30.400]   big thunderstorm can be down in the land and in a river valley especially at times when two great
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:38.000]   thunderstorms meet and clash more terrible still are thunder and lightning in the mountains at night
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:45.200]   when storms come up from east and west and make war the lightning splinters on the peaks and
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:51.760]   rock shiver and great crashes split the air and go rolling and tumbling into every cave and hollow
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:57.360]   and the darkness is filled with overwhelming noise and sudden light
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:03.840]   Bilbo had never seen or imagined anything of the kind they were high up in a narrow place
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:09.600]   with a dreadful fall into a dim valley at one side of them there they were sheltering under a
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:14.960]   hanging rock for the night and he lay beneath a blanket and shook from head to toe when he
[01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:22.560]   peeped out in the lightning flashes he saw that across the valley the stone giants were out
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:27.600]   and were hurling rocks at one another for a game and catching them and tossing them down into
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:33.200]   the darkness where they smashed among the trees far below or splintered into little bits with a bang
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:40.640]   then came a wind and a rain and the wind whipped the rain and the hail about in every direction
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:46.160]   so that an overhanging rock was no protection at all soon they were getting drenched and their
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:51.280]   ponies were standing with their heads down and their tails between their legs and some of them were
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:58.080]   winning with fright they could hear the giants gawforing and shouting all over the mountainsides
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:05.680]   "This won't do at all," said Thorin, "if you don't get blown off or drowned or struck by lightning
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:09.920]   we shall be picked up by some giant and kicked sky high for a football."
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:16.400]   "Well, if you know of anywhere better take us there," said Gandalf who was feeling very grumpy
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:18.720]   and was far from happy about the giants himself.
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:24.960]   The end of their argument was that they sent Philly and Killie to look for a better shelter.
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:30.720]   They had very sharp eyes and being the youngest of the dwarves by some 50 years they usually got
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:35.360]   these sort of jobs when everybody could see that it was absolutely no use sending Bilbo.
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:42.080]   "There is nothing like looking if you want to find something," or so Thorin said to the young dwarves,
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:47.120]   "you certainly usually find something if you look but it is not always quite the something
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:50.400]   you are after, so it proved on this occasion."
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:57.120]   "Soon Philly and Killie came crawling back holding onto the rocks in the wind."
[01:50:57.120 --> 01:51:03.360]   "We found a dry cave," they said, "not far around the next corner and ponies and all get inside."
[01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:09.520]   "Have you thoroughly explored it?" said the wizard, "who knew that caves up in the mountains
[01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:16.000]   were seldom unoccupied?" "Yes, yes," they said, "though everybody knew they could not have been
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:21.600]   long about it, they had come back too quick." "It isn't all that big and it does not go far back."
[01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:29.120]   "That, of course, is the dangerous part about caves. You don't know how far they go back,
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:35.040]   sometimes or where a passage behind may lead to or what is waiting for you inside."
[01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:41.760]   "But now Philly and Killie's news seemed good enough, so they all got up and prepared to move.
[01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:47.200]   The wind was howling and the thunder still growling and they had a business getting themselves
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:53.680]   and their ponies along. Still, it was not very far to go and before long they came to a big
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:52:00.080]   rock standing out into the path. If you stepped behind, you found a low arch in the side of the
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:06.000]   mountain. There was just room to get the ponies through with a squeeze when they had been unpacked
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:12.400]   and unsettled. As they passed under the arch it was good to hear the wind and the rain outside,
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:18.240]   instead of all about them, and to feel safe from the giants in their rocks. But the wizard was
[01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:25.760]   taking no risks. He lit up his one. As he did that day in Bilbo's dining room that seemed
[01:52:25.760 --> 01:52:32.560]   so long ago, if you remember. And by its light they explored the cave from end to end.
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:40.000]   It seemed quite a fair size, but not too large and mysterious. He had a dry floor and some comfortable
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:46.320]   nooks. At one end there was room for the ponies, and there they stood. Might he go ahead of the
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:52.640]   change, steaming and chimping in their nose backs. Owen and glowing wanted to light a fire
[01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:57.200]   at the door to dry their clothes, but Gandalf would not hear of it, so they spread out their wet
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:02.560]   things on the floor and got dry ones out of their bundles. Then they made their blankets comfortable,
[01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:07.760]   got out their pipes and blue smoke rings, which Gandalf turned into different colours and set
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:14.720]   dancing up by the roof to amuse them. They talked and talked and forgot about the storm and discussed
[01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:19.920]   what each would do with his share of the treasure when they got it, which at the moment did not
[01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:26.960]   seem so impossible. And so they dropped off to sleep one by one. And that was the last time
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:33.760]   that they used the ponies, packages, baggages, tools and paraphernalia that they had brought with them.
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:39.520]   It turned out a good thing that night that they had brought little Bilbo with them after all.
[01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:45.520]   For some how he could not go to sleep for a long while and when he did sleep, he had very nasty
[01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:52.400]   dreams. He dreamt that a crack in the wall at the back of the cave got bigger and bigger and opened
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:57.840]   wider and wider and he was very afraid but could not call out or do anything but lie and look.
[01:53:57.840 --> 01:54:05.200]   Then he dreamt that the floor of the cave was giving away and he was slipping, beginning to fall
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:13.360]   down, down, goodness knows where to. At that he woke up with a horrible start and found that part
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:19.760]   of his dream was true. A crack had opened at the back of the cave and was already a wide passage,
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:23.440]   he was just in time to see the last of the ponies tales disappearing into it.
[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:29.600]   Of course he gave a very loud yell as loud a yell as a hobbit can give which is surprising for
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:37.600]   their size. Out jumped the goblins. Big goblins, great ugly looking goblins, lots of goblins before
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:43.280]   you could say rocks and blocks. There were six to each dwarf at least and two even for Bilbo
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:48.320]   and they were all grabbed and carried through the crack before you could say tinder and flint.
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:55.600]   But not Gandalf. Bilbo's yell had done that much good. It had awakened him up wide in a splintered
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:00.480]   second and when goblins came to grab him there was a terrific flash like lightning in the cave, a
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:07.680]   smell like gum powder and several of them filled it. The crack closed with a snap and Bilbo
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:13.040]   and the dwarves were on the wrong side of it where it was Gandalf. Of that neither they nor the
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:18.000]   goblins had any idea and the goblins did not wait to find out. They seized Bilbo and the dwarves
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:24.400]   and hurried them along. It was deep, deep, dark, such as only goblins that have taken to living in the
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:30.480]   heart of the mountains can see through. The passages there were crossed and tangled in all directions
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:36.800]   but the goblins knew their way as well as you do to the nearest post office and the way
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:43.280]   went down and down and it was most horribly stuffy. The goblins were very rough and pinched
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:49.680]   unmercifully and chuckled and laughed in their horrible, stony voices and Bilbo was more unhappy
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:55.440]   even than when the troll had picked him up by his toes. He wished again and again for his
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:56:02.480]   nice bright hobbit hole and not for the last time. Now they came a glimmer of red light before them.
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:09.600]   The goblins began to sing or croak keeping time with the flap and their flat feet on the stone
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:17.440]   and shrieking their prisoners as well. Clap, snap, the black, crack, grip, grab, pinch,
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:27.760]   nab and down, down to goblin town you go. My lad, class, crash, crash, smash, hammer and tongs,
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:37.520]   knuckle and tongs, pound, pound, far underground, oh, oh, my lad, swish, smack, whip, crack,
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:44.400]   batter and beat, hammer and bleat, work, work, north, data, sugar, guag, goblins, quat,
[01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:53.920]   and goblins laugh round and round, far underground below, my lad. It sounded truly terrifying.
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:57:01.680]   The walls echo to the clap, snap and the crash, smash and to the ugly laughter of their hohoho,
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:09.040]   my lad. The general meaning of the song was only too plain, for now the goblins took out
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:15.360]   whips and whipped them with a swish, smack and set them running as fast as they could in front
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:20.640]   of them and more than one of the dwarves were already yammering and bleating like anything
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:28.480]   when they stumbled into a big cavern, it was lit by a great red fire in the middle and by torches along
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:36.080]   the walls and it was full of goblins. They all laughed and stamped and clapped their hands when
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:41.280]   the dwarves with Paul Bilbo at the back nearest to the whips came running in while the goblin
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:47.200]   drivers whooped and cracked their whips behind. The ponies were already there huddled in a corner
[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:54.000]   and there were all the baggages and packages lying broken open and being rummaged by goblins
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:58:01.920]   and smelt by goblins and fingered by goblins and quarreled over by goblins. I'm afraid that
[01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:08.480]   was the last they ever saw those excellent little ponies, including a jolly sturdy little white
[01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:13.760]   fellow that Elrond had lent to Gandalf since his horse was not suitable for the mountain paths.
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:22.080]   For goblins, eat horses and ponies and donkeys and other much more dreadful things
[01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:29.040]   and they are always hungry. Just now, however, the prisoners were thinking only of themselves.
[01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:33.600]   The goblins chained their hands behind their backs and linked them all together in a line and dragged
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:38.960]   them to the far end of the cavern with little Bilbo tugging at the end of the row.
[01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:49.200]   There, in the shadows on a large flatstone set a tremendous goblin with a huge head
[01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:54.880]   and armed goblins were standing round in carrying the axes and the bent swords that they use.
[01:58:54.880 --> 01:59:03.440]   Now, goblins are cruel, wicked and bad-hearted. They make no beautiful things, but they make many
[01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:09.840]   clever ones. They can tunnel and mine as well as any but the most skilled dwarves when they take
[01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:17.920]   the trouble, though they are usually untidy and dirty. Hammers, axes, swords, daggers, pickaxes,
[01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:23.920]   tongs and also instruments of torture they make very well or get other to make to their design,
[01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:28.480]   prisoners and slaves that have to work till they die for want of air and light.
[01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:35.280]   It is not unlikely that they invented some of the machines that have since troubled the world,
[01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:41.920]   especially the ingenious devices for killing large numbers of people at once,
[01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:48.880]   for wheels and engines and explosions always delighted them, and also not working with their own
[01:59:48.880 --> 01:59:56.720]   hands more than they could help. But in those days, and those wild paths, they had not advanced,
[01:59:56.720 --> 02:00:03.200]   as it is called, so far. They did not hate dwarves especially, no more than they hated

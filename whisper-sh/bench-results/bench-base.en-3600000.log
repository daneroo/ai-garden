[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.400]   The year 1144 of the Age of Exiles, Hound Moon.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.000]   There it is fell through the night air, waitless.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.200]   He caught glimpses of the tower of Brickhan.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.960]   Caledus is still smoldering outline at the window, then below, the river coming up to meet him.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.520]   He slammed into the water, the cold shocking the breath out of him.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.520]   He panicked, disorientated, realizing he didn't know which way was up.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.280]   All about him was darkness and ice.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.880]   Then something grabbed his hair, and he was surging upwards, breaking through the water
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.360]   in a burst of spray, and saw Alsion's pale broad phase staring back at him.
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.120]   "They will come hunting for us," the giant shouted over the roar of the river, as the
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.120]   current gripped them, sweeping them away from the thunder of warriors' feet crossing the
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.120]   bridge.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.760]   "Let the water take us far from them."
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.700]   Caledus saw the sense of that, though his hands and feet were already numbing from the
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.700]   cold.
[00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.800]   He put some effort into swimming, speeding his way from Brickhan, from Caledus, from the
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.160]   Khadashim.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.000]   The thought still jolted him like a blow.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.240]   They turned a bend in the river, and the fortress was gone, darkness enfolding them.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.160]   The soft weak sheen of dawn's gray light filtered down through the lattice of branches above,
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.760]   his varidus met Alsion's gaze, an unspoken agreement passing between them, as they both
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.560]   headed for the riverbank.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.960]   It was harder going, swimming across the current, and varidus realized how exhausted his body
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.440]   was, but eventually he felt silt beneath his feet, his hands grasping at reeds as he pulled
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.840]   himself out of the water and flopped onto his back, gasping, his limbs feeling lead-filled.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.680]   Turning, he saw Alsion on the bank, thirty or forty paces upriver from him, staggering
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.480]   wearily towards him before he slumped down beside him with a groan, water dripping from
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.680]   his drooping moustache.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.360]   "Thank you," Alsion said.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.160]   "For what?"
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.800]   "Everything, most of all, for helping my family escape Brickhan's dungeons."
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.320]   His wife and bear.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.240]   How long has he gone without seeing them?
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.080]   And what must he have suffered, knowing they were Caledus and Lycus' prisoners?
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:02.840]   And for destroying Caledus' effigy of me, Alsion continued, "You have set me free."
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.160]   He gave a shudder, followed by a smile, "A shadow is gone from my soul.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.840]   I feel reborn."
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.280]   "If you mean you feel weak as a newborn bear," Veridis muttered as he emptied his boot of
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.020]   water and tried to pull it back on, "then I feel the same."
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.840]   "That is not what I mean," the giant rumbled, regarding Veridis' with serious eyes.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.080]   "You set rainer and tame free, you set me free.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.760]   I owe you a debt beyond all imagining."
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.120]   "You're in no debt to me," Veridis said.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.280]   "I kicked the effigies into the fire on impulse, not really knowing what they were, or what
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.080]   power they held over you."
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.800]   But you suspected, "I," something that Fidele said.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.000]   He thought of Nathair's mother, hoped that she had made it to freedom along with his
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.520]   brother, Kralis, Maken and Albin.
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.200]   And your wife and son, I set them free because it was the right thing to do.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.000]   It was not the choice.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.800]   "Ah, but there was true heart, there always is."
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.800]   Veridis shrugged.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.760]   "There is no debt between us.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.440]   You are my friend."
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.880]   One of my only friends, it has turned out.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.640]   His thought swept bitterly to Nathair, and the confession and revelations that had stunned
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.920]   Veridis.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:45.660]   He remembered Calidus' confession, that Nathair had slain Aquilus, his own father.
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.040]   Anger and shame twisted through him.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.240]   "There have been so many signs.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.440]   How can I have been deceived for so long?
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.400]   I am a fool."
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.640]   "How long?"
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.880]   Veridis asked him.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.080]   "How long have you been Calidus' prisoner?"
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.380]   Alcyon smiled withered, "16 years."
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.920]   "That is a long time."
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:21.280]   "It is," Alcyon clenched his fists, knuckles cracking, "I should have killed him."
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.720]   "To be fair, we both tried hard on that count.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.920]   I put a knife in his belly, threw him in a fire, and he shattered his chest with a wall
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.920]   hammer."
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.620]   "Cadoshim are hard to kill."
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.360]   "I'd have to agree.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.560]   Can he be killed?"
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.160]   "Maybe taking his head.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.840]   That is how the others are slain."
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.840]   "Others?"
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.040]   "The Jihar.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.720]   They are demon possessed by Kadoshim.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.360]   At Murias."
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.800]   Alcyon said to the question in Veridis' eyes, "The Jihar."
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.800]   Veridis muttered.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.520]   Shaking his head, "I've been so blind."
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:12.320]   "You trusted your king and your friend," Alcyon shrugged, "there are worse failings
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.320]   to have."
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.160]   "Are there?"
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.480]   "I have dedicated my life to a lie."
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.800]   They both sat in silence, water dripping from clothes and hair.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.320]   "What now?"
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.960]   Veridis said to himself.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.360]   "It feels as if my whole life has been dedicated to an affair in his cause."
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.120]   "What do I do now?"
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.480]   Alcyon regarded him gravely, and poked his chest with a thick finger.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.000]   "What does your heart tell you?"
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.400]   "I will not trust it."
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.120]   "Look where it has led me thus far," Veridis said sourly.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.520]   "Your eyes are open now."
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.080]   Veridis sucked in a deep breath, felt exhaustion seeping through him.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.360]   "What would you do?"
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.080]   He asked the giant.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.880]   "Find my king, my reiner, and tain."
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.440]   He smiled as he said their names.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.440]   "Kyn?"
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.720]   "My father is slain, as is my brother Ector.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.280]   Only Krelis is left."
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.280]   Suddenly he was desperate to see his older brother.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:32.680]   "Find our kin," he echoed, "a good place to start."
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.120]   Something squawked, a handful of woodpigeons suddenly bursting from the trees and flapping
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.440]   noisily overhead.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.560]   "We should move."
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.040]   "We need cover."
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:48.240]   "I, to the trees," Veridis said, as he stood suppressing a groan.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.760]   They were half way across the clearing when Alcyon stopped abruptly, staring back along
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.560]   the riverbank.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.800]   Alcyon's appeared around a distant bend on the track, shadows in the half-light that
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.480]   fawns canopy created.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.920]   Black shadows with curved swords sheathed across their backs.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.360]   "Cada-shim," Alcyon growled.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.040]   Veridis counted at least seven of them, moving quickly, a loping, ground-eating pace like
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.400]   a pack of wolfen.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.200]   They were spread in a half-circle between the riverbank and the tree-line.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.800]   They are hunting us, have been running all night long following the river in search of
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.320]   our trail.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.460]   One of the figures paused, the others rippling to a halt about it.
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:39.720]   It lifted its head as if tasting the air, then gave an ululating howl and leapt forwards
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.120]   a new energy in its stride.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.720]   They've caught our scent.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.960]   Veridis felt a jolt of fear.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.400]   He'd faced giants, drags, warbands.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.200]   But somehow knowing that the demons of the other world were hunting him sent a cold shock
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.000]   of fear tingling through his veins.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.480]   "Cada-shim," Alcyon said, "my enemy."
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.000]   Alcyon filled his mind.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.560]   An image of the man he had thought counsellor and ally emerging from the fire in Brikan's
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.640]   tower, flame-reaved and snarling.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.200]   He has corrupted an affair and has deceived me for so long.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.880]   He is the author of this evil.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:30.080]   Fear morphed into a cold rage and he reached for his sword, lips twisting.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.120]   "Move," Alcyon grunted and broke into a run.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.760]   Veridis resisted for a moment, inexplicably wanting to stand and fight these creatures,
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:45.960]   but Alcyon dragged him along and in a heartbeat they were only a few strides from the tree-line.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.400]   He realised the giant had no weapon.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:54.040]   No Warhammer or battle act strapped across his back, no sword or dagger at his hip.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.400]   They crashed through the first layer of undergrowth and were immediately enveloped by a twilight
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.920]   world of shadow and thorn.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:08.240]   Alcyon forged ahead, grunting as branches snapped upon his rock-like torso, thorns whipping
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.840]   at Veridis, vines tangling about his boots.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.880]   It seemed a long time, Veridis only heard his own heart thumping the rasp of his breath,
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.160]   the thud of Alcyon's feet.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.240]   Then there were sounds behind him, faint at first, like the rustle of wind through foliage,
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:30.600]   but soon louder, keening cries were floating about him.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.800]   They splashed through a stream, something sinuous slithered beneath Veridis's feet, making
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.800]   him stumble.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.020]   "They're almost upon us," he gasped to Alcyon.
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.880]   Better to turn and fight, hold a sword in my fist than die running.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:51.600]   "I know," the giant said, turning, chest-heaving.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.240]   Veridis drew his sword as they put their backs to a huge tree, the stream before them, and
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.800]   waited.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:03.760]   Forms flitted through the gloom, emerging from a curtain of shadows and thick foliage.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:10.040]   One was a long way ahead of the others, clothed in the dark mail of the jihar, pale-skinned,
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.560]   dark veins making a tapestry of its flesh.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.840]   It saw them and leapt the stream, arms reaching for Veridis, not even bothering to draw its
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.840]   sword.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:26.800]   "Remember, you must take their heads," Alcyon grunted, as he pushed away from the tree,
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.280]   hurling himself into the oncoming countership with bone-crushing power.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.720]   The two fell to the ground.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.560]   Veridis hurtled forwards, sword-raised, hacking two-handed at the Khadashim's arm, its hand
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:44.680]   spinning away, blood-like oil pumping languidly from the stump, then the two forms were rolling
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.040]   together again.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:52.040]   Alcyon growled in pain, then he was on his knees, arms wrapped about the Khadashim's torso,
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.640]   pinning its arms at its side.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.520]   The creature's head writhed, veins bulging as it strained to break free, Alcyon's face
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.120]   turning purple with the effort, his locked fingers slowly pulling apart.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:11.920]   "What are you, waiting for?" the giant rasped, and Veridis swung his sword, chopping into
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.240]   the creature's neck.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:19.280]   Dark blood spurted from the half-severed neck, the Khadashim screeching with fury, Alcyon
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.640]   roared with the strain of holding the creature.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.680]   Veridis wrenched his sword free, and swung again.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:31.960]   The Khadashim's head flew through the air, landing with a splash in the stream.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:37.720]   Its body slumped, legs drumming as Alcyon fell away and rolled clear.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:44.560]   A black, eye-core-like mist flowed from the Khadashim's neck, hissing and swirling, gathering
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.800]   above its body, forming a human shape with tattered wings of smoke spread about it, and
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.880]   red eyes glowing like coals at its heart.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.680]   Veridis stared.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:02.480]   It screamed savagely, then it was melting away, torn and dispersed by a slight breeze.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.040]   "What the hell?"
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:10.760]   Veridis gasped, "Down!" Alcyon yelled as he surged up from the ground, a fist slamming
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:17.040]   into the jaw of a leaping Khadashim, hurling it spinning into the undergrowth.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:23.440]   Almost as soon as it hit the ground, it was back on its feet, twisting like a feral cat.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.800]   Veridis hefted his sword, spread his legs to meet the impact and then something crunched
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.640]   into his side, sending him flying through the air another Khadashim's arms locked around
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.760]   his waist.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:40.200]   He caught a glimpse of Alcyon standing, Khadashim swarming upon him, then Veridis was slamming
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.600]   into the ground.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:47.240]   Pain exploded in his shoulder, and his sword skittered away.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:52.360]   He rolled, punched at his attacker, for a moment staring into its black, soulless eyes, then
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.520]   they were sliding into the stream, the Khadashim beneath him, his hands fastening about its
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:01.960]   neck, squeezing, seeking to crush the life from the black-eyed abomination.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:07.240]   It bucked and kicked like a wild stallion, thrashing a tempest amidst the stream water,
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.360]   but Veridis would not let go.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.920]   He felt its strength ebbing, some of its vitality fading, then hands gripped him from
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:21.600]   behind, dragging him backwards, his fingers slipping as he was hauled to the bank.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.960]   Veridi Khadashim stood over him, drawing its sword from its back as the one from the stream
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.360]   splashed into view.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:33.200]   He rolled and saw a handful of Khadashim circling Alcyon, who would fall into one knee, the giant
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.320]   bleeding from a dozen wounds.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.840]   Veridis tried to drag himself through the mud towards his friend.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.320]   Another Khadashim was held in Alcyon's arms, he had one hand gripping its jaw, the other
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.920]   wrapped about its chest.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:52.040]   With a savage wrench, Alcyon heaved, Veridis heard the Khadashim's neck break, then the
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.880]   sound of flesh tearing, Alcyon screaming his defiance as he ripped the Khadashim's head
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.240]   from its shoulders.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:05.360]   He flung the corpse to the ground as the black mist boiled from the dead creatures wound.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:11.960]   A searing pain lanced through Veridis's leg, a Khadashim blade scoring along his thigh.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.160]   He dropped to the ground, looked back at the two Khadashim on the stream bank.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.400]   They were following him, toying with him.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.880]   The one with the drawn sword slashed his blade across Veridis's upheld forearm, a new cut
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.520]   burning like fire.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:33.320]   "Think will bleed you a while," the Khadashim said, leering with pale lips.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.880]   "Pay you back for the chase you've led us."
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.080]   It should not end like this.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.680]   Frustration gave Veridis a last surge of strength, and he rolled to his feet, pushed
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.120]   himself upright.
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:54.680]   The Khadashim before him grinned, then paused, cocking its head to one side.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.960]   Figures burst out of the gloom.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.060]   Veridis's hopes rose and then fell as he saw the newcomers were dressed in black breast
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:04.800]   plates with silver eagles on their chests.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.040]   Eagle guard.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:10.400]   No doubt sent by Nefair to make sure that his monsters complete their task.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:17.680]   Ten, twelve, fifteen more men, one of them tall and wide.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.960]   Veridis blinked, something familiar.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:27.880]   Well met, little brother, the big man bellowed, grinning wildly.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:34.680]   A moment's confusion followed swiftly by elation, "Krellis!"
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.680]   Then Krellis and his men were attacking the Khadashim, Krellis taking her head in one
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.360]   great swing of his longsword.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.200]   Another warrior swept into view.
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:49.160]   This one not dressed as a man of tenor brow, but gripping a knife in each hand.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:54.880]   He joined Krellis, and together they attacked the Khadashim before Veridis.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:00.760]   McKean and Krellis.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:05.920]   Chapter 2 Nefair.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:12.200]   Nefair stood in the great hall of Drasil and stared at the giant skeleton on its throne.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:18.720]   The bones of the ribcage surrounded a thick shafted spear, the wood, dark and pale vained,
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:25.760]   only a hint of black iron of the blade visible, the rest buried in the great tree of Drasil.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:32.600]   So that is scald, high king of the giants, and that is the starstone spear.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:40.820]   Scald, the last man to rule a united empire where giants and men live together in peace.
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:44.040]   Will I be the next to unite this shattered world?
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:50.240]   The skeleton was mottled yellow and brown, ancient, the brow of the skull broad and thick
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:55.360]   eye sockets, black holes that seemed to stare at Nefair, questioning him.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.600]   Are you worthy?
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.040]   Are you capable?
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:07.800]   Besides, history shall be my judge, nothing and no one else.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:16.280]   The hand touched his shoulder, Caesus was standing at the head of three-score eagle-guard.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:20.520]   The young warrior had been recently promoted to high captain of the fair's war-band, now
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:30.600]   that Veridis was gone, ah, Veridis, are you dead or alive, old friend?
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:36.080]   It does not seem right that you are not beside me to share in this great victory.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.800]   He had been informed of Veridis's betrayal, his attempt on Caledus's life, and he and
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.040]   Althian's escape.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:49.960]   Veridis, how could you abandon me, break your oath to me?
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:54.400]   He looked at the white scars on the palm of his hand, one of them made as a blood oath
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:00.080]   of brotherhood to Veridis on a moonlit hillside in Tenebrel.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:05.560]   It felt like a lot of time ago, words and promises spoken by different people.
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:10.760]   "My king," Caesus said, "it is Caledus."
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.840]   He asks for you.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:18.440]   Nefair looked back at the skeleton one last time, then turned and strode through the huge
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.680]   chamber.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:25.160]   The dead were still being cleared from the battle of the day before.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:33.800]   But staying the stone floor, mounds of corpses lay in stinking piles, hundreds of them—Caddishim,
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:40.600]   Jihar, Vinthalan, Eagleguard, Benothi giants, many others.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:44.940]   The cost of taking Drassil had been high, higher than he would have imagined considering
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.720]   that the element of surprise had been on their side.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:53.160]   But victory is victory.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:58.500]   The fortress is ours, the back of our enemy, broken.
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:04.000]   Though many had escaped, reports were coming in of pitched battles still being fought beyond
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.600]   the walls of Drassil.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:11.360]   Nefair glanced at his right as he passed an open trap-door as wide as the gates of Jerelin,
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:15.400]   and the dark stain of blood on the stone before it.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.040]   Mycals blood.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:22.960]   The Ben Ellim's head, now adorned a spear set in the ground of the courtyard before the
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.360]   gates of Drassil.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.800]   It was not alone.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.840]   But what of Corbin, their bright star?
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.880]   Where is he?
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.880]   He glared mistrustfully into the yawning dark of the tunnel, knew then Michael had chosen
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:42.160]   to stand and fight there to gain time for many who escaped into the tunnel.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.760]   Was Corbin one of them?
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.980]   There had been no reports of Corbin being seen during the battle.
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.080]   Had he even been here?
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:55.400]   It had been a long night, and Nefair felt a greater weariness settling upon him than
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.320]   he had ever known before.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.720]   Sazer snapped an order behind him, an eagle guard spread to either side, forming a protective
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.720]   column.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:11.720]   "Drassil is not yet secure," Sazer said, in replying to Nefair's inquiring look.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.200]   The courtyard also bore the signs of yesterday's battle.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:21.880]   Bodies scattered all about flies buzzing, the Metallica Roma of blood everywhere.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:27.320]   For an instant, Nefair thought he saw a wolf in cub tugging at the leg of a dead caddishim,
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.960]   but looking back realized it was a small white-furred dog.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:36.600]   They turned a corner in a street, and Nefair glimpsed the towering outer walls of Drassil
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:41.640]   beyond the layers of stone buildings latticed with thick branches.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.800]   This is a truly remarkable place.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.360]   Branches soared above him as thick as towers, with buildings of stone and iron wrapped about
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.960]   them bound tighter than leather armour.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.720]   It looks almost alive.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:02.920]   The tree, the bones, the fortress, its flesh.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.320]   The rasp of a sword drawn from its scabbard drew his attention, and he glimpsed the black
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.480]   clothed warrior hurtling from the shadows of a doorway.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:17.320]   Abruptly, Sazer's was yelling as more dark figures emerged, iron glinting.
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:23.880]   The eagle guard moved, shields thudding together around the fair obscuring his view.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:28.880]   Blood sprayed, spattering Nefair's face as an eagle guard before him collapsed.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:34.160]   A black clothed jihar slipped into the gap carved in the shield wall, surging towards
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.160]   Nefair.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:42.000]   Nefair drew his sword, fear and rage, his constant companions, igniting within him.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.760]   The shouts and screams are battle faded, his world contracting to the jihar warrior before
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.760]   him.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:53.120]   A woman, her dark-skinned face all sharp bones, almost fragile looking.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:23:00.320]   "Truth and courage!" she yelled, curved sword rising.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:04.840]   There was an explosion of sparks as their weapons met, the power of the jihar's strike making
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:10.920]   the tendons of his wrist shriek, shuddering on into his arm and shoulder.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:16.620]   He pushed forwards, knowing to retreat was to die, tried to move within her guard, use
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:20.480]   his short sword where her longer blade would hinder her.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:26.200]   They collided, limbs tangling as both crashed to the ground, wrestling, punching, kicking
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.120]   and biting at each other as they rolled back and forth across the stone street with a battle
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.080]   raging all about them.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:37.960]   The jihar struck a glancing blow that made his vision blur, then her knee crunched into
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:43.160]   his groin and he slumped, pain exploding, pulsing through him in savage waves, draining
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.440]   his strength.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:49.960]   She pulled herself free and half-rode as he coughed into the cold stone, tried to rise,
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:53.920]   knew if he didn't, he was dead.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:58.800]   Fear and rage sparked inside him, sent new energy coursing through his veins.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.120]   I'll not die here.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:08.400]   The jihar stood over him, sword raised, her eyes bright with victory.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:12.400]   Then a form crashed into her, throwing her to the ground.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:18.600]   She started to rise and a boot slammed into her jaw, sent her crashing back down.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:23.480]   The figure was blurred, a buzzing cloud swirling about it.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.500]   Hands gripped him and pulled him upright, says as his concerned face appeared, blood
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:31.380]   sheeting from a long cut across his forehead.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:35.140]   Nithair looked past him, saw his rescuer pull a sword from a scabbard upon its back and
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.900]   raised it over the unconscious jihar.
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.300]   "A kaddishim."
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.300]   "No!"
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.220]   Nithair called.
[00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:46.860]   The figure's head turned to look at him, the buzzing cloud parting.
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:52.220]   "Flies," Nithair realized, recognizing the kaddishim.
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.340]   "No, Legion.
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.100]   I want her alive."
[00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:01.020]   The kaddishim regarded him for a moment with cold black eyes.
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.940]   "Better, dead," it said.
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:08.260]   "I want her alive," Nithair snapped.
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.780]   "Kaddishim just may have questions."
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:18.180]   "Dead, after then," the kaddishim said, then sheathing its sword.
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:22.460]   "Kaddishim just wants you."
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:27.060]   The flesh of its face and neck rippled, seeming to move of its own accord as if some
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.820]   something were locked within, trying to get out.
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:34.500]   About them, the battle seemed almost done.
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:39.940]   Nithair scanned the street, counted nearly a score of his eagle guard dead to five or
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.420]   six of their jihar attackers.
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:46.700]   "This part of Drassel is supposed to have been cleared," he snarled.
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.900]   "How did they get in here?"
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:53.020]   He looked down at the unconscious jihar's form at Legion's feet.
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:58.020]   "Bring her," Nithair said, as he marched away.
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:03.500]   As Nithair entered the courtyard before Drassel's gates, he heard a rumbling growl reverberate
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:07.020]   from one of the many stables that edged the courtyard.
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:11.180]   He looked fondly at the doors that contained his drag.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:15.940]   Kallida stood before the closed gates of Drassel to either side of him were a host of spears
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:20.660]   driven into the ground, most of them adorned with a head.
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:25.460]   Their handful of Vinfalan warriors were planting new spears into the ground while behind them
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:29.700]   Kalishim prowled into the courtyard's shadows.
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:36.340]   Before Kallida snelt a ragged group of people, bound at wrist and ankle, over 300 prisoners
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.980]   from yesterday's battle.
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.380]   Above them, eagle guards stood upon Drassel's walls.
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.740]   My warriors.
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:50.420]   They were easily the best disciplined troops amongst those that had stormed Drassel.
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:55.620]   The Kallida and many of Lycus's Vinfalan were involved in the pursuit of their scattered
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:27:01.700]   enemy out beyond Drassel's walls, but Nithair suspected that most by far were ranging throughout
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:05.340]   the forest, looting and drinking.
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:10.340]   The Kallida and other things, such as eating their victims.
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.900]   Lycus was standing behind Kalishis.
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:19.740]   A dozen Vinfalan ranged about him, hard-looking men, bodies lean and muscular, skin, weathered
[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.460]   and scarred.
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.540]   Lycus lifted a waterskin to his mouth and took a long drink.
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:30.140]   I'd wager it's not water that he's drinking.
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.100]   The Vinfalan saw him approaching and nodded, agreeating.
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:38.500]   Nithair hid his disgust, him and my mother.
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:43.180]   "Ah, Nithair," Kalishis said.
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:48.700]   He raised an eyebrow at the blood on Nithair's face, then saw Legion dragging the Jihar warrior
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.780]   across the courtyard by her ankle.
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:56.900]   "Kallida's?" Nithair said, with a dip of his head.
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:00.220]   His old counselor was not looking his best.
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:04.220]   Part of his face was burned charcoal black and peeling.
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:08.780]   Silver hair was growing in tufts from patches on his head, elsewhere singed to stubble or
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:09.940]   burned clear.
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:15.660]   "It would appear that the streets of Drassel are not yet cleared of our enemy," Nithair
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.460]   said sourly.
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:21.220]   As Legion dumped the Jihar warrior in front of Kalishis.
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:26.100]   She groaned, pushing herself to her knees as Legion's hand clamped on her shoulder,
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.100]   holding her before Kalishis.
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.800]   "What is your name, child?"
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:36.040]   Kalishis asked, regarding her with his cold eyes.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:40.180]   She spat blood at Kalishis' feet and glowed up at him.
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:46.100]   "Ilta," the Jihar said, "and I am no child."
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:52.500]   "Well, Ilta, I shall ask you the same question that I have just put to your comrades."
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.300]   "Where is Corbin?"
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:29:01.580]   "You will see him soon enough," a voice said from amongst the prisoners.
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.940]   "He will come for you."
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:09.660]   "And when he does," said Ilta, as she turned her head to look from Kalishis to Nithair
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:13.260]   and like us, "he will kill you all."
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:17.380]   "He is a boy, a puppet.
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:23.500]   Your ill master is already slain," Kalishis said angrily, sweeping her hand towards Michael's
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.500]   head.
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.420]   "You are wrong," Ilta said.
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:29.580]   "Corbin is our Lord.
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.820]   He slew your best, Sumor, in single combat.
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.220]   We all saw it.
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.820]   He will do the same to you."
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.620]   "Sumor," Kalishis frowned.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:44.500]   "I saw his head decorating your gates."
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.100]   Corbin killed him.
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:52.220]   The prisoners' voice called out again, one vaguely familiar to Nithair.
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:58.580]   The figure straightened amongst the captives, black hair hanging lank about her face.
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:02.820]   He took Sumor's head, and he will take yours, too.
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:06.460]   "Ah, Cohen.
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:12.020]   I want nothing more than for him to come and try," Kalishis said with a sigh, his expression
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:16.100]   mocking, but Nithair limped something else in his eyes.
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:17.100]   "Doubt?"
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:24.260]   "But so far, he does not seem inclined to do so," Kalishis continued.
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:28.660]   "Perhaps a message will speed him to us."
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.540]   He looked to the Calichim.
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:38.140]   "Legion, choose one prisoner, and impale them upon a spear," he ordered.
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:43.780]   Legion drabs Cohen and pulled her, struggling towards a spear, "not her," Kalishis said,
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:46.660]   with a wave of his hand.
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:48.940]   Legion grabbed another prisoner.
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:52.100]   He was a man of isyltyred by the look of him.
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:56.380]   The Calichim hoisted him effortlessly into the air and brought him down slowly upon the
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:59.180]   upright spear.
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:02.120]   Then the screaming began.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:08.620]   When it was over, the prisoner was skewered like a squirrel, ready for the cookfire.
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:13.980]   He was writhing upon the spear, blood pooling about his feet, screaming himself to oblivion.
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:17.580]   Nithair resisted the urge to cover his ears.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:24.580]   "On your feet," Kalishis said to Ilta, "Go and tell Korriban what is happening to
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:32.260]   his followers what I am doing. Tell him I will not stop until he has faced me."
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:37.860]   Legion pushed her stumbling forwards as, with a rumble, the gates opened.
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:43.980]   She looked back once, and then ran, the gates slamming behind her.
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:48.460]   Calidas barked in order and the remaining captives were led away.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:53.980]   Cohen caught Nithair's eye as she walked in line, hatred pouring from her.
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:57.660]   "He must talk soon," Kalidas said to Nithair and Lycos.
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:01.980]   "Hi, son, in the great hall."
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.660]   Then he was striding away.
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.900]   Lycos raised an eyebrow and offered Nithair his water-skin.
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:13.940]   Without thinking, Nithair took it and drank, then coughed, almost choking on the contents.
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:22.060]   "Is that... mead?" Lycos finished for him, found their dozen wagons with barrels full
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.460]   of the stuff.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:29.740]   Nithair handed it back to him, and Lycos walked away, chuckling to himself, his vinthalant
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.300]   following him.
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:38.420]   Nithair headed for the wide stairs that scaled Drasil's walls and climbed to the top, stopping
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:42.980]   above the great gates where he stared out at the world beyond.
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:48.180]   A wide plain circled the fortress, clear blue sky bathing the ground in sunshine before
[00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:52.140]   the great trees of fawn blotted it from view.
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:57.380]   He caught a glimpse of Ilta just before she disappeared into the tree-line.
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:02.060]   Behind him, he heard the footsteps of Caesus and his eagle-guard stopping a respectful distance
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.140]   away.
[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:08.740]   The screams of the impaled in the courtyard were much fainter up here, fading to a pathetic
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.840]   mewling.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:14.260]   He wished he would just die.
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:17.380]   How have I allowed myself to come to this?
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.260]   This is for the greater good.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:23.140]   For me to win the war, Corbin must die.
[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:28.060]   To bring peace to the banish lands, Corbin must die.
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:32.900]   He felt his resolve stir, but still the screams wormed their way into his head, reminding
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:37.980]   him of other battles, other deaths in the name of this great cause.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:45.380]   And now I follow the path of Karushim, of demons, of Asroth himself.
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:50.800]   He remembered Caledus's words to him in Murias, so persuasive.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:55.780]   It had all been so logical when Caledus explained it, made sense of the alliances, the lies,
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:59.940]   deception upon deception, heaped in a great pile.
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:04.900]   But the truth is simpler, a voice seemed to whisper inside his mind.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.940]   Deep down, he knew.
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:12.640]   It was more basic when all was stripped away, Caledus's persuasive arguments and philosophical
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:17.420]   debates on good and evil, right and wrong, the abstract meanings that were attached
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:22.900]   to names, politics, power struggles, who deserved what.
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:27.120]   The honest answer was much simpler than any of those meandering debates, and one that
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:32.660]   had been clearly reinforced by his brief struggle with the Jihar warrior before him.
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:36.200]   I don't want to lose.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:43.600]   Chapter Three Coraline
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:49.560]   Coraline sat with her back to a tree, staring into the dawn gloom of fawn, absently twirling
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:52.820]   a knife between her fingers.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:56.180]   Behind her were the sleeping forms of three score or so of the survivors within she had
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:59.020]   fled Drassel.
[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:04.820]   Amongst them was Brinner, grey hair poking from beneath her cloak, beside her the bolts
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:09.240]   of Pharrell and Lafe curled close together.
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:15.360]   She glimpsed the Jihar, Akar, standing guard on the far side of their camp.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:19.840]   Exhaustion hovered at the fringes of her consciousness, and in so many ways it would
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.840]   be wonderful to lose herself in the nothingness of sleep.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.840]   But she couldn't.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:31.160]   Her mind was reeling, a whirlwind of grief, fear and rage as fractured moments of the previous
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.560]   day played out in her mind's eye.
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.680]   Most of them all, though.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.220]   Everything kept returning to one thought, circling.
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:43.060]   Where is Corbin?
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:47.940]   The fog of Titan has crept upon her again, a relentless assault, but she knew that sleep
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.140]   would not come.
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:53.780]   The shock and horror of yesterday's battle was still too present.
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:58.860]   There was a soft footfall from behind, and a figure came to stand beside her.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:35:59.860]   Gar.
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:05.340]   The lord of the Jihar looked at her, lines of worry etched upon his usually unreadable
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:07.140]   face.
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:12.140]   He was clothed in a shirt of dark chain mail, splattered with grime and blood.
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:16.300]   His curved sword sheathed across his back, a single bladed throwing axe hanging on his
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.380]   belt.
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.560]   Even he was not free of injury.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:24.140]   A blood-stained bandage was tied around his forehead.
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:29.700]   Storm is with him, Gar said, as if he could read her thoughts.
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:34.820]   "They must be as plain to read upon my face as our his."
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.620]   Storm.
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.220]   That was a measure of comfort.
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:43.740]   Corbin knew that the wolfen was a better guardian than a dozen shieldmen, but still,
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:48.820]   "We will find him," Gar said.
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:52.940]   Corbin had seen the familiar scuff marks of Storm's claws in the tunnel, which was why
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.420]   they had exited at this spot.
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:01.460]   After a brief search, she'd found more tracks, leading to the brow of the slope, but darkness
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:05.420]   has settled upon them, and no matter how frustrating it was pointless to stumble around
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.420]   in the dark.
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:10.740]   But where can Corbin be?
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:16.540]   He must have heard the din of battle from Drassil, even if he were this far away.
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:20.020]   The thoughts rose unbidden in her mind.
[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:25.020]   The one thought she'd refused to acknowledge throughout the long dark of night.
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:27.700]   What if he is slain?
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:31.500]   What else could have kept him from returning to Drassil?
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:36.460]   She felt a worm of fear wriggling through her belly, but refused to consider it.
[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:38.300]   He lives.
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.180]   He must.
[00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:42.860]   She nodded, and stood.
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:48.820]   She eating her knife, a myriad of cuts, bruises, and strains, aching for attention.
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:50.300]   She ignored them all.
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:54.140]   "We need to go," she said.
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:58.020]   "I," Gar agreed.
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.420]   He continued to stare at the trap-door.
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:06.660]   "I had hoped that Michael would find us, that he escaped."
[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:10.020]   Corbin remembered her last sight of the Benelium.
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:14.220]   Wielding his sword two handed, feet planted before the entrance to the tunnel in Drassil's
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:18.860]   great hall as they had retreated into its shadows.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:23.580]   Swaths of blood had surrounded him as he swung his sword in deadly arcs, holding back
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:27.500]   the enemy, protecting them, purchasing them time to escape.
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:33.620]   "He would have come by now, if he could," Corbin said.
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:36.780]   Gar sighed and nodded.
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:41.820]   Corbin cocked her head, listening, staring down the hill.
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:46.300]   Something was moving in the undergrowth, heading towards the trap-door.
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.220]   Gar saw it too, and without words the two of them separated, slipping into the shadows
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:54.140]   as they quietly surrounded the intruder.
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:39:00.020]   Bushes rustled, a twig snapped, and Corbin caught a glimpse of dark hair.
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:03.580]   She knew it wasn't Corbin, even he isn't that clumsy.
[00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:10.020]   A figure burst from the undergrowth, a young man clad in leather and wool, his dark hair
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:14.620]   tousled and a scabbing cut marking his forehead.
[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:19.500]   He started, at the sight of her, fumbled for a weapon and his belt, his eyes widening.
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:24.660]   "I know you," Corbin said, though she didn't remember his name.
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:32.500]   "Your dar is Attilius," a competent unassuming warrior, Attilius had been a slave oarsman
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.420]   on a Vinthallonship.
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:38.780]   The lad nodded, his lip trembling.
[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:39.780]   "Pax?
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:42.540]   What are you doing here?"
[00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:47.860]   Gar said, stepping silently from the shadows, making the young warrior jump again.
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:54.620]   "You must come quickly," Pax blurted, "My dar, Corbin, giants!"
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.100]   "Corbin?"
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:40:00.060]   Corbin hissed, "I, we must go."
[00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:05.060]   Tears were spilling down Pax's cheeks now, tracing tracks through blood and grime.
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:08.060]   "He's dead."
[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:12.620]   Corbin froze, feeling as if a fist had just clamped around her heart.
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:16.540]   "I ran," Pax said.
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:21.460]   He began to shake, an involuntary twitching that quickly became more violent.
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:24.580]   "Where is Corbin?"
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:29.540]   Corbin asked, trying to control the panic leaking through her, reaching out to grab the now-sobing
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:32.340]   boy and shake the sense from him.
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:37.540]   "Hold," Gar said, putting a hand upon her arm.
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:40.980]   "Pax, you must tell us as clearly as you can.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:44.940]   Where is Corbin and your dar, what happened?"
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:50.060]   Others were coming down the hill now, Corbin glimpsed Dath in colour, a handful of jihar,
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.060]   lathe looming behind them.
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:58.880]   "We heard, fighting, new Corbin was out there," Pax began, haltingly, "We found him, facing
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.380]   giants and bears."
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:01.380]   "What?"
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:04.740]   But there were no giants beneath their addressel.
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:10.940]   "Dar, he threw a spear at a giant, then we all ran, we thought we'd lost him, then—"
[00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:14.060]   "Go on," Gar said.
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:18.580]   The whole group was gathered around them now, listing in absolute silence.
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:28.220]   "They came from nowhere, my dar," he rubbed his eyes, blew out a long breath.
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:34.220]   "They, killed my dar," Corbin told me to run to fetch help.
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.500]   "When did this happen?"
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:40.060]   Gar asked, not able to keep the urgency from his voice.
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:44.820]   "Yesterday, after high sun before sunset—"
[00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:47.660]   Pax's face had grown paler as he spoke.
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.140]   Now he looked like a corpse.
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:53.380]   "I ran, I fell, hit my head."
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.780]   He raised a hand to the cut on his brow.
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:42:02.140]   "When I came to, it was dark, I've been trying to find my way since then."
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.780]   "Take us, now," Gar said.
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.100]   "I will try," Pax nodded.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:13.140]   "I became lost for a while, but I know it was that direction."
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:17.900]   Gar barked orders and then they were moving, Corbin taking the lead with Pax, Gar jogging
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:21.900]   beside the lad, a steadying hand on his arm.
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:28.220]   Corbin stormed, facing giants, alone, yesterday.
[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:34.460]   She sent a silent prayer to Elion, one of many that she had made over the last half-day.
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:37.260]   Let them still live.
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.060]   Corbin was the first to enter the Glade.
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:45.780]   At its far end was a sudden ridge, and beyond it the sound of a fast-flowing river.
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:52.820]   The smell hit her first, the metallic tang of blood and decay, death.
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:57.420]   Flies were buzzing in great clouds about bodies heaped on the floor.
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:03.100]   She counted three giant corpses on the ground, and a tillius pinned to a great oak by a giant's
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:04.740]   axe.
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.500]   She could not see Corbin or storm.
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:12.900]   She ran to the first giant, who was on his back, a hole in his belly, throat cleanly cut,
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:17.660]   his wrist bearing the telltale, ripping wounds of the wolfen.
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:23.100]   Corbin moved on, dimly aware of others spilling into the Glade behind her, the sound of Pax's
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:29.140]   sobs as he dropped to his knees before his dar, Gar's presence at her shoulder.
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:34.500]   The other two giants were close together, the ground trampled, rutted, dark and still
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.220]   sticky with blood.
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:42.940]   Corbin's throat had been ripped out by storm, the flesh mangled and torn.
[00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:46.340]   Here's not here, nor storm.
[00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:49.980]   The relief was a physical thing, though she knew their absence did not mean that they
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:55.620]   were safe or even alive, but it was clear they had fought here and won.
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:59.020]   They slew three giants.
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:01.700]   She felt a flush of pride at that feat.
[00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:05.540]   Knew that it would be a story told around the campfire this very night, adding to the
[00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:10.260]   tales that were growing up around Corbin and his wolfen companion.
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.860]   The other giant lay upon his front.
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:18.740]   Gar and Corbin tried to turn him over together, flies buzzed angrily, the huge warriors dead
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:21.500]   wait like a boulder.
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:26.020]   Farrell and Lath joined them, and together they rolled the giant, the stench of corruption
[00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:29.460]   and decay wafting up to them as they disturbed the body.
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:36.560]   The E is of the Choton clan, Lath spat, as they stood instead of the dead giant.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.060]   What are they doing here?
[00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:43.860]   Corbin's eyes were drawn to the glint of leather and iron amidst the congealed blood.
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:48.380]   She bent and wrapped a fist around the hilt of a sword buried deep in the giant's thigh,
[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:50.820]   angled upwards into its groin.
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:56.060]   It came free with a sucking sound, and she lifted it for them all to see, the pommel shaped
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:58.420]   like a howling wolfen.
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:02.580]   The relief she'd felt fled, replaced by the crushing weight of fear.
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:10.820]   "That ban sword," Dath said as he joined them, "color a pace behind him."
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:14.740]   Corbin stared at them a moment, caught a wave of sympathy for them.
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:18.580]   They'd been weighed less than two nights.
[00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:21.380]   Gar took the sword from her and stared at it.
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:25.380]   I watched Ban's Dar give him this blade.
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:30.340]   In the Rowan field at Duncarig, Farrell said, "I remember it."
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:34.220]   "And I," Dath muttered.
[00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:39.500]   Corbin turned away, her eyes scanning the ground, searching for any sign.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:46.500]   He is not here, Storm is not here, they escaped, but they did not make their way back to Drassel.
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.660]   Why?
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:51.620]   Brinner was on her knees beside the giant.
[00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:56.100]   The old healer had a file in one hand, a knife in the other that she was using to scrape blood
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.980]   from the trampled grass.
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:03.940]   One side of Brinner's face was still an angry red, seared by the explosions she had generated
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:07.740]   that had rocked the chamber in Drassel yesterday.
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:13.220]   Whatever benefit Brinner thought the giant's blood would bring, she was welcome to it.
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:18.140]   As Corbin scammed the rest of the clearing, her eyes caught a patch of crushed grass spattered
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:19.980]   with blood.
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:25.860]   It was close to the edge of the glade, leading to a sheer drop to the river below, as if
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:29.100]   something were dragged.
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:34.780]   She followed the marks and dropped to a crouch, looking down to the river.
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:38.540]   Further down she spied a dark smear on a boulder, blood.
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:43.700]   "They jumped into the river," she called out.
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:53.300]   Brinner was first to join her.
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:58.300]   Corbin led the way, running along the ridge that shadowed the river, twisting around thick
[00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:03.220]   rooted trees in dense vegetation, her eyes flitting between the path she was navigating
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:06.340]   and the banks of the river.
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:11.620]   Rounding a sharp bend in the path, she suddenly saw a shape lying on a grassy verge, firm
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:14.500]   matted, and blood stained.
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.660]   Her heart stopped.
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:20.340]   Storm She skilied to a halt on the ridge above the
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:25.620]   wolfen, her part of her mind noticing large boot prints in the grass.
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:30.580]   In a spray of dirt she scrambled over the edge, clinging to root and vine as she made
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.940]   her way down to the riverbank.
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:39.300]   Storm lay still as stone, and she was covered in blood a huge wound was visible above her
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.300]   shoulder.
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:45.980]   Corbin crouched, too scared to touch her, not wanting to confirm what her eyes were telling
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.940]   her.
[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:52.820]   Stifling tears, she remembered the first time she had seen Storm when she had threatened
[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:56.140]   to turn the wolfen into a cloak.
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:01.700]   Even then she had seen the bond between Corbin and his faithful and vigilant shadow.
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:06.460]   Since then, she had developed her own bond with the wolfen, more like a sword brother
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.300]   to her than a mere animal.
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:14.980]   As Gar joined her, she tentatively reached out her hand and laded upon Storm's body.
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:16.540]   She felt nothing.
[00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:20.700]   No, please, Elion above.
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:27.380]   She screwed her eyes shut tight, pressed harder, flattening her palm against Storm's deep chest,
[00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:33.260]   willing her hands to feel the movement of life a drawn breath the pumping of Storm's heart.
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:38.380]   With every moment, her hopes faded, a bleakness taking hold inside, spreading through her
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:40.460]   like ink through water.
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:48.780]   And then, she felt it, a flicker, a heartbeat deep within the cavern of Storm's broad chest.
[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:52.620]   Corbin opened her eyes and saw Storm's amber gaze regarding her.
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:58.860]   The wolfen whined, a weak, miserable sound, but one that gave Corbin a rush of joy.
[00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:05.700]   Storm's tail thumped feebly on the turf.
[00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:10.580]   After four, Corbin.
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:15.020]   Corbin walked through a world of gray, dimly aware that he was staggering close to a wide
[00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:16.020]   and dark river.
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:23.420]   There was a splash and a wide ripple, the hint of something large and sinuous in its depths.
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:28.700]   Bloated dark clouds boiled above him, flickering with lightning, and black shapes winged through
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:32.540]   them with an occasional gleam of chainmail and iron.
[00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:35.460]   This is the other world.
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:41.620]   His knee throbbed and a pain spasm through his chest with every in drawn breath.
[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:46.340]   He fixed his eyes on the ground before him, concentrated on each step.
[00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:50.260]   There had always been an element of the other world that calmed him, a serenity that settled
[00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:54.260]   within him that gave him a sense of strength and hope.
[00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:56.500]   But this time was different.
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:59.020]   There was something afraid about the peacefulness.
[00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:01.580]   It felt false.
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:07.500]   Everything lurked at the fringes of his mind, trying, needing to be remembered.
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:12.660]   When next he looked up, the river was flowing into a valley, cliffs rearing up by the side
[00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:15.620]   of him tall and forbidding.
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:19.780]   The head of him, the river spilt into a lake.
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:23.500]   Vibrant colour was seeping into the landscape with every step into the valley, the grass
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:28.860]   grew greener, the river bluer, as if colour was seeping up from the rock below.
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:33.820]   I know this place, have been here before.
[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:40.140]   The green valley and the lake of deep blue, gentle waves lapped against the shore.
[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:45.540]   A sound drew Corbin's eye towards the lake's heart, a splash and ripples, as if a stone
[00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:48.380]   had been thrown into water.
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:52.460]   His memory prodded at him and his eyes wandered back to the lake shore, searching for something
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:55.140]   else, and then he saw it.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:59.700]   The red-leafed maple that he had once sat beneath.
[00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:04.540]   Without thinking he made his way to it and sat down, his back to the trunk.
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:10.260]   Everything was still, no breeze to stir the grass or leaves, no harm of insects.
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:12.940]   The silence was oppressive.
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:19.380]   And then, high above, like a heartbeat, there was a beat of wings.
[00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:23.700]   He glanced up through the lattice of leaf and bark and saw a figure silhouetted against
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:29.620]   the clouds, human-like, a spear clutched in one hand, broad white feathered wings, powering
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:32.020]   through the air.
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:42.260]   The Benelim - Michael - Michael - Then, like an avalanche, he remembered.
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:47.340]   Michael, in the great hall of Drassil, telling Corbin about the deception of the Benelim,
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:52.420]   how the prophecy was nothing more than a strategy, a trick to force Asroth's hand to lure Calidus
[00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:58.660]   and the Catashim to Drassil, that the bright star and black sun were in invention, fabricated
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:02.380]   to snare Asroth in the trap of his own making.
[00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:07.580]   A sound strategy, maybe, in the great war between Benelim and Catashim, the faithful
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:14.380]   and the fallen, apart from the fact that it used people's lives like pawns on a throwboard.
[00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:19.980]   My dar's life, my mams, so many others.
[00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:25.820]   Rage swept through him, veined with betrayal at the memory of Michael's confession.
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:29.780]   He remembered resisting the urge to strike Michael, then leaving, knowing his rage was
[00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:35.860]   at the boundaries of his control, and had ended up sitting upon a hill in the forest.
[00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:40.500]   He had sat there a long time, contemplating Michael's words, trying to make some sense
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:43.580]   of what it would mean for the future.
[00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:52.620]   And then the jot on giants had come.
[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:58.980]   Images flickered through his mind, a bear roaring, spittle spraying from its red moor,
[00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:03.580]   running, foliage whipping his face, the thunder of the bear's pursuit, the wounds to his
[00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:10.500]   knee and chest, a spear piercing storm, a river, ice cold water.
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:14.740]   Some howling as giants had dragged him away from her side.
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:16.580]   Storm.
[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:20.620]   Pain shuttered through Corbin's chest as if someone were gripping his heart, squeezing
[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:22.060]   and twisting it.
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:24.900]   He couldn't breathe.
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:27.820]   His sorrow was a physical thing that crushed the air from his lungs.
[00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:32.900]   He staggered towards the lake, dropping to his knees at the water's edge.
[00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:38.260]   Even as he did so, more memories flooded his mind, an unstoppable wave of drassil, the
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:43.240]   frantic blowing of horns and sound of battle that had drifted up to him.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:50.480]   Images of his loved ones swam before his eyes, Corbin, Gar, Cohen, Dath and Farrell, Brinner,
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.980]   so many others.
[00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.780]   Do they still live?
[00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:57.980]   Who was attacking drassil?
[00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:01.940]   Dimly, he became aware of movement.
[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:07.060]   Before him, the water of the lake started to shift and foam, something rising from the
[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:08.060]   depths.
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:15.100]   A shape appeared, water cascading and masking for a moment, the creature within.
[00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:20.220]   Then a man was striding from the lake, with water dripping from the dark cloak that trailed
[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:22.500]   him like seaweed.
[00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:24.180]   He approached Corbin.
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:26.860]   An interested, amicable smile upon his face.
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:29.380]   His skin was gray-mottled and vain like a dead thing.
[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:32.340]   His hair was black and slick as oil.
[00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:36.060]   A black scabbarded sword hung at his hip.
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:43.140]   "Well," the man said, "it's not often that I get visitors."
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:47.660]   His voice was liquid, flowing like a shallow stream of a shingle.
[00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:51.420]   "What brings you to my home?"
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:55.780]   "I, I've been here before," Corbin said.
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:57.780]   "I know.
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:59.220]   I've watched you."
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:03.420]   "This is the other world," Corbin said.
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:11.020]   "It is, and this lake, this tree, this valley," the dark headman said with the wave of his
[00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:14.340]   hands, "are mine."
[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:15.820]   He shrugged.
[00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:17.700]   Water dripped from his hair.
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:19.180]   "Are you?"
[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:22.420]   "Ben Ellum," Corbin asked.
[00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:25.260]   The man laughed, a damp exhalation.
[00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:30.860]   "Those pompous fools know, though to my shame we are related."
[00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:34.220]   "Kadashim," Corbin asked fearful.
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:39.660]   "Hardly," the man snorted, "those fawning debauched deviance.
[00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:41.860]   Do I look like one of them?"
[00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:50.020]   "No," Corbin admitted, "well then, I am just me, Viathan."
[00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:55.260]   He lifted his hands, held one up to the sky, split his fingers.
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:58.220]   Corbin saw that they were wept like a frog's feet.
[00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:03.220]   "You are from the world of flesh, are you not?"
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:04.380]   The man said.
[00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:12.220]   Corbin nodded werily, "and what is your name, creature of flesh?"
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:17.020]   Viathan asked him, leaning in uncomfortably close.
[00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:21.020]   His breath washing over Corbin moist and full of rot.
[00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:28.500]   Corbin did not want to tell him, "I'm going to go now," he said, standing, wanting to
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:30.260]   be far away from his creature.
[00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:34.020]   "I don't think so," Viathan sighed.
[00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:40.220]   "I think we should continue this conversation somewhere a little more…private."
[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:45.180]   Corbin backed away, turning to leave.
[00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:47.260]   Something grabbed his ankle.
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:52.900]   Going down he saw that it was a tendril of Viathan's cloak, flexing like a grasping limb.
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:57.140]   It wrapped itself around his leg as Viathan walked back towards the lake, then, with shocking
[00:56:57.140 --> 00:57:02.540]   strength the cloak pulled tight and started dragging Corbin.
[00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:07.260]   For a moment, Corbin was too shocked to resist, but then he scrambled back, yanking at his
[00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:09.780]   ankle, hand grasping for his sword.
[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:15.820]   "Come on, don't dally," Viathan called over his shoulder as he reached the lake.
[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:19.740]   He walked in, sinking rapidly.
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:25.420]   The cloak seemed to split to flow, forming a myriad of strands, reaching up to Corbin,
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:30.020]   each one contracting around his ankles, wrists and throats.
[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:34.780]   Then he was being pulled down to the lake shore, just like a fly in a spider's web
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:36.540]   into the water.
[00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:41.180]   Panic filled him as his head sank beneath the surface, and he struggled desperately,
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:45.220]   straining, veins bulging, muscles screaming.
[00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:49.780]   With a sinew tearing effort, he pulled one arm free and then he was bursting out of the
[00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:54.780]   water, hoisted into the air, dangling before the creature, held up by his dark cloak that
[00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:59.140]   looked now more like a squirming nest of snakes.
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:04.140]   Corbin gasped for breath, gripping at the cloak strands, enclosing him to little effect.
[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:06.900]   Viathan regarded him with a cold fascination.
[00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:13.740]   "Tell me your name!" Viathan said, anger swelling in his voice, the crash of waves upon
[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:14.740]   rocks.
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:18.780]   "Let me go!" Corbin grunted through his constricted chest.
[00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:25.340]   "You have trespassed here," disturbed my rest, Viathan said wetly as he pulled Corbin
[00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:26.340]   closer.
[00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:37.260]   "In return, I will have some answers, and then, after, I may see how you taste."
[00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:40.860]   A wave of found breath engulfed Corbin, making his stomach lurch.
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:42.780]   "What are you?"
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:43.780]   Corbin coughed.
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:49.100]   "I am Viathan," the creature said.
[00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:53.740]   His mouth opening wide, seeming to grow before Corbin's eyes wider and wider, revealing
[00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:57.660]   rows of razor-sharp teeth glistening and dripping with mucus.
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:03.660]   "Eater of souls!"
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:09.740]   There was a whistling sound, and a spear slammed into Viathan's cloak, piercing it.
[00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:13.580]   Corbin screamed as Ben-Elium swept down from the sky.
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:17.180]   More spears flew, stabbing into Viathan's body.
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:22.300]   His yell deepened into a bellow of pain and rage, and Corbin found himself thrown to the
[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:26.940]   ground as the creature turned its attention to its attackers.
[00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:31.420]   Then hands were grasping Corbin, and he was hoisted into the air again.
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:37.980]   There was a Ben-Elium either side of him surging skywards, their wings beating hard.
[00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:41.460]   When heartbeats, the conflict in the lake was below them.
[00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:46.980]   Viathan and his living cloak sinking into the water, one strand quilling around a Ben-Elium,
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:49.980]   dragging it beneath the surface.
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:55.380]   The Ben-Elium's scream cut short as the water closed over its head.
[00:59:55.380 --> 01:00:00.340]   They flew higher, following the course of a winding valley, twisting and turning amongst

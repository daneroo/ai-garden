# Markdown Guidelines

Reference for markdown style conventions in this repository.

- Make markdown content markdownlint friendly.
  - Verify with `bunx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"` or
  - Verify with `npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"`
- Use unnumbered lists (`-`) instead of numbered lists (`1.`) to ease editing.
- Use unnumbered headers (no `1.`, `2.`) to ease reordering.
- Use bold and italics sparingly (exceptions only, not for every list item).
- MD022/blanks-around-headings: Headings should be surrounded by blank lines.
- MD032/blanks-around-lists: Lists should be surrounded by blank lines.

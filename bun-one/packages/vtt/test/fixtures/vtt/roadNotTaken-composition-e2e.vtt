00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.480
the road not taken by Robert Frost. Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, and, sorry, I could

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:19.040
not travel both and be one traveler, long I stood and looked down one as far as I could

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:26.720
to where it bent in the undergrowth. Then, took the other, as just as fair, and having

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.380
perhaps the better claim because it was grassy and wanted where. Though as for that, the

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.720
passing there had worn them really about the same, and both that morning, equally lay in

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:48.960
leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first, for another day. Yet, knowing how

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.960
way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:07.000
a sigh somewhere ages and ages hence. Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.760
less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.

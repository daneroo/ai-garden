# GPT4all - python bindings

By default, gpt4all models are stored in `~/.cache/gpt4all/`
but you can change this with model_path.

These models are the same as the GPT4All App's models,
which are located at `~/Library/Application\ Support/nomic.ai/GPT4All/`,
although they are name differently there.

If the file already exists, model download will be skipped.

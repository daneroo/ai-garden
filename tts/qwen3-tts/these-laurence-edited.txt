INSTRUMENTAL RELATIONS IN ARISTOTLE’S INTRINSIC TELEOLOGY

This thesis examines the scope of Aristotelian teleology. It challenges a narrowly intrinsic interpretation which rests on a dichotomous conception that only admits of two kinds of goal-directed movements, namely the actualization of one’s own nature, or the artificial and arbitrary use of another substance. The thesis aims at overcoming this dichotomy by highlighting the fact that there are intermediary cases according to Aristotle, i.e. that the relation between agent and patient is not always strictly intrinsic or extrinsic. The first chapter examines instrumental relations in crafts and the second chapter examines instrumental relations in nature, both of which are shown to have their place within Aristotle’s intrinsic view of teleology. Simply, the thesis argues that the self-actualization of natural substances should be viewed as the focal point rather than the exclusive subject of teleological accounts.

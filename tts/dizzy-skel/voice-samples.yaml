    Music filled the echoing space above the ancient, gleaming machines, sitting
    silently amongst the chattering throng of gaily dressed partygoers. She bowed
    graciously and smiled to a passing admiral and twirled a delicate black flower
    in her hand, putting the bloom to her nose to draw in its heady fragrance.

    The two men know each other too well for anything other than the real Zakalwe
    to work . . . likewise Tsoldrin Beychae and the political machine throughout
    the entire system. Too many memories involved altogether.

    Make my apologies to the System Times hacks, have them taken back to the city
    and released; give them a bottle of nightflor each. Cancel the photographer,
    give him one still camera and let him take sixty-four snaps, strictly full
    permission required. Have one of the male staff find Relstoch Sussepin and
    invite him to my apartments in two hours.
